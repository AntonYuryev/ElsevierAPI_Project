      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage : 800 mg orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). ( 2.1 ) Moderate Hepatic Impairment : 200 mg orally once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of pazopanib tablets is 800 mg (four 200 mg tablets) orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The dosage should be modified for hepatic impairment and in patients taking certain concomitant drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] . Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush tablets due to the potential for increased rate of absorption, which may affect systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If a dose is missed, it should not be taken if it is < 12 hours until the next dose. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Table 1 summarizes the recommended dose reductions. Table 1. Recommended Dose Reductions of Pazopanib Tablets for Adverse Reactions Dose reduction For renal cell carcinoma For soft tissue sarcoma First 400 mg orally once daily 600 mg orally once daily Second 200 mg orally once daily 400 mg orally once daily Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in patients unable to tolerate the second dose reduction. Table 2 summarizes the recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions. Table 2. Recommended Dosage Modifications of Pazopanib Tablets for Adverse Reactions Abbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ULN, upper limit of normal. a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Adverse reaction Severity a Dosage modification Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Isolated ALT elevations between 3 \u00d7 ULN and 8 \u00d7 ULN Continue and monitor liver function weekly until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Isolated ALT elevations of > 8 \u00d7 ULN Withhold until improvement to Grade 1 or baseline.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Toxicity : Severe and fatal hepatotoxicity has occurred. Monitor liver tests at baseline, regularly during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose with continued weekly monitoring for 8 weeks, or permanently discontinue with weekly monitoring until resolution based on severity of hepatotoxicity. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes : Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QT interval prolongation. Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes at baseline and as clinically indicated. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia prior to initiating pazopanib and during treatment. ( 5.2 , 12.2 ) Cardiac Dysfunction : Cardiac dysfunction, including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure, have occurred. Monitor blood pressure and manage as appropriate. Monitor for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Conduct baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold or permanently discontinue pazopanib based on severity of cardiac dysfunction. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Hemorrhagic Events : Fatal hemorrhagic events have occurred. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of hemorrhagic events. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Arterial Thromboembolic Events : Arterial thromboembolic events have been observed and can be fatal. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in case of an arterial thromboembolic event. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Venous Thromboembolic Events : Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been observed, including fatal pulmonary emboli (PE). Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold pazopanib and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE. ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Thrombotic Microangiopathy : Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), has been observed. Permanently discontinue pazopanib if TMA occurs. ( 2.2 , 5.7 ) Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula : Fatal perforation events have occurred. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Withhold pazopanib in case of Grade 2 or Grade 3 gastrointestinal fistula and resume based on medical judgement. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in case of gastrointestinal perforation or Grade 4 gastrointestinal fistula. ( 2.2 , 5.8 ) Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis : Can be fatal. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in patients who develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis. ( 2.2 , 5.9 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome : Can be fatal. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in patients who develop posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). ( 2.2 , 5.10 ) Hypertension : Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been observed. Do not initiate pazopanib in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating pazopanib. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated and initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold and then dose reduce pazopanib or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension. ( 2.2 , 5.11 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing : Withhold pazopanib for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of pazopanib after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.12 ) Hypothyroidism : Monitor thyroid tests at baseline, during treatment and as clinically indicated and manage hypothyroidism as appropriate. ( 5.13 ) Proteinuria : Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold pazopanib then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome. ( 2.2 , 5.14 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (some fatal) have been reported in patients with RCC and STS. Closely monitor patients at risk and treat as clinically indicated. ( 5.15 ) Infection : Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly. Consider interruption or discontinuation of pazopanib. ( 5.16 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and patients to use effective contraception. ( 5.19 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hepatic Toxicity Hepatotoxicity, manifested as increases in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin, occurred in patients who received pazopanib. This hepatotoxicity can be severe and fatal. Patients older than 65 years are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Transaminase elevations occur early in the course of treatment; 92% of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first 18 weeks. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 18% and ALT > 10 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4% of the 290 patients who received pazopanib. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2%. In the monotherapy trials, 2 patients died with disease progression and hepatic failure. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 18% and ALT > 8 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 5% of the 240 patients who received pazopanib. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2%. One patient died of hepatic failure. Monitor liver tests at baseline; at weeks 3, weeks 5, weeks 7, and weeks 9; at month 3 and month 4; and then periodically as clinically indicated. Increase to weekly monitoring for patients with elevated ALT until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose with continued weekly monitoring for 8 weeks, or permanently discontinue with weekly monitoring until resolution based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Gilbert\u2019s Syndrome Pazopanib is a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert\u2019s syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . In patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia known as Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, manage elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Concomitant Use of Simvastatin Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib. 5.2 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes In the RCC trials, 558/586 patients were subject to routine electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and QT prolongation \u2265 500 msec was identified in 2% of these 558 patients. In monotherapy trials, torsades de pointes occurred in < 1% of 977 patients who received pazopanib. In the randomized RCC (VEG105192) and STS (VEG110727) trials, 1% (3/290) and 0.4% (1/240) of patients, respectively, who received pazopanib had post-baseline values between 500 msec to 549 msec. Post-baseline QT data were only collected in the STS trial if ECG abnormalities were reported as an adverse reaction. Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Monitor ECG and electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) at baseline and as clinically indicated. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia prior to initiating pazopanib and during treatment. 5.3 Cardiac Dysfunction Cardiac dysfunction, including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure, occurred in patients who received pazopanib. In the RCC trials, cardiac dysfunction was observed in 0.6% of 586 patients without routine on-study LVEF monitoring. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), myocardial dysfunction was defined as symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or \u2265 15% absolute decline in LVEF compared with baseline or a decline in LVEF of \u2265 10% compared with baseline that is also below the lower limit of normal. In an RCC trial (COMPARZ), myocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% of the 362 patients on pazopanib who had a baseline and post-baseline LVEF measurements. Congestive heart failure occurred in 0.5% of patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), myocardial dysfunction occurred in 11% of the 142 patients who had a baseline and a post-baseline LVEF measurements. One percent (3/240) of patients who received pazopanib had congestive heart failure, which did not resolve in one patient. Fourteen of the 16 patients with myocardial dysfunction treated with pazopanib had concurrent hypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk (e.g., those with prior anthracycline therapy) possibly by increasing cardiac afterload. Monitor blood pressure and manage as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Monitor for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Conduct baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction, including previous anthracycline exposure. Withhold or permanently discontinue pazopanib based on severity of cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.4 Hemorrhagic Events In the RCC trials, fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.9% of 586 patients, and cerebral/intracranial hemorrhage was observed in < 1% (2/586) of patients treated with pazopanib. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), 13% of 290 patients treated with pazopanib experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were hematuria (4%), epistaxis (2%), hemoptysis (2%), and rectal hemorrhage (1%). Nine of 37 patients treated with pazopanib who had hemorrhagic events experienced serious events, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary hemorrhage. One percent of patients treated with pazopanib died from hemorrhage. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), 22% of 240 patients treated with pazopanib experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (8%), mouth hemorrhage (3%), and anal hemorrhage (2%). Grade 4 hemorrhagic events occurred in 1% of patients and included intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and peritoneal hemorrhage. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of hemorrhagic events [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.5 Arterial Thromboembolic Events In the RCC trials, fatal arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 0.3% of 586 patients. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), 2% of 290 patients who received pazopanib experienced myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.3% had a cerebrovascular accident, and 1% had an event of transient ischemic attack. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), 2% of 240 patients who received pazopanib experienced a myocardial infarction or ischemia and 0.4% had a cerebrovascular accident. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in case of an arterial thromboembolic event [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Venous Thromboembolic Events Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), including venous thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolus (PE), occurred in patients who received pazopanib. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), VTEs occurred in 1% of 290 patients who received pazopanib. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), VTEs were reported in 5% of 240 patients who received pazopanib. Fatal PE occurred in 1% (2/240). Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold pazopanib and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), occurred in clinical trials of pazopanib as monotherapy, in combination with bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan. Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Six of the 7 TMA cases occurred within 90 days of the initiation of pazopanib. Improvement of TMA was observed after treatment was discontinued. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TMA. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in patients developing TMA. Manage as clinically indicated. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula In the RCC and STS trials, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.9% of 586 patients and 1% of 382 patients who received pazopanib, respectively. Fatal perforations occurred in 0.3% (2/586) of these patients in the RCC trials and in 0.3% (1/382) of these patients in the STS trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Withhold pazopanib in case of Grade 2 or Grade 3 gastrointestinal fistula and resume based on medical judgement. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in case of gastrointestinal perforation or Grade 4 gastrointestinal fistula [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.9 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, has been reported with pazopanib across clinical trials. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with pazopanib. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in patients who develop ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients who received pazopanib and may be fatal. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Confirm diagnosis of PRES by magnetic resonance imaging. Permanently discontinue pazopanib in patients who develop PRES. 5.11 Hypertension Hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 100 mmHg) and hypertensive crisis were observed in patients treated with pazopanib. Approximately 40% of patients who received pazopanib experienced hypertension, with Grade 3 occurring in 4% to 7% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . About 40% of cases occurred by Day 9 and about 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks across clinical trials. Approximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of pazopanib because of hypertension. Do not initiate pazopanib in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating pazopanib. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated and initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold and then dose reduce pazopanib or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.12 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing complications can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, pazopanib has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold pazopanib at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of pazopanib after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.13 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism, confirmed based on a simultaneous rise of TSH and decline of T4, occurred in 7% of 290 patients who received pazopanib in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and in 5% of 240 patients who received pazopanib in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727). Hypothyroidism occurred in 4% of the 586 patients in the RCC trials and 5% of the 382 patients in the STS trials. Monitor thyroid tests at baseline, during treatment and as clinically indicated and manage hypothyroidism as appropriate. 5.14 Proteinuria In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), proteinuria occurred in 9% of 290 patients who received pazopanib. In 2 patients, proteinuria led to discontinuation of pazopanib. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), proteinuria occurred in 1% of 240 patients and nephrotic syndrome occurred in 1 patient. Treatment was discontinued in the patient with nephrotic syndrome. Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold pazopanib then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.15 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal cases, have been reported in RCC and STS patients treated with pazopanib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis, and treat as clinically indicated. 5.16 Infection Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), including some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of pazopanib for serious infections. 5.17 Increased Toxicity with Other Cancer Therapy Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Clinical trials of pazopanib in combination with pemetrexed and lapatinib were terminated early due to increased toxicity and mortality. The fatal toxicities observed included pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death. A safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens. 5.18 Increased Toxicity in Developing Organs The safety and effectiveness of pazopanib in pediatric patients have not been established. Pazopanib is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation in patients younger than 2 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 5.19 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, pazopanib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of pazopanib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mg (based on area under the curve [AUC]). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pazopanib and for at least 2 weeks following the final dose. Advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with pazopanib and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure of 977 patients who received pazopanib as a single agent, including 586 pazopanib-treated patients with RCC. With a median duration of treatment of 7.4 months (range, 0.1 to 27.6) in these 977 patients, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 586 patients were diarrhea, hypertension, hair color change, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, and vomiting. The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS also reflects exposure of 382 patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received pazopanib as a single agent, with a median duration of treatment of 3.6 months (range, 0 to 53). The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 382 patients were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased weight, hypertension, decreased appetite, vomiting, tumor pain, hair color changes, musculoskeletal pain, headache, dysgeusia, dyspnea, and skin hypopigmentation. Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of pazopanib was evaluated in 290 patients with RCC who participated in VEG105192, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The median duration of treatment was 7.4 months (range, 0 to 23) for patients who received pazopanib. Forty-two percent of patients on pazopanib required a dose interruption and 36% required a dose reduction. Table 3 presents adverse reactions in VEG105192. Table 3.

Elevated lipase as an adverse reaction was reported for 4% of 225 patients, including 2.7% (6/225) with Grade 3 and 0.4% (1/225) with Grade 4. In the RCC trials, clinical pancreatitis was observed in < 1% of 586 patients. Pneumothorax Two of 290 patients (0.7%) treated with pazopanib in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and 8 of 240 patients (3.3%) treated with pazopanib in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727) developed a pneumothorax. Bradycardia In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 280 patients treated with pazopanib. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 290 patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 238 patients treated with pazopanib. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 240 patients. Adverse Reactions in East Asian Patients In an analysis of pooled clinical trial data (N = 1,938) with pazopanib, Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia (12% versus 2%), thrombocytopenia (6% versus < 1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (6% versus 2%) were observed more frequently in patients of East Asian descent than in patients of non-East Asian descent. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post\u2011approval use of pazopanib. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Polycythemia Eye Disorders: Retinal detachment/tear Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis Metabolic and Nutrition Disorder: Tumor lysis syndrome (including fatal cases) Vascular Disorders: Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture (including fatal cases)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid co-administration of pazopanib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of pazopanib. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib is not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) CYP Substrates: Co-administration of pazopanib with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended. ( 7.2 ) Concomitant Use with Simvastatin: Concomitant use of pazopanib with simvastatin increases the risk of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations. Increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity. ( 7.3 ) Concomitant Use with Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents: Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib with gastric acid-reducing agents. Consider short-acting antacids in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours. ( 2.4 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Pazopanib Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Co-administration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 increases pazopanib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid co-administration of pazopanib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential. If co\u2011administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of pazopanib [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib is not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Transporters Co-administration of strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase pazopanib concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Consider selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP. 7.2 Effects of Pazopanib on Other Drugs CYP Substrates Co-administration of pazopanib with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 may result in inhibition of the metabolism of these products and create the potential for serious adverse reactions. The concomitant use of pazopanib with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Concomitant Use with Simvastatin Concomitant use of pazopanib with simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. Across clinical trials of pazopanib as a single agent, ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN was reported in 126/895 (14%) of patients who did not use statins compared with 11/41 (27%) of patients who had concomitant use of simvastatin. If a patient receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Concomitant use of pazopanib with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib with gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant administration with a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate short\u2011acting antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours to avoid a reduction in pazopanib exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval Pazopanib is associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Avoid co-administration of pazopanib with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , pazopanib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on pazopanib use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, oral administration of pazopanib to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the MRHD of 800 mg/day (based on AUC) ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects in clinically recognized pregnancies and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered oral pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating and for 6 days after mating, which resulted in increased pre-implantation loss and early resorptions at dosages greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Total litter resorption was seen at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Postimplantation loss, embryolethality, and decreased fetal body weights were noted in females administered doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral pazopanib was administered to pregnant animals during organogenesis. In rats, dose levels of greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) resulted in teratogenic effects, including cardiovascular malformations (retroesophageal subclavian artery, missing innominate artery, changes in the aortic arch), incomplete or absent ossification, increases in postimplantation loss, embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight. In rabbits, maternal toxicity, increased postimplantation loss and abortion were observed at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In addition, severe maternal body weight loss and 100% litter loss were observed at doses greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day (0.02-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day), while fetal weight was reduced at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (AUC not calculated). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of pazopanib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with pazopanib and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pazopanib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with pazopanib. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pazopanib and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Males Advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with pazopanib and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Based on findings from animal studies, pazopanib may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential while receiving treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of pazopanib in pediatric patients have not been established. Pazopanib is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] . Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation during early postnatal development. Administration of pazopanib to juvenile rats < 21 days old resulted in toxicity to the lungs, liver, heart, and kidney and in death at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose or doses tolerated in older animals (see Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data) . The safety and efficacy of pazopanib or an unapproved pazopanib formulation were investigated but not established in two open-label studies: a study in 37 pediatric patients 2 years to < 17 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumors [ NCT00929903 ] and a study in 46 pediatric patients 1 year to < 17 years with refractory solid tumors, including sarcoma [ NCT01956669 ]. Meaningful anti-tumor activity was not observed in these studies.] and a study in 46 pediatric patients 1 year to < 17 years with refractory solid tumors, including sarcoma [NCT01956669]. Meaningful anti-tumor activity was not observed in these studies. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In rats, weaning occurs at Day 21 postpartum which approximately equates to a human pediatric age of 2 years. In a juvenile animal toxicology study performed in rats, when animals were dosed from Day 9 through Day 14 postpartum (pre-weaning), pazopanib caused abnormal organ growth/maturation in the kidney, lung, liver, and heart at approximately 0.1-fold the AUC in adults at the MRHD of 800 mg/day of pazopanib. At approximately 0.4-fold the AUC in adults at the MRHD of 800 mg/day, pazopanib administration resulted in mortality. In repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats, including 4-week, 13-week, and 26-week administration, toxicities in bone, teeth, and nail beds were observed at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.07-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Doses of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) were not tolerated in 13-week and 26-week studies and animals required dose reductions due to body weight loss and morbidity. Hypertrophy of epiphyseal growth plates, nail abnormalities (including broken, overgrown, or absent nails) and tooth abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (including excessively long, brittle, broken, and missing teeth, and dentine and enamel degeneration and thinning) were observed in rats at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.35-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) at 26 weeks, with the onset of tooth and nail bed alterations noted clinically after 4 weeks to 6 weeks. Similar findings were noted in repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats dosed with pazopanib beginning Day 21 postpartum (post\u2011weaning). In the post-weaning animals, the occurrence of changes in teeth and bones occurred earlier and with greater severity than in older animals. There was evidence of tooth degeneration and decreased bone growth at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.1\u2011fold to 0.2-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Pazopanib exposure in juvenile rats was lower than that seen at the same dose levels in adult animals, based on comparative AUC values. At pazopanib doses approximately 0.5-fold to 0.7-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day, decreased bone growth in juvenile rats persisted even after the end of the dosing period. Finally, despite lower pazopanib exposures than those reported in adult animals or adult humans, juvenile animals administered 300 mg/kg/dose pazopanib required dose reduction within 4 weeks of dosing initiation due to significant toxicity, although adult animals could tolerate this same dose for at least 3 times as long [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use In pooled clinical trials with pazopanib, 30% of 2,080 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. More patients \u2265 65 years had ALT elevations > 3 \u00d7 ULN compared to patients < 65 years (23% versus 18%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In the RCC trials, 33% of 586 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of pazopanib were observed between these patients and younger patients. In the STS trials, 24% of 382 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. Patients aged \u2265 65 years had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 fatigue (19% versus 12% for patients aged < 65 years), hypertension (10% versus 6%), decreased appetite (11% versus 2%), ALT elevations (3% versus 2%) and AST elevations (4% versus 1%). In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), no overall differences in effectiveness of pazopanib were observed between patients aged \u2265 65 years and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (either total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and ALT > ULN or bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value). Pazopanib is not recommended in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) and severe (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet\u2011derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and FGFR-3, cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin-2 receptor-inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro , pazopanib inhibited ligand-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Kit, and PDGFR-\u03b2 receptors. In vivo , pazopanib inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in a mouse model, and the growth of some human tumor xenografts in mice. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increases in blood pressure have been observed and are related to steady-state trough plasma pazopanib concentrations. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT prolongation potential of pazopanib was assessed in a randomized, blinded, parallel trial (N = 96) using moxifloxacin as a positive control. Pazopanib 800 mg orally under fasting conditions was administered on Days 2 to 8 and 1,600 mg was administered on Day 9 after a meal in order to increase exposure to pazopanib and its metabolites. No large changes (i.e., > 20 msec) in QTc interval following exposure to pazopanib were detected in this QT trial. The trial was not able to exclude small changes (< 10 msec) in QTc interval, because assay sensitivity below this threshold (< 10 msec) was not established in this trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The recommended dosage of 800 mg once daily results in mean AUC of 1,037 mcg\u2022h/mL and C max of 58.1 mcg/mL. There was no consistent increase in AUC or C max at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. Administration of a single 400-mg crushed tablet increased AUC 0-72h by 46% and C max by approximately 2-fold and decreased T max by approximately 2 hours compared with administration of the whole tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Absorption The median time to achieve peak concentrations was 2 hours to 4 hours after a dose. Effect of Food Systemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat (approximately 50% fat) or low-fat (approximately 5% fat) meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and C max . Distribution Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was > 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Elimination Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 31 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Metabolism In vitro studies demonstrated that pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Excretion Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for < 4% of the administered dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Table 7 presents a comparison of the median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h values for patients with normal, mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The median steady-state of pazopanib C max and AUC 0-24h after a once-daily dose of 800 mg in patients with mild impairment were in a similar range as the median steady-state C max and median AUC 0-24h in patients with no hepatic impairment. The maximum tolerated pazopanib dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was 200 mg once daily. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h were approximately 43% and 29%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h were approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment.

Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitor : Co-administration of 1,500 mg lapatinib, a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP, with pazopanib 800 mg resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase in mean pazopanib AUC 0-24h and C max . CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 Substrates : Clinical studies, using pazopanib 800 mg once daily, have demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in patients with cancer. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 Substrates : Co-administration of pazopanib resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and C max , respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents : \u200b Co-administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and C max ) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited the activities of CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an in vitro human pregnane X receptor (PXR) assay. In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1) with IC 50 s of 1.2 \u00b5M and 0.79 \u00b5M, respectively. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Pazopanib can increase serum total bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet\u2011derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and FGFR-3, cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin-2 receptor-inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro , pazopanib inhibited ligand-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Kit, and PDGFR-\u03b2 receptors. In vivo , pazopanib inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in a mouse model, and the growth of some human tumor xenografts in mice."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increases in blood pressure have been observed and are related to steady-state trough plasma pazopanib concentrations. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT prolongation potential of pazopanib was assessed in a randomized, blinded, parallel trial (N = 96) using moxifloxacin as a positive control. Pazopanib 800 mg orally under fasting conditions was administered on Days 2 to 8 and 1,600 mg was administered on Day 9 after a meal in order to increase exposure to pazopanib and its metabolites. No large changes (i.e., > 20 msec) in QTc interval following exposure to pazopanib were detected in this QT trial. The trial was not able to exclude small changes (< 10 msec) in QTc interval, because assay sensitivity below this threshold (< 10 msec) was not established in this trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The recommended dosage of 800 mg once daily results in mean AUC of 1,037 mcg\u2022h/mL and C max of 58.1 mcg/mL. There was no consistent increase in AUC or C max at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. Administration of a single 400-mg crushed tablet increased AUC 0-72h by 46% and C max by approximately 2-fold and decreased T max by approximately 2 hours compared with administration of the whole tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Absorption The median time to achieve peak concentrations was 2 hours to 4 hours after a dose. Effect of Food Systemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat (approximately 50% fat) or low-fat (approximately 5% fat) meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and C max . Distribution Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was > 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Elimination Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 31 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Metabolism In vitro studies demonstrated that pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Excretion Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for < 4% of the administered dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Table 7 presents a comparison of the median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h values for patients with normal, mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The median steady-state of pazopanib C max and AUC 0-24h after a once-daily dose of 800 mg in patients with mild impairment were in a similar range as the median steady-state C max and median AUC 0-24h in patients with no hepatic impairment. The maximum tolerated pazopanib dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was 200 mg once daily. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h were approximately 43% and 29%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h were approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment.

Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitor : Co-administration of 1,500 mg lapatinib, a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP, with pazopanib 800 mg resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase in mean pazopanib AUC 0-24h and C max . CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 Substrates : Clinical studies, using pazopanib 800 mg once daily, have demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in patients with cancer. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 Substrates : Co-administration of pazopanib resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and C max , respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents : \u200b Co-administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and C max ) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited the activities of CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an in vitro human pregnane X receptor (PXR) assay. In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1) with IC 50 s of 1.2 \u00b5M and 0.79 \u00b5M, respectively."

Administration of pazopanib to mice for 2 years did not result in increased incidence of neoplasms at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Administration of pazopanib to rats for 2 years resulted in findings of duodenal adenocarcinoma in males at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) and in females at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3\u2011fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). The human relevance of these neoplastic findings is unclear. Pazopanib did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. In an oral female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating, and for 6 days after mating. Pazopanib did affect fertility in female rats. Reduced fertility, including increased pre-implantation loss and early resorptions, were noted at dosages greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Decreased corpora lutea and increased cysts were noted in mice given greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks and ovarian atrophy was noted in rats given greater than or equal to 300 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks (approximately 1.3-fold and 0.85-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Decreased corpora lutea was also noted in monkeys given 500 mg/kg/day for up to 34 weeks (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Pazopanib did not affect mating or fertility in male rats. However, there were reductions in sperm production rates and testicular sperm concentrations at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day, epididymal sperm concentrations at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day, and sperm motility at greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day following 15 weeks of dosing. Following 15 weeks and 26 weeks of dosing, there were decreased testicular and epididymal weights at doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.35-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day); atrophy and degeneration of the testes with aspermia, hypospermia, and cribiform change in the epididymis was also observed at this dose in the 6\u2011month toxicity studies in male rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma The efficacy of pazopanib was evaluated in VEG105192, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial ( NCT00387764 ). Patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who had received either no prior therapy or one prior cytokine-based systemic therapy were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo once daily. Eligible subjects were stratified according to the following 3 stratification factors: baseline ECOG performance status 0 versus 1; prior nephrectomy yes versus no; and prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC: treatment-na\u00efve versus one prior cytokine-based therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional outcome measures were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response. Of the total of 435 patients enrolled in this trial, 233 patients had no prior systemic therapy (treatment-na\u00efve subgroup) and 202 patients received one prior IL-2 or INF\u03b1-based therapy (cytokine-pretreated subgroup). The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the arms receiving pazopanib and placebo. The majority of patients were male (71%) with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-six percent of patients were white, 14% were Asian, and < 1% were other. Forty-two percent were ECOG performance status 0 and 58% were ECOG performance status 1. All patients had clear cell histology (90%) or predominantly clear cell histology (10%). Approximately 50% of all patients had 3 or more organs involved with metastatic disease. The most common metastatic sites at baseline were lung (74%), lymph nodes (56%), bone (27%), and liver (25%). A similar proportion of patients in each arm were treatment-na\u00efve and cytokine-pretreated (see Table 8). In the cytokine-pretreated subgroup, the majority (75%) had received interferon-based treatment. Similar proportions of patients in each arm had prior nephrectomy (89% and 88% for pazopanib and placebo, respectively). The analysis of the primary endpoint PFS was based on disease assessment by independent radiological review in the entire trial population. Efficacy results are presented in Table 8 and Figure 1.

Patients with metastatic STS who had received prior chemotherapy, including anthracycline treatment, or were unsuited for such therapy, were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo. Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) or adipocytic sarcoma were excluded from the trial. Randomization was stratified by the factors of WHO performance status (WHO PS) 0 or 1 at baseline and the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 versus 2+). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS assessed by independent radiological review. Additional outcome measures were OS, ORR, and duration of response.

If pazopanib tablets are used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reduce the pazopanib tablets dose to 200 mg orally once daily. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors by use of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, reduce the dose of pazopanib tablets to 400 mg [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers by use of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended in patients who cannot avoid chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant use of a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacid in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate short-acting antacid and pazopanib tablets dosing by several hours [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

( 2.2 , 5.9 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome: Can be fatal. Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in patients who develop posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). ( 2.2 , 5.10 ) Hypertension: Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been observed. Do not initiate pazopanib tablets in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating pazopanib tablets. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated and initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold and then dose reduce pazopanib tablets or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension. ( 2.2 , 5.11 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold pazopanib tablets for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of pazopanib tablets after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.12 ) Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid tests at baseline, during treatment and as clinically indicated and manage hypothyroidism as appropriate. ( 5.13 ) Proteinuria: Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold pazopanib tablets then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome. ( 2.2 , 5.14 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (some fatal) have been reported in patients with RCC and STS. Closely monitor patients at risk and treat as clinically indicated. ( 5.15 ) Infection: Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly. Consider interruption or discontinuation of pazopanib tablets. ( 5.16 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and patients to use effective contraception. ( 5.19 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hepatic Toxicity Hepatotoxicity, manifested as increases in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin, occurred in patients who received pazopanib tablets. This hepatotoxicity can be severe and fatal. Patients older than 65 years are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Transaminase elevations occur early in the course of treatment; 92% of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first 18 weeks. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 18% and ALT > 10 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4% of the 290 patients who received pazopanib tablets. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2%. In the monotherapy trials, 2 patients died with disease progression and hepatic failure. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 18% and ALT > 8 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 5% of the 240 patients who received pazopanib tablets. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2%. One patient died of hepatic failure. Monitor liver tests at baseline; at Weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9; at Month 3 and Month 4; and then periodically as clinically indicated. Increase to weekly monitoring for patients with elevated ALT until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at reduced dose with continued weekly monitoring for 8 weeks, or permanently discontinue with weekly monitoring until resolution based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Gilbert's Syndrome Pazopanib is a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert's syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. In patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia known as Gilbert's syndrome, manage elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Concomitant Use of Simvastatin Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib tablets. 5.2 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes In the RCC trials, 558/586 patients were subject to routine electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and QT prolongation \u2265500 msec was identified in 2% of these 558 patients. In monotherapy trials, torsades de pointes occurred in <1% of 977 patients who received pazopanib tablets. In the randomized RCC (VEG105192) and STS (VEG110727) trials, 1% (3/290) and 0.4% (1/240) of patients, respectively, who received pazopanib tablets had post-baseline values between 500 to 549 msec. Post-baseline QT data were only collected in the STS trial if ECG abnormalities were reported as an adverse reaction. Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and those with relevant preexisting cardiac disease [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. Monitor ECG and electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) at baseline and as clinically indicated. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia prior to initiating pazopanib tablets and during treatment. 5.3 Cardiac Dysfunction Cardiac dysfunction, including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure, occurred in patients who received pazopanib tablets. In the RCC trials, cardiac dysfunction was observed in 0.6% of 586 patients without routine on-study LVEF monitoring. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), myocardial dysfunction was defined as symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or \u226515% absolute decline in LVEF compared with baseline or a decline in LVEF of \u226510% compared with baseline that is also below the lower limit of normal. In an RCC trial (COMPARZ), myocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% of the 362 patients on pazopanib tablets who had a baseline and post-baseline LVEF measurements. Congestive heart failure occurred in 0.5% of patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), myocardial dysfunction occurred in 11% of the 142 patients who had a baseline and a post-baseline LVEF measurements. One percent (3/240) of patients who received pazopanib tablets had congestive heart failure, which did not resolve in one patient. Fourteen of the 16 patients with myocardial dysfunction treated with pazopanib tablets had concurrent hypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk (e.g., those with prior anthracycline therapy) possibly by increasing cardiac afterload. Monitor blood pressure and manage as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Monitor for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Conduct baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction, including previous anthracycline exposure. Withhold or permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets based on severity of cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.4 Hemorrhagic Events In the RCC trials, fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.9% of 586 patients, and cerebral/intracranial hemorrhage was observed in <1% (2/586) of patients treated with pazopanib tablets. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), 13% of 290 patients treated with pazopanib tablets experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were hematuria (4%), epistaxis (2%), hemoptysis (2%), and rectal hemorrhage (1%). Nine of 37 patients treated with pazopanib tablets who had hemorrhagic events experienced serious events, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary hemorrhage. One percent of patients treated with pazopanib tablets died from hemorrhage. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), 22% of 240 patients treated with pazopanib tablets experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (8%), mouth hemorrhage (3%), and anal hemorrhage (2%). Grade 4 hemorrhagic events occurred in 1% of patients and included intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and peritoneal hemorrhage. Pazopanib tablets have not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of hemorrhagic events [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.5 Arterial Thromboembolic Events In the RCC trials, fatal arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 0.3% of 586 patients. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), 2% of 290 patients who received pazopanib tablets experienced myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.3% had a cerebrovascular accident, and 1% had an event of transient ischemic attack. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), 2% of 240 patients who received pazopanib tablets experienced a myocardial infarction or ischemia and 0.4% had a cerebrovascular accident. Pazopanib tablets have not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in case of an arterial thromboembolic event [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.6 Venous Thromboembolic Events Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), including venous thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolus (PE), occurred in patients who received pazopanib tablets. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), VTEs occurred in 1% of 290 patients who received pazopanib tablets. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), VTEs were reported in 5% of 240 patients who received pazopanib tablets. Fatal PE occurred in 1% (2/240). Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold pazopanib tablets and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), occurred in clinical trials of pazopanib tablets as monotherapy, in combination with bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan. Pazopanib tablets are not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Six of the 7 TMA cases occurred within 90 days of the initiation of pazopanib tablets. Improvement of TMA was observed after treatment was discontinued. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TMA. Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in patients developing TMA. Manage as clinically indicated. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula In the RCC and STS trials, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.9% of 586 patients and 1% of 382 patients who received pazopanib tablets, respectively. Fatal perforations occurred in 0.3% (2/586) of these patients in the RCC trials and in 0.3% (1/382) of these patients in the STS trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Withhold pazopanib tablets in case of Grade 2 or 3 gastrointestinal fistula and resume based on medical judgement. Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in case of gastrointestinal perforation or Grade 4 gastrointestinal fistula [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.9 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, has been reported with pazopanib tablets across clinical trials. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with pazopanib tablets. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in patients who develop ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients who received pazopanib tablets and may be fatal. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Confirm diagnosis of PRES by magnetic resonance imaging. Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in patients who develop PRES. 5.11 Hypertension Hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265100 mmHg) and hypertensive crisis were observed in patients treated with pazopanib tablets. Approximately 40% of patients who received pazopanib tablets experienced hypertension, with Grade 3 occurring in 4% to 7% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. About 40% of cases occurred by Day 9 and about 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks across clinical trials. Approximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of pazopanib tablets because of hypertension. Do not initiate pazopanib tablets in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating pazopanib tablets. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated and initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold and then dose reduce pazopanib tablets or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.12 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing complications can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, pazopanib tablets have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold pazopanib tablets at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of pazopanib tablets after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.13 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism, confirmed based on a simultaneous rise of TSH and decline of T4, occurred in 7% of 290 patients who received pazopanib tablets in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and in 5% of 240 patients who received pazopanib tablets in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727). Hypothyroidism occurred in 4% of the 586 patients in the RCC trials and 5% of the 382 patients in the STS trials. Monitor thyroid tests at baseline, during treatment and as clinically indicated and manage hypothyroidism as appropriate. 5.14 Proteinuria In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), proteinuria occurred in 9% of 290 patients who received pazopanib tablets. In 2 patients, proteinuria led to discontinuation of pazopanib tablets. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), proteinuria occurred in 1% of 240 patients and nephrotic syndrome occurred in 1 patient. Treatment was discontinued in the patient with nephrotic syndrome. Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold pazopanib tablets then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.15 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal cases, have been reported in RCC and STS patients treated with pazopanib tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis, and treat as clinically indicated. 5.16 Infection Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), including some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of pazopanib tablets for serious infections. 5.17 Increased Toxicity With Other Cancer Therapy Pazopanib tablets are not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Clinical trials of pazopanib tablets in combination with pemetrexed and lapatinib were terminated early due to increased toxicity and mortality. The fatal toxicities observed included pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death. A safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens. 5.18 Increased Toxicity in Developing Organs The safety and effectiveness of pazopanib tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Pazopanib tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation in patients younger than 2 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 5.19 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, pazopanib tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of pazopanib tablets to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mg (based on area under the curve [AUC]). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pazopanib tablets and for at least 2 weeks following the final dose. Advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with pazopanib tablets and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

Soft Tissue Sarcoma The safety of pazopanib tablets was evaluated in 240 patients who participated in VEG110727, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The median duration of treatment was 4.5 months (range, 0 to 24) for patients who received pazopanib tablets. Fifty-eight percent of patients on pazopanib tablets required a dose interruption and 38% required a dose reduction. Seventeen percent of patients who received pazopanib tablets discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. Table 5 presents the adverse reactions in VEG110727. Table 5.

Elevated lipase as an adverse reaction was reported for 4% of 225 patients, including 2.7% (6/225) with Grade 3 and 0.4% (1/225) with Grade 4. In the RCC trials, clinical pancreatitis was observed in < 1% of 586 patients. Pneumothorax Two of 290 patients (0.7%) treated with pazopanib tablets in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and 8 of 240 patients (3.3%) treated with pazopanib tablets in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727) developed a pneumothorax. Bradycardia In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 280 patients treated with pazopanib tablets. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 290 patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 238 patients treated with pazopanib tablets. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 240 patients. Adverse Reactions in East Asian Patients In an analysis of pooled clinical trial data (N = 1,938) with pazopanib tablets, Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia (12% versus 2%), thrombocytopenia (6% versus < 1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (6% versus 2%) were observed more frequently in patients of East Asian descent than in patients of non-East Asian descent. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pazopanib tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Polycythemia Eye Disorders : Retinal detachment/tear Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis Metabolic and Nutrition Disorder : Tumor lysis syndrome (including fatal cases) Vascular Disorders : Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture (including fatal cases)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of pazopanib tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of pazopanib tablets. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) CYP Substrates: Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended. ( 7.2 ) Concomitant Use With Simvastatin: Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with simvastatin increases the risk of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations. Increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity. ( 7.3 ) Concomitant Use With Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents: Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with gastric acid-reducing agents. Consider short-acting antacids in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours. ( 2.4 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Pazopanib Tablets Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 increases pazopanib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid coadministration of pazopanib tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of pazopanib tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Transporters Coadministration of strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase pazopanib concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Consider selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP. 7.2 Effects of Pazopanib Tablets on Other Drugs CYP Substrates Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 may result in inhibition of the metabolism of these products and create the potential for serious adverse reactions. The concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Concomitant Use With Simvastatin Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. Across clinical trials of pazopanib tablets as a single agent, ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN was reported in 126/895 (14%) of patients who did not use statins compared with 11/41 (27%) of patients who had concomitant use of simvastatin. If a patient receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib tablets. 7.4 Concomitant Use With Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant administration with a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate short-acting antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours to avoid a reduction in pazopanib exposure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.5 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval Pazopanib tablets are associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Avoid coadministration of pazopanib tablets with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , pazopanib tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on pazopanib use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, oral administration of pazopanib to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the MRHD of 800 mg/day (based on AUC) ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects in clinically recognized pregnancies and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered oral pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating and for 6 days after mating, which resulted in increased pre-implantation loss and early resorptions at dosages greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Total litter resorption was seen at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Postimplantation loss, embryolethality, and decreased fetal body weights were noted in females administered doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral pazopanib was administered to pregnant animals during organogenesis. In rats, dose levels of greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) resulted in teratogenic effects, including cardiovascular malformations (retroesophageal subclavian artery, missing innominate artery, changes in the aortic arch), incomplete or absent ossification, increases in postimplantation loss, embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight. In rabbits, maternal toxicity, increased postimplantation loss and abortion were observed at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In addition, severe maternal body weight loss and 100% litter loss were observed at doses greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day (0.02-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day), while fetal weight was reduced at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (AUC not calculated). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of pazopanib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with pazopanib tablets and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pazopanib tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with pazopanib tablets. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pazopanib tablets and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Males Advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with pazopanib tablets and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Based on findings from animal studies, pazopanib tablets may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential while receiving treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of pazopanib tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Pazopanib tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)] . Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation during early postnatal development. Administration of pazopanib to juvenile rats < 21 days old resulted in toxicity to the lungs, liver, heart, and kidney and in death at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose or doses tolerated in older animals (see Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data) . The safety and efficacy of pazopanib tablets or an unapproved pazopanib formulation were investigated but not established in two open-label studies: a study in 37 pediatric patients 2 to < 17 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumors [ NCT00929903 ] and a study in 46 pediatric patients 1 year to < 17 years with refractory solid tumors, including sarcoma [ NCT01956669 ]. Meaningful anti-tumor activity was not observed in these studies. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In rats, weaning occurs at Day 21 postpartum which approximately equates to a human pediatric age of 2 years. In a juvenile animal toxicology study performed in rats, when animals were dosed from Day 9 through Day 14 postpartum (pre-weaning), pazopanib caused abnormal organ growth/maturation in the kidney, lung, liver, and heart at approximately 0.1-fold the AUC in adults at the MRHD of 800 mg/day of pazopanib tablets. At approximately 0.4-fold the AUC in adults at the MRHD of 800 mg/day, pazopanib administration resulted in mortality. In repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats, including 4-week, 13-week, and 26-week administration, toxicities in bone, teeth, and nail beds were observed at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.07-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Doses of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) were not tolerated in 13- and 26-week studies and animals required dose reductions due to body weight loss and morbidity. Hypertrophy of epiphyseal growth plates, nail abnormalities (including broken, overgrown, or absent nails) and tooth abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (including excessively long, brittle, broken, and missing teeth, and dentine and enamel degeneration and thinning) were observed in rats at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.35-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) at 26 weeks, with the onset of tooth and nail bed alterations noted clinically after 4 to 6 weeks. Similar findings were noted in repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats dosed with pazopanib beginning Day 21 postpartum (post-weaning). In the post-weaning animals, the occurrence of changes in teeth and bones occurred earlier and with greater severity than in older animals. There was evidence of tooth degeneration and decreased bone growth at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.1- to 0.2-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Pazopanib exposure in juvenile rats was lower than that seen at the same dose levels in adult animals, based on comparative AUC values. At pazopanib doses approximately 0.5- to 0.7-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day, decreased bone growth in juvenile rats persisted even after the end of the dosing period. Finally, despite lower pazopanib exposures than those reported in adult animals or adult humans, juvenile animals administered 300 mg/kg/dose pazopanib required dose reduction within 4 weeks of dosing initiation due to significant toxicity, although adult animals could tolerate this same dose for at least 3 times as long [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use In pooled clinical trials with pazopanib tablets, 30% of 2,080 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. More patients \u2265 65 years had ALT elevations > 3 \u00d7 ULN compared to patients < 65 years (23% versus 18%) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In the RCC trials, 33% of 586 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of pazopanib tablets were observed between these patients and younger patients. In the STS trials, 24% of 382 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. Patients aged \u2265 65 years had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 fatigue (19% versus 12% for patients aged < 65 years), hypertension (10% versus 6%), decreased appetite (11% versus 2%), ALT elevations (3% versus 2%) and AST elevations (4% versus 1%). In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), no overall differences in effectiveness of pazopanib tablets were observed between patients aged \u2265 65 years and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. Pazopanib tablets have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (either total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and ALT > ULN or bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value). Pazopanib tablets are not recommended in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) and severe (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , pazopanib tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on pazopanib use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, oral administration of pazopanib to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the MRHD of 800 mg/day (based on AUC) ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects in clinically recognized pregnancies and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered oral pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating and for 6 days after mating, which resulted in increased pre-implantation loss and early resorptions at dosages greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Total litter resorption was seen at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Postimplantation loss, embryolethality, and decreased fetal body weights were noted in females administered doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral pazopanib was administered to pregnant animals during organogenesis. In rats, dose levels of greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) resulted in teratogenic effects, including cardiovascular malformations (retroesophageal subclavian artery, missing innominate artery, changes in the aortic arch), incomplete or absent ossification, increases in postimplantation loss, embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight. In rabbits, maternal toxicity, increased postimplantation loss and abortion were observed at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In addition, severe maternal body weight loss and 100% litter loss were observed at doses greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day (0.02-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day), while fetal weight was reduced at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (AUC not calculated)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and -3, cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin-2 receptor-inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro, pazopanib inhibited ligand-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Kit, and PDGFR-\u03b2 receptors. In vivo, pazopanib inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in a mouse model, and the growth of some human tumor xenografts in mice. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increases in blood pressure have been observed and are related to steady-state trough plasma pazopanib concentrations. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT prolongation potential of pazopanib was assessed in a randomized, blinded, parallel trial (N = 96) using moxifloxacin as a positive control. Pazopanib tablets 800 mg orally under fasting conditions was administered on Days 2 to 8 and 1,600 mg was administered on Day 9 after a meal in order to increase exposure to pazopanib and its metabolites. No large changes (i.e., > 20 msec) in QTc interval following exposure to pazopanib were detected in this QT trial. The trial was not able to exclude small changes (< 10 msec) in QTc interval, because assay sensitivity below this threshold (< 10 msec) was not established in this trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The recommended dosage of 800 mg once daily results in mean AUC of 1,037 mcg\u2022h/mL and C max of 58.1 mcg/mL. There was no consistent increase in AUC or C max at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. Administration of a single 400-mg crushed tablet increased AUC 0 to 72h by 46% and C max by approximately 2-fold and decreased T max by approximately 2 hours compared with administration of the whole tablet [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Absorption The median time to achieve peak concentrations was 2 to 4 hours after a dose. Effect of Food Systemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat (approximately 50% fat) or low-fat (approximately 5% fat) meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and C max . Distribution Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was > 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Elimination Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 31 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Metabolism In vitro studies demonstrated that pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Excretion Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for < 4% of the administered dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Table 7 presents a comparison of the median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0 to 24h values for patients with normal, mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The median steady-state of pazopanib C max and AUC 0 to 24h after a once-daily dose of 800 mg in patients with mild impairment were in a similar range as the median steady-state C max and median AUC 0 to 24h in patients with no hepatic impairment. The maximum tolerated pazopanib dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was 200 mg once daily. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0 to 24h were approximately 43% and 29%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0 to 24h were approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment.

Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitor: Coadministration of 1,500 mg lapatinib, a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP, with pazopanib tablets 800 mg resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase in mean pazopanib AUC 0 to 24h and C max . CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 Substrates: Clinical studies, using pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily, have demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in patients with cancer. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 Substrates: Coadministration of pazopanib tablets resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Coadministration of pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and C max , respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents : Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and C max ) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited the activities of CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an in vitro human pregnane X receptor (PXR) assay. In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1) with IC 50S of 1.2 and 0.79 \u03bcM, respectively. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Pazopanib can increase serum total bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In vitro studies showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1, which glucuronidates bilirubin for elimination. A pooled pharmacogenetic analysis of 236 white patients who received pazopanib tablets showed that the (TA)7/(TA)7 genotype (UGT1A1*28/*28) (underlying genetic susceptibility to Gilbert's syndrome) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia relative to the (TA)6/(TA)6 and (TA)6/(TA)7 genotypes. In a pooled pharmacogenetic analysis of data from 31 clinical studies of pazopanib administered as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents, ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN (Grade 2) occurred in 32% (42/133) of HLA-B*57:01 allele carriers and in 19% (397/2,101) of non-carriers and ALT > 5 \u00d7 ULN (Grade 3) occurred in 19% (25/133) of HLA-B*57:01 allele carriers and in 10% (213/2,101) of non-carriers. In this dataset, 6% (133/2,234) of the patients carried the HLA-B*57:01 allele [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

No large changes (i.e., > 20 msec) in QTc interval following exposure to pazopanib were detected in this QT trial. The trial was not able to exclude small changes (< 10 msec) in QTc interval, because assay sensitivity below this threshold (< 10 msec) was not established in this trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The recommended dosage of 800 mg once daily results in mean AUC of 1,037 mcg\u2022h/mL and C max of 58.1 mcg/mL. There was no consistent increase in AUC or C max at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. Administration of a single 400-mg crushed tablet increased AUC 0 to 72h by 46% and C max by approximately 2-fold and decreased T max by approximately 2 hours compared with administration of the whole tablet [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Absorption The median time to achieve peak concentrations was 2 to 4 hours after a dose. Effect of Food Systemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat (approximately 50% fat) or low-fat (approximately 5% fat) meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and C max . Distribution Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was > 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Elimination Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 31 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Metabolism In vitro studies demonstrated that pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Excretion Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for < 4% of the administered dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Table 7 presents a comparison of the median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0 to 24h values for patients with normal, mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The median steady-state of pazopanib C max and AUC 0 to 24h after a once-daily dose of 800 mg in patients with mild impairment were in a similar range as the median steady-state C max and median AUC 0 to 24h in patients with no hepatic impairment. The maximum tolerated pazopanib dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was 200 mg once daily. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0 to 24h were approximately 43% and 29%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0 to 24h were approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment.

Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitor: Coadministration of 1,500 mg lapatinib, a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP, with pazopanib tablets 800 mg resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase in mean pazopanib AUC 0 to 24h and C max . CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 Substrates: Clinical studies, using pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily, have demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in patients with cancer. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 Substrates: Coadministration of pazopanib tablets resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Coadministration of pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and C max , respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents : Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and C max ) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited the activities of CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an in vitro human pregnane X receptor (PXR) assay. In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1) with IC 50S of 1.2 and 0.79 \u03bcM, respectively."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of pazopanib was evaluated in CD-1 mice, and Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of pazopanib to mice for 2 years did not result in increased incidence of neoplasms at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Administration of pazopanib to rats for 2 years resulted in findings of duodenal adenocarcinoma in males at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) and in females at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). The human relevance of these neoplastic findings is unclear. Pazopanib did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. In an oral female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating, and for 6 days after mating. Pazopanib did affect fertility in female rats. Reduced fertility, including increased pre-implantation loss and early resorptions, were noted at dosages greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Decreased corpora lutea and increased cysts were noted in mice given greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks and ovarian atrophy was noted in rats given greater than or equal to 300 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks (approximately 1.3 and 0.85-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Decreased corpora lutea was also noted in monkeys given 500 mg/kg/day for up to 34 weeks (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Pazopanib did not affect mating or fertility in male rats. However, there were reductions in sperm production rates and testicular sperm concentrations at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day, epididymal sperm concentrations at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day, and sperm motility at greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day following 15 weeks of dosing. Following 15 and 26 weeks of dosing, there were decreased testicular and epididymal weights at doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.35-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day); atrophy and degeneration of the testes with aspermia, hypospermia, and cribiform change in the epididymis was also observed at this dose in the 6-month toxicity studies in male rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma The efficacy of pazopanib tablets was evaluated in VEG105192, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial ( NCT00387764 ). Patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who had received either no prior therapy or one prior cytokine-based systemic therapy were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily or placebo once daily. Eligible subjects were stratified according to the following 3 stratification factors: baseline ECOG performance status 0 versus 1; prior nephrectomy yes versus no; and prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC: treatment-na\u00efve versus one prior cytokine-based therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional outcome measures were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response. Of the total of 435 patients enrolled in this trial, 233 patients had no prior systemic therapy (treatment-na\u00efve subgroup) and 202 patients received one prior IL-2 or INF\u03b1-based therapy (cytokine-pretreated subgroup). The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the arms receiving pazopanib tablets and placebo. The majority of patients were male (71%) with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-six percent of patients were white, 14% were Asian, and < 1% were other. Forty-two percent were ECOG performance status 0 and 58% were ECOG performance status 1. All patients had clear cell histology (90%) or predominantly clear cell histology (10%). Approximately 50% of all patients had 3 or more organs involved with metastatic disease. The most common metastatic sites at baseline were lung (74%), lymph nodes (56%), bone (27%), and liver (25%). A similar proportion of patients in each arm were treatment-na\u00efve and cytokine-pretreated (see Table 8). In the cytokine-pretreated subgroup, the majority (75%) had received interferon-based treatment. Similar proportions of patients in each arm had prior nephrectomy (89% and 88% for pazopanib tablets and placebo, respectively). The analysis of the primary endpoint PFS was based on disease assessment by independent radiological review in the entire trial population. Efficacy results are presented in Table 8 and Figure 1.

The median OS for the placebo arm includes 79 patients (54%) who discontinued placebo treatment because of disease progression and crossed over to treatment with pazopanib tablets. In the placebo arm, 95 (66%) patients received at least one systemic anticancer treatment after progression compared with 88 (30%) patients randomized to pazopanib tablets. 14.2 Soft Tissue Sarcoma The efficacy of pazopanib tablets was evaluated in VEG110727, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial ( NCT00753688 ). Patients with metastatic STS who had received prior chemotherapy, including anthracycline treatment, or were unsuited for such therapy, were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily or placebo. Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) or adipocytic sarcoma were excluded from the trial. Randomization was stratified by the factors of WHO performance status (WHO PS) 0 or 1 at baseline and the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 versus 2+). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS assessed by independent radiological review. Additional outcome measures were OS, ORR, and duration of response. The majority of patients were female (59%) with a median age of 55 years. Seventy-two percent of patients were white, 22% were Asian, and 6% were other. Forty-three percent of patients had leiomyosarcoma, 10% had synovial sarcoma, and 47% had other soft tissue sarcomas. Fifty-six percent of patients had received 2 or more lines of prior systemic therapy and 44% had received 0 or 1 lines of prior systemic therapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 2. Table 9.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage : 800 mg orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). ( 2.1 ) Moderate Hepatic Impairment : 200 mg orally once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of VOTRIENT is 800 mg (four 200 mg tablets) orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The dosage should be modified for hepatic impairment and in patients taking certain concomitant drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] . Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush tablets due to the potential for increased rate of absorption, which may affect systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If a dose is missed, it should not be taken if it is < 12 hours until the next dose. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Table 1 summarizes the recommended dose reductions. Table 1. Recommended Dose Reductions of VOTRIENT for Adverse Reactions Dose reduction For renal cell carcinoma For soft tissue sarcoma First 400 mg orally once daily 600 mg orally once daily Second 200 mg orally once daily 400 mg orally once daily Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients unable to tolerate the second dose reduction. Table 2 summarizes the recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions. Table 2. Recommended Dosage Modifications of VOTRIENT for Adverse Reactions Abbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ULN, upper limit of normal. a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Adverse reaction Severity a Dosage modification Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Isolated ALT elevations between 3 \u00d7 ULN and 8 \u00d7 ULN Continue and monitor liver function weekly until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Isolated ALT elevations of > 8 \u00d7 ULN Withhold until improvement to Grade 1 or baseline. If the potential benefit for resuming treatment with VOTRIENT is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then resume at a reduced dose of no more than 400 mg once daily and measure serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks. Permanently discontinue if ALT elevations > 3 \u00d7 ULN recur despite dose reduction(s). ALT elevations > 3 \u00d7 ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations > 2 \u00d7 ULN Permanently discontinue and continue to monitor until resolution. Patients with only a mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, known as Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, and ALT elevations > 3 \u00d7 ULN should be managed per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations. Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Symptomatic or Grade 3 Withhold until improvement to Grade < 3. Resume treatment based on medical judgement. Grade 4 Permanently discontinue. Hemorrhagic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Grade 2 Withhold until improvement to Grade \u2264 1. Resume at reduced dose (see Table 1). Permanently discontinue if Grade 2 recurs after dose interruption and reduction. Grade 3 or 4 Permanently discontinue. Arterial Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Any grade Permanently discontinue.

Permanently discontinue if hypertension remains Grade 3 despite dose reduction(s) and adjustment of anti-hypertensive therapy. Grade 4 or hypertensive crisis Permanently discontinue. Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] 24-hour urine protein \u2265 3 grams Withhold until improvement to Grade \u2264 1. Resume at a reduced dose (see Table 1). Permanently discontinue if 24-hour urine protein \u2265 3 grams does not improve or recurs despite dose reductions. Confirmed nephrotic syndrome Permanently discontinue. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Hepatic Impairment Moderate and Severe Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment [total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and any alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value], consider alternatives to VOTRIENT. If VOTRIENT is used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reduce the VOTRIENT dose to 200 mg orally once daily. VOTRIENT is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors by use of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, reduce the dose of VOTRIENT to 400 mg [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers by use of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. VOTRIENT is not recommended in patients who cannot avoid chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant use of a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacid in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate short-acting antacid and VOTRIENT dosing by several hours [see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Toxicity : Severe and fatal hepatotoxicity has occurred. Monitor liver tests at baseline, regularly during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold VOTRIENT and resume at reduced dose with continued weekly monitoring for 8 weeks, or permanently discontinue with weekly monitoring until resolution based on severity of hepatotoxicity. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes : Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QT interval prolongation. Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes at baseline and as clinically indicated. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia prior to initiating VOTRIENT and during treatment. ( 5.2 , 12.2 ) Cardiac Dysfunction : Cardiac dysfunction, including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure, have occurred. Monitor blood pressure and manage as appropriate. Monitor for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Conduct baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold or permanently discontinue VOTRIENT based on severity of cardiac dysfunction. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Hemorrhagic Events : Fatal hemorrhagic events have occurred. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. Withhold VOTRIENT and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of hemorrhagic events. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Arterial Thromboembolic Events : Arterial thromboembolic events have been observed and can be fatal. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in case of an arterial thromboembolic event. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Venous Thromboembolic Events : Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been observed, including fatal pulmonary emboli (PE). Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold VOTRIENT and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE. ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Thrombotic Microangiopathy : Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), has been observed. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT if TMA occurs. ( 2.2 , 5.7 ) Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula : Fatal perforation events have occurred. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Withhold VOTRIENT in case of Grade 2 or 3 gastrointestinal fistula and resume based on medical judgement. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in case of gastrointestinal perforation or Grade 4 gastrointestinal fistula. ( 2.2 , 5.8 ) Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis : Can be fatal. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients who develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis. ( 2.2 , 5.9 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome : Can be fatal. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients who develop posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). ( 2.2 , 5.10 ) Hypertension : Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been observed. Do not initiate VOTRIENT in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating VOTRIENT. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated and initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold and then dose reduce VOTRIENT or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension. ( 2.2 , 5.11 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing : Withhold VOTRIENT for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of VOTRIENT after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.12 ) Hypothyroidism : Monitor thyroid tests at baseline, during treatment and as clinically indicated and manage hypothyroidism as appropriate. ( 5.13 ) Proteinuria : Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold VOTRIENT then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome. ( 2.2 , 5.14 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (some fatal) have been reported in patients with RCC and STS. Closely monitor patients at risk and treat as clinically indicated. ( 5.15 ) Infection : Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly. Consider interruption or discontinuation of VOTRIENT. ( 5.16 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and patients to use effective contraception. ( 5.19 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hepatic Toxicity Hepatotoxicity, manifested as increases in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin, occurred in patients who received VOTRIENT. This hepatotoxicity can be severe and fatal. Patients older than 65 years are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Transaminase elevations occur early in the course of treatment; 92% of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first 18 weeks. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 18% and ALT > 10 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4% of the 290 patients who received VOTRIENT. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2%. In the monotherapy trials, 2 patients died with disease progression and hepatic failure. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 18% and ALT > 8 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 5% of the 240 patients who received VOTRIENT. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN and bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2%. One patient died of hepatic failure. Monitor liver tests at baseline; at Weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9; at Month 3 and Month 4; and then periodically as clinically indicated. Increase to weekly monitoring for patients with elevated ALT until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Withhold VOTRIENT and resume at reduced dose with continued weekly monitoring for 8 weeks, or permanently discontinue with weekly monitoring until resolution based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Gilbert\u2019s Syndrome VOTRIENT is a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert\u2019s syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . In patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia known as Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, manage elevation in ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Concomitant Use of Simvastatin Concomitant use of VOTRIENT and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and VOTRIENT. 5.2 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes In the RCC trials, 558/586 patients were subject to routine electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and QT prolongation \u2265 500 msec was identified in 2% of these 558 patients. In monotherapy trials, torsades de pointes occurred in < 1% of 977 patients who received VOTRIENT. In the randomized RCC (VEG105192) and STS (VEG110727) trials, 1% (3/290) and 0.4% (1/240) of patients, respectively, who received VOTRIENT had post-baseline values between 500 to 549 msec. Post-baseline QT data were only collected in the STS trial if ECG abnormalities were reported as an adverse reaction. Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and those with relevant preexisting cardiac disease [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Monitor ECG and electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) at baseline and as clinically indicated. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia prior to initiating VOTRIENT and during treatment. 5.3 Cardiac Dysfunction Cardiac dysfunction, including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure, occurred in patients who received VOTRIENT. In the RCC trials, cardiac dysfunction was observed in 0.6% of 586 patients without routine on-study LVEF monitoring. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), myocardial dysfunction was defined as symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or \u2265 15% absolute decline in LVEF compared with baseline or a decline in LVEF of \u2265 10% compared with baseline that is also below the lower limit of normal. In an RCC trial (COMPARZ), myocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% of the 362 patients on VOTRIENT who had a baseline and post-baseline LVEF measurements. Congestive heart failure occurred in 0.5% of patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), myocardial dysfunction occurred in 11% of the 142 patients who had a baseline and a post-baseline LVEF measurements. One percent (3/240) of patients who received VOTRIENT had congestive heart failure, which did not resolve in one patient. Fourteen of the 16 patients with myocardial dysfunction treated with VOTRIENT had concurrent hypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk (e.g., those with prior anthracycline therapy) possibly by increasing cardiac afterload. Monitor blood pressure and manage as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] . Monitor for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Conduct baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction, including previous anthracycline exposure. Withhold or permanently discontinue VOTRIENT based on severity of cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.4 Hemorrhagic Events In the RCC trials, fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.9% of 586 patients, and cerebral/intracranial hemorrhage was observed in < 1% (2/586) of patients treated with VOTRIENT. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), 13% of 290 patients treated with VOTRIENT experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were hematuria (4%), epistaxis (2%), hemoptysis (2%), and rectal hemorrhage (1%). Nine of 37 patients treated with VOTRIENT who had hemorrhagic events experienced serious events, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary hemorrhage. One percent of patients treated with VOTRIENT died from hemorrhage. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), 22% of 240 patients treated with VOTRIENT experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (8%), mouth hemorrhage (3%), and anal hemorrhage (2%). Grade 4 hemorrhagic events occurred in 1% of patients and included intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and peritoneal hemorrhage. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. Withhold VOTRIENT and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of hemorrhagic events [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.5 Arterial Thromboembolic Events In the RCC trials, fatal arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 0.3% of 586 patients. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), 2% of 290 patients who received VOTRIENT experienced myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.3% had a cerebrovascular accident, and 1% had an event of transient ischemic attack. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), 2% of 240 patients who received VOTRIENT experienced a myocardial infarction or ischemia and 0.4% had a cerebrovascular accident. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in case of an arterial thromboembolic event [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.6 Venous Thromboembolic Events Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), including venous thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolus (PE), occurred in patients who received VOTRIENT. In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), VTEs occurred in 1% of 290 patients who received VOTRIENT. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), VTEs were reported in 5% of 240 patients who received VOTRIENT. Fatal PE occurred in 1% (2/240). Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold VOTRIENT and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), occurred in clinical trials of VOTRIENT as monotherapy, in combination with bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Six of the 7 TMA cases occurred within 90 days of the initiation of VOTRIENT. Improvement of TMA was observed after treatment was discontinued. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TMA. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing TMA. Manage as clinically indicated. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula In the RCC and STS trials, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.9% of 586 patients and 1% of 382 patients who received VOTRIENT, respectively. Fatal perforations occurred in 0.3% (2/586) of these patients in the RCC trials and in 0.3% (1/382) of these patients in the STS trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Withhold VOTRIENT in case of Grade 2 or 3 gastrointestinal fistula and resume based on medical judgement. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in case of gastrointestinal perforation or Grade 4 gastrointestinal fistula [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.9 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, has been reported with VOTRIENT across clinical trials. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with VOTRIENT. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients who develop ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients who received VOTRIENT and may be fatal. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Confirm diagnosis of PRES by magnetic resonance imaging. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients who develop PRES. 5.11 Hypertension Hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 100 mmHg) and hypertensive crisis were observed in patients treated with VOTRIENT. Approximately 40% of patients who received VOTRIENT experienced hypertension, with Grade 3 occurring in 4% to 7% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . About 40% of cases occurred by Day 9 and about 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks across clinical trials. Approximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of VOTRIENT because of hypertension. Do not initiate VOTRIENT in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating VOTRIENT. Monitor blood pressure as clinically indicated and initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold and then dose reduce VOTRIENT or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.12 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing complications can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, VOTRIENT has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold VOTRIENT at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of VOTRIENT after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.13 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism, confirmed based on a simultaneous rise of TSH and decline of T4, occurred in 7% of 290 patients who received VOTRIENT in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and in 5% of 240 patients who received VOTRIENT in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727). Hypothyroidism occurred in 4% of the 586 patients in the RCC trials and 5% of the 382 patients in the STS trials. Monitor thyroid tests at baseline, during treatment and as clinically indicated and manage hypothyroidism as appropriate. 5.14 Proteinuria In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), proteinuria occurred in 9% of 290 patients who received VOTRIENT. In 2 patients, proteinuria led to discontinuation of VOTRIENT. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), proteinuria occurred in 1% of 240 patients and nephrotic syndrome occurred in 1 patient. Treatment was discontinued in the patient with nephrotic syndrome. Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold VOTRIENT then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.15 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal cases, have been reported in RCC and STS patients treated with VOTRIENT [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis, and treat as clinically indicated. 5.16 Infection Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), including some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of VOTRIENT for serious infections. 5.17 Increased Toxicity With Other Cancer Therapy VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Clinical trials of VOTRIENT in combination with pemetrexed and lapatinib were terminated early due to increased toxicity and mortality. The fatal toxicities observed included pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death. A safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens. 5.18 Increased Toxicity in Developing Organs The safety and effectiveness of VOTRIENT in pediatric patients have not been established. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation in patients younger than 2 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 5.19 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, VOTRIENT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of VOTRIENT to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mg (based on area under the curve [AUC]). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VOTRIENT and for at least 2 weeks following the final dose. Advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with VOTRIENT and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] ."

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure of 977 patients who received VOTRIENT as a single agent, including 586 VOTRIENT-treated patients with RCC. With a median duration of treatment of 7.4 months (range, 0.1 to 27.6) in these 977 patients, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 586 patients were diarrhea, hypertension, hair color change, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, and vomiting. The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS also reflects exposure of 382 patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received VOTRIENT as a single agent, with a median duration of treatment of 3.6 months (range, 0 to 53). The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 382 patients were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased weight, hypertension, decreased appetite, vomiting, tumor pain, hair color changes, musculoskeletal pain, headache, dysgeusia, dyspnea, and skin hypopigmentation. Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of VOTRIENT was evaluated in 290 patients with RCC who participated in VEG105192, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The median duration of treatment was 7.4 months (range, 0 to 23) for patients who received VOTRIENT. Forty-two percent of patients on VOTRIENT required a dose interruption and 36% required a dose reduction. Table 3 presents adverse reactions in VEG105192. Table 3.

Elevated lipase as an adverse reaction was reported for 4% of 225 patients, including 2.7% (6/225) with Grade 3 and 0.4% (1/225) with Grade 4. In the RCC trials, clinical pancreatitis was observed in < 1% of 586 patients. Pneumothorax Two of 290 patients (0.7%) treated with VOTRIENT in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and 8 of 240 patients (3.3%) treated with VOTRIENT in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727) developed a pneumothorax. Bradycardia In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 280 patients treated with VOTRIENT. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 290 patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 238 patients treated with VOTRIENT. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 240 patients. Adverse Reactions in East Asian Patients In an analysis of pooled clinical trial data (N = 1938) with VOTRIENT, Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia (12% versus 2%), thrombocytopenia (6% versus < 1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (6% versus 2%) were observed more frequently in patients of East Asian descent than in patients of non-East Asian descent. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VOTRIENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Polycythemia Eye Disorders : Retinal detachment/tear Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis Metabolic and Nutrition Disorder : Tumor lysis syndrome (including fatal cases) Vascular Disorders : Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture (including fatal cases)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration of VOTRIENT with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of VOTRIENT. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. VOTRIENT is not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) CYP Substrates : Coadministration of VOTRIENT with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended. ( 7.2 ) Concomitant Use With Simvastatin : Concomitant use of VOTRIENT with simvastatin increases the risk of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations. Increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold VOTRIENT and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity. ( 7.3 ) Concomitant Use With Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents : Avoid concomitant use of VOTRIENT with gastric acid-reducing agents. Consider short-acting antacids in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours. ( 2.4 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on VOTRIENT Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 increases pazopanib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid coadministration of VOTRIENT with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of VOTRIENT [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. VOTRIENT is not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Transporters Coadministration of strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase pazopanib concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of VOTRIENT with strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Consider selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP. 7.2 Effects of VOTRIENT on Other Drugs CYP Substrates Coadministration of VOTRIENT with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 may result in inhibition of the metabolism of these products and create the potential for serious adverse reactions. The concomitant use of VOTRIENT with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Concomitant Use With Simvastatin Concomitant use of VOTRIENT with simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. Across clinical trials of VOTRIENT as a single agent, ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN was reported in 126/895 (14%) of patients who did not use statins compared with 11/41 (27%) of patients who had concomitant use of simvastatin. If a patient receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold VOTRIENT and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and VOTRIENT. 7.4 Concomitant Use With Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Concomitant use of VOTRIENT with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib. Avoid concomitant use of VOTRIENT with gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant administration with a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate short-acting antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours to avoid a reduction in pazopanib exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.5 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval VOTRIENT is associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Avoid coadministration of VOTRIENT with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , VOTRIENT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on VOTRIENT use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, oral administration of pazopanib to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity, and abortion at systemic exposures lower than that observed at the MRHD of 800 mg/day (based on AUC) ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects in clinically recognized pregnancies and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered oral pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating and for 6 days after mating, which resulted in increased pre-implantation loss and early resorptions at dosages greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Total litter resorption was seen at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Postimplantation loss, embryolethality, and decreased fetal body weights were noted in females administered doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral pazopanib was administered to pregnant animals during organogenesis. In rats, dose levels of greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) resulted in teratogenic effects, including cardiovascular malformations (retroesophageal subclavian artery, missing innominate artery, changes in the aortic arch), incomplete or absent ossification, increases in postimplantation loss, embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight. In rabbits, maternal toxicity, increased postimplantation loss and abortion were observed at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). In addition, severe maternal body weight loss and 100% litter loss were observed at doses greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day (0.02-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day), while fetal weight was reduced at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (AUC not calculated). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of pazopanib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with VOTRIENT and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential VOTRIENT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with VOTRIENT. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VOTRIENT and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Males Advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with VOTRIENT and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Based on findings from animal studies, VOTRIENT may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential while receiving treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VOTRIENT in pediatric patients have not been established. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)] . Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation during early postnatal development. Administration of pazopanib to juvenile rats < 21 days old resulted in toxicity to the lungs, liver, heart, and kidney and in death at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose or doses tolerated in older animals (see Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data) . The safety and efficacy of VOTRIENT or an unapproved pazopanib formulation were investigated but not established in two open-label studies: a study in 37 pediatric patients 2 to < 17 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumors [NCT00929903] and a study in 46 pediatric patients 1 year to < 17 years with refractory solid tumors, including sarcoma [NCT01956669]. Meaningful anti-tumor activity was not observed in these studies. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In rats, weaning occurs at Day 21 postpartum which approximately equates to a human pediatric age of 2 years. In a juvenile animal toxicology study performed in rats, when animals were dosed from Day 9 through Day 14 postpartum (pre-weaning), pazopanib caused abnormal organ growth/maturation in the kidney, lung, liver, and heart at approximately 0.1-fold the AUC in adults at the MRHD of 800 mg/day of VOTRIENT. At approximately 0.4-fold the AUC in adults at the MRHD of 800 mg/day, pazopanib administration resulted in mortality. In repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats, including 4-week, 13-week, and 26-week administration, toxicities in bone, teeth, and nail beds were observed at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.07-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Doses of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) were not tolerated in 13- and 26-week studies and animals required dose reductions due to body weight loss and morbidity. Hypertrophy of epiphyseal growth plates, nail abnormalities (including broken, overgrown, or absent nails) and tooth abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (including excessively long, brittle, broken, and missing teeth, and dentine and enamel degeneration and thinning) were observed in rats at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.35-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) at 26 weeks, with the onset of tooth and nail bed alterations noted clinically after 4 to 6 weeks. Similar findings were noted in repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats dosed with pazopanib beginning Day 21 postpartum (post-weaning). In the post-weaning animals, the occurrence of changes in teeth and bones occurred earlier and with greater severity than in older animals. There was evidence of tooth degeneration and decreased bone growth at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.1- to 0.2-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). Pazopanib exposure in juvenile rats was lower than that seen at the same dose levels in adult animals, based on comparative AUC values. At pazopanib doses approximately 0.5- to 0.7-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day, decreased bone growth in juvenile rats persisted even after the end of the dosing period. Finally, despite lower pazopanib exposures than those reported in adult animals or adult humans, juvenile animals administered 300 mg/kg/dose pazopanib required dose reduction within 4 weeks of dosing initiation due to significant toxicity, although adult animals could tolerate this same dose for at least 3 times as long [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use In pooled clinical trials with VOTRIENT, 30% of 2080 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. More patients \u2265 65 years had ALT elevations > 3 \u00d7 ULN compared to patients < 65 years (23% versus 18%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In the RCC trials, 33% of 586 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of VOTRIENT were observed between these patients and younger patients. In the STS trials, 24% of 382 patients were aged \u2265 65 years. Patients aged \u2265 65 years had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 fatigue (19% versus 12% for patients aged < 65 years), hypertension (10% versus 6%), decreased appetite (11% versus 2%), ALT elevations (3% versus 2%) and AST elevations (4% versus 1%). In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), no overall differences in effectiveness of VOTRIENT were observed between patients aged \u2265 65 years and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (either total bilirubin \u2264 ULN and ALT > ULN or bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value). VOTRIENT is not recommended in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) and severe (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any ALT value) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and -3, cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin-2 receptor-inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro, pazopanib inhibited ligand-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Kit, and PDGFR-\u03b2 receptors. In vivo, pazopanib inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in a mouse model, and the growth of some human tumor xenografts in mice. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increases in blood pressure have been observed and are related to steady-state trough plasma pazopanib concentrations. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT prolongation potential of pazopanib was assessed in a randomized, blinded, parallel trial (N = 96) using moxifloxacin as a positive control. VOTRIENT 800 mg orally under fasting conditions was administered on Days 2 to 8 and 1,600 mg was administered on Day 9 after a meal in order to increase exposure to pazopanib and its metabolites. No large changes (i.e., > 20 msec) in QTc interval following exposure to pazopanib were detected in this QT trial. The trial was not able to exclude small changes (< 10 msec) in QTc interval, because assay sensitivity below this threshold (< 10 msec) was not established in this trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The recommended dosage of 800 mg once daily results in mean AUC of 1,037 mcg\u2022h/mL and C max of 58.1 mcg/mL. There was no consistent increase in AUC or C max at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. Administration of a single 400-mg crushed tablet increased AUC 0-72h by 46% and C max by approximately 2-fold and decreased T max by approximately 2 hours compared with administration of the whole tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Absorption The median time to achieve peak concentrations was 2 to 4 hours after a dose. Effect of Food Systemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat (approximately 50% fat) or low-fat (approximately 5% fat) meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and C max . Distribution Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was > 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Elimination Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 31 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Metabolism In vitro studies demonstrated that pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Excretion Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for < 4% of the administered dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Table 7 presents a comparison of the median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h values for patients with normal, mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The median steady-state of pazopanib C max and AUC 0-24h after a once-daily dose of 800 mg in patients with mild impairment were in a similar range as the median steady-state C max and median AUC 0-24h in patients with no hepatic impairment. The maximum tolerated pazopanib dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was 200 mg once daily. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h were approximately 43% and 29%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment. The median steady-state C max and the median AUC 0-24h were approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with no hepatic impairment.

Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitor : Coadministration of 1,500 mg lapatinib, a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP, with VOTRIENT 800 mg resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase in mean pazopanib AUC 0-24h and C max . CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 Substrates : Clinical studies, using VOTRIENT 800 mg once daily, have demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in patients with cancer. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 Substrates : Coadministration of VOTRIENT resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Coadministration of VOTRIENT 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and C max , respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents : Coadministration of VOTRIENT with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and C max ) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.4)] . In Vitro Studies In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited the activities of CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an in vitro human pregnane X receptor (PXR) assay. In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1) with IC 50 s of 1.2 and 0.79 \u03bcM, respectively. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Pazopanib can increase serum total bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In vitro studies showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1, which glucuronidates bilirubin for elimination. A pooled pharmacogenetic analysis of 236 white patients who received VOTRIENT showed that the (TA)7/(TA)7 genotype (UGT1A1*28/*28) (underlying genetic susceptibility to Gilbert\u2019s syndrome) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia relative to the (TA)6/(TA)6 and (TA)6/(TA)7 genotypes. In a pooled pharmacogenetic analysis of data from 31 clinical studies of pazopanib administered as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents, ALT > 3 \u00d7 ULN (Grade 2) occurred in 32% (42/133) of HLA-B*57:01 allele carriers and in 19% (397/2101) of non-carriers and ALT > 5 \u00d7 ULN (Grade 3) occurred in 19% (25/133) of HLA-B*57:01 allele carriers and in 10% (213/2101) of non-carriers. In this dataset, 6% (133/2234) of the patients carried the HLA-B*57:01 allele [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] ."

Administration of pazopanib to rats for 2 years resulted in findings of duodenal adenocarcinoma in males at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day) and in females at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3-fold the AUC at the MRHD of 800 mg/day). The human relevance of these neoplastic findings is unclear. Pazopanib did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. In an oral female fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats were administered pazopanib at least 15 days prior to mating, and for 6 days after mating.

Kaplan-Meier Curve for Progression-free Survival in STS by Independent Assessment for the Overall Population in VEG110727 14.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma The efficacy of VOTRIENT was evaluated in VEG105192, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (NCT00387764). Patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who had received either no prior therapy or one prior cytokine-based systemic therapy were randomized (2:1) to receive VOTRIENT 800 mg once daily or placebo once daily. Eligible subjects were stratified according to the following 3 stratification factors: baseline ECOG performance status 0 versus 1; prior nephrectomy yes versus no; and prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC: treatment-na\u00efve versus one prior cytokine-based therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional outcome measures were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response. Of the total of 435 patients enrolled in this trial, 233 patients had no prior systemic therapy (treatment-na\u00efve subgroup) and 202 patients received one prior IL-2 or INF\u03b1-based therapy (cytokine-pretreated subgroup). The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the arms receiving VOTRIENT and placebo. The majority of patients were male (71%) with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-six percent of patients were white, 14% were Asian, and < 1% were other. Forty-two percent were ECOG performance status 0 and 58% were ECOG performance status 1. All patients had clear cell histology (90%) or predominantly clear cell histology (10%). Approximately 50% of all patients had 3 or more organs involved with metastatic disease. The most common metastatic sites at baseline were lung (74%), lymph nodes (56%), bone (27%), and liver (25%). A similar proportion of patients in each arm were treatment-na\u00efve and cytokine-pretreated (see Table 8). In the cytokine-pretreated subgroup, the majority (75%) had received interferon-based treatment. Similar proportions of patients in each arm had prior nephrectomy (89% and 88% for VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively). The analysis of the primary endpoint PFS was based on disease assessment by independent radiological review in the entire trial population. Efficacy results are presented in Table 8 and Figure 1.

The median OS for the placebo arm includes 79 patients (54%) who discontinued placebo treatment because of disease progression and crossed over to treatment with VOTRIENT. In the placebo arm, 95 (66%) patients received at least one systemic anticancer treatment after progression compared with 88 (30%) patients randomized to VOTRIENT. 14.2 Soft Tissue Sarcoma The efficacy of VOTRIENT was evaluated in VEG110727, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (NCT00753688). Patients with metastatic STS who had received prior chemotherapy, including anthracycline treatment, or were unsuited for such therapy, were randomized (2:1) to receive VOTRIENT 800 mg once daily or placebo. Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) or adipocytic sarcoma were excluded from the trial. Randomization was stratified by the factors of WHO performance status (WHO PS) 0 or 1 at baseline and the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 versus 2+). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS assessed by independent radiological review. Additional outcome measures were OS, ORR, and duration of response. The majority of patients were female (59%) with a median age of 55 years. Seventy-two percent of patients were white, 22% were Asian, and 6% were other. Forty-three percent of patients had leiomyosarcoma, 10% had synovial sarcoma, and 47% had other soft tissue sarcomas. Fifty-six percent of patients had received 2 or more lines of prior systemic therapy and 44% had received 0 or 1 lines of prior systemic therapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 2. Table 9.
