      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis, Anaphylactic Shock and Other Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions : Contains sodium metabisulfite. Serious reactions may occur during or soon after administration. If symptoms occur, discontinue the drug. (4, 5.1) Evacuation of Gallstones : Stimulation of gallbladder contraction in patients with small gallbladder stones could lead to the evacuation of the stones from the gallbladder, resulting in their lodging in the cystic duct or in the common bile duct. (5.2) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions with Intravenous Injection : Administration as an intravenous injection may cause transient nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness or flushing. To reduce the risk of adverse reactions when used to simulate contraction of the gallbladder or accelerate transit of a barium meal through the small intestine, administer as an intravenous infusion over 50 or 30 minutes, respectively. (2.1, 5.3) Preterm Labor or Spontaneous Abortion : Advise pregnant women of the potential risk for preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Anaphylaxis, Anaphylactic Shock and Other Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Contains sodium metabisulfite \u200b[see Description (11)], \u200b a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and other serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during and within one hour following administration of sincalide [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Sincalide for Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfites. Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when Sincalide for Injection is administered. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Observe patients closely during and after the infusion. Do not reinitiate Sincalide for Injection in patients who have experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Evacuation of Gallstones Stimulation of gallbladder contraction in patients with small gallbladder stones could lead to the evacuation of the stones from the gallbladder, resulting in their lodging in the cystic duct or in the common bile duct. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions with Intravenous Injection Administration of Sincalide for Injection as an intravenous injection may cause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness, and flushing [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . These reactions are generally transient. To reduce the risk of adverse reactions with intravenous injection when used to simulate contraction of the gallbladder or accelerate transit of a barium meal through the small intestine, administer Sincalide for Injection as an intravenous infusion over 50 or 30 minutes, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.4 Preterm Labor or Spontaneous Abortion Based on limited human data and mechanism of action, advise pregnant patients that Sincalide for Injection may cause preterm labor or spontaneous abortion [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency, reliably, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent adverse reactions (20% or greater) are gastrointestinal: abdominal discomfort or pain, and nausea; these may not necessarily indicate an abnormality of the biliary tract unless there is other clinical or radiologic evidence of disease. Less common adverse reactions include: Hypersensitivity reactions : anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, hypotension, throat tightness, bradycardia, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal cramping, diaphoresis, hives, rash, itching; and numbness of face, lips and eyes [see Contraindications (4)] . Neurological reactions : seizures, headache. Vasovagal reactions : dizziness, loss of consciousness, nausea, diaphoresis, syncope and hypotension (generally self-limiting). Other : nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypertension, urge to defecate, diarrhea, sneezing. Most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are: abdominal discomfort or pain, and nausea.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on limited human data and mechanism of action, Sincalide for Injection may cause preterm labor or spontaneous abortion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Limited available data with Sincalide for Injection are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal embryo-fetal development studies in which sincalide was administered to hamsters and rats during the period of organogenesis, no effects were seen at doses comparable to the maximum recommended clinical dose on a mg/kg basis. However, in a prenatal development study in which rats were administered sincalide during organogenesis through parturition, decreased weight gain and developmental delays were observed at a dose 122 times higher than the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data There were no effects on embryo-fetal development in hamsters when sincalide was administered subcutaneously at 250 or 750 ng/kg during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 13) at doses up to 0.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 120 ng/kg on a body surface area basis. No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in Sprague-Dawley rats at subcutaneous doses of 250, 450, or 750 ng/kg from Gestation Days 6 to16, representing 1.0 time the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. In a separate study at a higher dose of 90 mcg/kg administered subcutaneously to CFY rats from Gestation Day 10 through parturition (representing 122 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), offspring showed decreased growth, behavioral changes, and developmental delays. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of sincalide in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Sincalide for Injection and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from Sincalide for Injection or from the underlying condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Animal Data Direct injection of sincalide in neonatal rats reduced milk consumption with the youngest rats exhibiting the greatest sensitivity to this effect. Although safety margins relative to maternal doses cannot be calculated since rat pups were injected directly, the safety margin in the youngest rat pups was less than 0.1 on a body surface area bases compared to the maximum adult clinical dose. At higher doses administered subcutaneously in neonatal rats, transient behavioral changes and small effects on physical developmental milestones such as ear opening, eye opening, and incisor appearance were observed (at doses 10 to 200-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sincalide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

Overdosage symptoms should be treated symptomatically and should be of short duration. A single bolus intravenous injection of 0.05 mcg/kg (approximately 2 to 3 times the human dose of 0.02 mcg/kg), sincalide caused hypotension and bradycardia in dogs. In addition, higher doses injected intravenously once or repeatedly in dogs caused syncope and ECG changes (approximately 5 times the human dose of 0.02 mcg/kg). These effects were attributed to sincalide-induced vagal stimulation in that all were prevented by pretreatment with atropine or bilateral vagotomy."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Sincalide for Injection is a cholecystopancreatic-gastrointestinal hormone for parenteral administration. The agent is a synthetically-prepared C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin. Each single-dose vial of sincalide provides a sterile nonpyrogenic lyophilized white to off-white cake or powder consisting of 5 mcg sincalide with 30 mg arginine hydrochloride, 15 mg lysine hydrochloride,170 mg mannitol, 4 mg methionine, 2 mg pentetic acid, and 0.04 mg sodium metabisulfite. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide prior to lyophilization. Sincalide is designated chemically as L-\u03b1-aspartyl-O- sulfo-L-tyrosyl-L-methionylglycyl-L-tryptophyl-L-methionyl- L-\u03b1-aspartyl-L-phenylalaninamide. Graphic formula: sincalide-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action When injected intravenously, Sincalide stimulates gallbladder contraction and reduction in size. The evacuation of bile that results is similar to that which occurs physiologically in response to endogenous cholecystokinin. Sincalide also stimulates pancreatic secretion and intestinal motility causing pyloric contraction and slows gastric emptying. Concurrent administration of sincalide with secretin increases both the volume of pancreatic secretion and the output of bicarbonate and enzymes. This combined effect of secretin and sincalide permits the assessment of specific pancreatic function through measurement and analysis of the duodenal aspirate. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following an intravenous (bolus) injection of 0.02 mcg/kg sincalide, maximal contraction of the gallbladder occurred in 5 to 15 minutes. Sincalide reduced gallbladder radiographic size by at least 40%, which is generally considered satisfactory contraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis, Anaphylactic Shock and Other Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Contains sodium metabisulfite. Serious reactions may occur during or soon after administration. If symptoms occur, discontinue the drug. ( 4 , 5.1 ) Evacuation of Gallstones : Stimulation of gallbladder contraction in patients with small gallbladder stones could lead to the evacuation of the stones from the gallbladder, resulting in their lodging in the cystic duct or in the common bile duct. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions with Intravenous Injection : Administration as an intravenous injection may cause transient nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness or flushing. To reduce the risk of adverse reactions when used to stimulate contraction of the gallbladder or accelerate transit of a barium meal through the small intestine, administer as an intravenous infusion over 50 or 30 minutes, respectively. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Preterm Labor or Spontaneous Abortion : Advise pregnant women of the potential risk for preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Anaphylaxis, Anaphylactic Shock and Other Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Contains sodium metabisulfite [see Description ( 11 )] , a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and other serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during and within one hour following administration of Sincalide for Injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Sincalide for Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfites. Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when Sincalide for Injection is administered. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Observe patients closely during and after the infusion. Do not reinitiate Sincalide for Injection in patients who have experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.2 Evacuation of Gallstones Stimulation of gallbladder contraction in patients with small gallbladder stones could lead to the evacuation of the stones from the gallbladder, resulting in their lodging in the cystic duct or in the common bile duct. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions with Intravenous Injection Administration of Sincalide for Injection as an intravenous injection may cause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness, and flushing [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . These reactions are generally transient. To reduce the risk of adverse reactions with intravenous injection when used to stimulate contraction of the gallbladder or accelerate transit of a barium meal through the small intestine, administer Sincalide for Injection as an intravenous infusion over 50 or 30 minutes, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5.4 Preterm Labor or Spontaneous Abortion Because of Sincalide for Injection's effect on smooth muscle, pregnant patients should be advised that spontaneous abortion or premature induction of labor may occur [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency, reliably, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent adverse reactions (20% or greater) are gastrointestinal: abdominal discomfort or pain, and nausea; these may not necessarily indicate an abnormality of the biliary tract unless there is other clinical or radiologic evidence of disease. Less common adverse reactions include: Hypersensitivity reactions : anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, hypotension, throat tightness, bradycardia, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal cramping, diaphoresis, hives, rash, itching; and numbness of face, lips and eyes [see Contraindications ( 4 ), ( 5.1 )] . Neurological reactions : seizures, headache. Vasovagal reactions : dizziness, loss of consciousness, nausea, diaphoresis, syncope and hypotension (generally self-limiting). Other: nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypertension, urge to defecate, diarrhea, sneezing. Most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are: abdominal discomfort or pain, and nausea.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on limited human data and mechanism of action, sincalide may cause preterm labor or spontaneous abortion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Available data with Sincalide for Injection are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal embryo-fetal development studies in which sincalide was administered to hamsters and rats during the period of organogenesis, no effects were seen at doses comparable to the maximum recommended clinical dose on a mg/kg basis. However, in a prenatal development study in which rats were administered sincalide during organogenesis through parturition, decreased weight gain and developmental delays were observed at a dose 122 times higher than the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data There were no effects on embryo-fetal development in hamsters when sincalide was administered subcutaneously at 250 or 750 ng/kg during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 13) at doses up to 0.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 120 ng/kg on a body surface area basis. No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in Sprague-Dawley rats at subcutaneous doses of 250, 450, or 750 ng/kg from Gestation Days 6 to16, representing 1.0 time the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. In a separate study at a higher dose of 90 mcg/kg administered subcutaneously to CFY rats from Gestation Day 10 through parturition (representing 122 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), offspring showed decreased growth, behavioral changes, and developmental delays. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of sincalide in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Sincalide for Injection and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from Sincalide for Injection or from the underlying condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Sincalide for Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

Overdosage symptoms should be treated symptomatically and should be of short duration. A single bolus intravenous injection of 0.05 mcg/kg (approximately 2 to 3 times the human dose of 0.02 mcg/kg), sincalide caused hypotension and bradycardia in dogs. In addition, higher doses injected intravenously once or repeatedly in dogs caused syncope and ECG changes (approximately 5 times the human dose of 0.02 mcg/kg). These effects were attributed to sincalide-induced vagal stimulation in that all were prevented by pretreatment with atropine or bilateral vagotomy."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Sincalide for Injection is a cholecystopancreatic-gastrointestinal hormone for parenteral administration. The agent is a synthetically-prepared C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin. Each single-dose vial of sincalide provides a sterile nonpyrogenic lyophilized white powder consisting of 5 mcg sincalide with 30 mg arginine hydrochloride, 15 mg lysine hydrochloride, 170 mg mannitol, 4 mg methionine, 2 mg pentetic acid, 0.005 mcg polysorbate 20, 9 mg potassium phosphate dibasic, and 0.04 mg sodium metabisulfite. The pH is adjusted to 6.0 to 8.0 with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide prior to lyophilization. Sincalide is designated chemically as L-\u03b1-aspartyl-O-sulfo-L-tyrosyl-L-methionylglycyl-L-tryptophyl-L-methionyl- L-\u03b1-aspartyl-L-phenylalaninamide. Graphic formula: structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action When injected intravenously, sincalide stimulates gallbladder contraction and reduction in size. The evacuation of bile that results is similar to that which occurs physiologically in response to endogenous cholecystokinin. Sincalide also stimulates pancreatic secretion and intestinal motility causing pyloric contraction and slows gastric emptying. Concurrent administration of sincalide with secretin increases both the volume of pancreatic secretion and the out-put of bicarbonate and enzymes. This combined effect of secretin and sincalide permits the assessment of specific pancreatic function through measurement and analysis of the duodenal aspirate. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following an intravenous (bolus) injection of 0.02 mcg/kg of sincalide, maximal contraction of the gallbladder occurred in 5 to 15 minutes. Sincalide reduced gallbladder radiographic size by at least 40%, which is generally considered satisfactory contraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis, Anaphylactic Shock and Other Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions : Contains sodium metabisulfite. Serious reactions may occur during or soon after administration. If symptoms occur, discontinue the drug. ( 4 , 5.1 ) Evacuation of Gallstones : Stimulation of gallbladder contraction in patients with small gallbladder stones could lead to the evacuation of the stones from the gallbladder, resulting in their lodging in the cystic duct or in the common bile duct. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions with Intravenous Injection : Administration as an intravenous injection may cause transient nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness or flushing. To reduce the risk of adverse reactions when used to simulate contraction of the gallbladder or accelerate transit of a barium meal through the small intestine, administer as an intravenous infusion over 50 or 30 minutes, respectively. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Preterm Labor or Spontaneous Abortion : Advise pregnant women of the potential risk for preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Anaphylaxis, Anaphylactic Shock and Other Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Contains sodium metabisulfite [see Description (11)] , a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and other serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during and within one hour following administration of sincalide [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Sincalide for Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfites. Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when Sincalide for Injection is administered. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Observe patients closely during and after the infusion. Do not reinitiate Sincalide for Injection in patients who have experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Evacuation of Gallstones Stimulation of gallbladder contraction in patients with small gallbladder stones could lead to the evacuation of the stones from the gallbladder, resulting in their lodging in the cystic duct or in the common bile duct. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions with Intravenous Injection Administration of Sincalide for Injection as an intravenous injection may cause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, dizziness, and flushing [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . These reactions are generally transient. To reduce the risk of adverse reactions with intravenous injection when used to simulate contraction of the gallbladder or accelerate transit of a barium meal through the small intestine, administer Sincalide for Injection as an intravenous infusion over 50 or 30 minutes, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.4 Preterm Labor or Spontaneous Abortion Based on limited human data and mechanism of action, advise pregnant patients that Sincalide for Injection may cause preterm labor or spontaneous abortion [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency, reliably, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent adverse reactions (20% or greater) are gastrointestinal: abdominal discomfort or pain, and nausea; these may not necessarily indicate an abnormality of the biliary tract unless there is other clinical or radiologic evidence of disease. Less common adverse reactions include: Hypersensitivity reactions: anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, hypotension, throat tightness, bradycardia, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal cramping, diaphoresis, hives, rash, itching; and numbness of face, lips and eyes [see Contraindications (4)]. Neurological reactions: seizures, headache. Vasovagal reactions: dizziness, loss of consciousness, nausea, diaphoresis, syncope and hypotension (generally self-limiting). Other: nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypertension, urge to defecate, diarrhea, sneezing. Most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are: abdominal discomfort or pain, and nausea.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on limited human data and mechanism of action, Sincalide for Injection may cause preterm labor or spontaneous abortion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Limited available data with Sincalide for Injection are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal embryo-fetal development studies in which sincalide was administered to hamsters and rats during the period of organogenesis, no effects were seen at doses comparable to the maximum recommended clinical dose on a mg/kg basis. However, in a prenatal development study in which rats were administered sincalide during organogenesis through parturition, decreased weight gain and developmental delays were observed at a dose 122 times higher than the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data There were no effects on embryo-fetal development in hamsters when sincalide was administered subcutaneously at 250 or 750 ng/kg during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 13) at doses up to 0.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 120 ng/kg on a body surface area basis. No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in Sprague-Dawley rats at subcutaneous doses of 250, 450, or 750 ng/kg from Gestation Days 6 to16, representing 1.0 time the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. In a separate study at a higher dose of 90 mcg/kg administered subcutaneously to CFY rats from Gestation Day 10 through parturition (representing 122 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), offspring showed decreased growth, behavioral changes, and developmental delays. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of sincalide in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Sincalide for Injection and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from Sincalide for Injection or from the underlying condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Animal Data Direct injection of sincalide in neonatal rats reduced milk consumption with the youngest rats exhibiting the greatest sensitivity to this effect. Although safety margins relative to maternal doses cannot be calculated since rat pups were injected directly, the safety margin in the youngest rat pups was less than 0.1 on a body surface area bases compared to the maximum adult clinical dose. At higher doses administered subcutaneously in neonatal rats, transient behavioral changes and small effects on physical developmental milestones such as ear opening, eye opening, and incisor appearance were observed (at doses 10 to 200-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sincalide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

Overdosage symptoms should be treated symptomatically and should be of short duration. A single bolus intravenous injection of 0.05 mcg/kg (approximately 2 to 3 times the human dose of 0.02 mcg/kg), sincalide caused hypotension and bradycardia in dogs. In addition, higher doses injected intravenously once or repeatedly in dogs caused syncope and ECG changes (approximately 5 times the human dose of 0.02 mcg/kg). These effects were attributed to sincalide-induced vagal stimulation in that all were prevented by pretreatment with atropine or bilateral vagotomy."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Sincalide for Injection is a cholecystopancreatic-gastrointestinal hormone for parenteral administration. The agent is a synthetically-prepared C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin. Each single-dose vial of sincalide provides a sterile nonpyrogenic lyophilized white to off-white cake or powder consisting of 5 mcg sincalide with 30 mg arginine hydrochloride, 15 mg lysine hydrochloride,170 mg mannitol, 4 mg methionine, 2 mg pentetic acid, and 0.04 mg sodium metabisulfite. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 to 7.5 with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide prior to lyophilization. Sincalide is designated chemically as L-\u03b1-aspartyl-O- sulfo-L-tyrosyl-L-methionylglycyl-L-tryptophyl-L-methionyl- L-\u03b1-aspartyl-L-phenylalaninamide. Graphic formula: Sincalide Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action When injected intravenously, Sincalide stimulates gallbladder contraction and reduction in size. The evacuation of bile that results is similar to that which occurs physiologically in response to endogenous cholecystokinin. Sincalide also stimulates pancreatic secretion and intestinal motility causing pyloric contraction and slows gastric emptying. Concurrent administration of sincalide with secretin increases both the volume of pancreatic secretion and the output of bicarbonate and enzymes. This combined effect of secretin and sincalide permits the assessment of specific pancreatic function through measurement and analysis of the duodenal aspirate. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following an intravenous (bolus) injection of 0.02 mcg/kg sincalide, maximal contraction of the gallbladder occurred in 5 to 15 minutes. Sincalide reduced gallbladder radiographic size by at least 40%, which is generally considered satisfactory contraction."
