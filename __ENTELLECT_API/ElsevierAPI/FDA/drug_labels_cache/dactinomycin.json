Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Visually inspect the vials for particulate matter and discoloration, whenever solution and container permit. Preparation Reconstitute each vial by adding 1.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection without preservative using aseptic techniques. The reconstituted product should be a clear, gold-colored solution at a concentration of 500 mcg per mL. Further dilute the reconstituted product with 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to yield concentrations greater than 10 mcg/mL. Store at room temperature for no more than 4 hours from reconstitution to completion of injection or infusion. Discard after 4 hours. Dactinomycin for injection does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused portions. Administration Administer the diluted reconstituted product intravenously over 10 to 15 minutes. Do not use in-line filters with a cellulose ester membrane. Management of Extravasation Discontinue dactinomycin for injection for burning or stinging sensation or other evidence indicating perivenous infiltration or extravasation. Manage confirmed or suspected extravasation as follows: Terminate the injection or infusion immediately and restart in another vein. Intermittent application of ice to the site for 15 minutes 4 times daily for 3 days [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia: Increased risk of secondary malignancies following treatment. ( 5.1 ) Veno-occlusive Disease: Can cause severe or fatal VOD. Monitor for elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. Consider delaying next dose. ( 5.2 ) Extravasation: Immediately interrupt the injection or infusion and apply ice. ( 2.7 , 5.3 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor blood cell counts before each cycle. Delay next dose if severe myelosuppression has not improved. ( 5.4 ) Immunizations: Vaccination with live viral vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Discontinue treatment ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently. ( 5.7 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin prior to and during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall: Reduce dose by 50% during concomitant radiation. Use caution when administering within two months of radiation. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia The risk of developing secondary malignancies, including leukemia, is increased following treatment with dactinomycin. 5.2 Veno-occlusive Disease Severe and fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can occur with dactinomycin. Risk factors for the development of VOD include age younger than 4 years or concomitant radiotherapy. After treatment with dactinomycin, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these include elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. If patients develop VOD, considering delaying next dose of dactinomycin. Resume, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.3 Extravasation Extravasation of dactinomycin can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulcerations and persistent pain requiring wide excision surgery followed by split-thickness skin grafting. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately interrupt the injection or infusion. Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Observe closely and consult plastic surgery if necessary based on severity of reaction. 5.4 Myelosuppression Severe and fatal myelosuppression, which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, can occur with dactinomycin. The nadir in neutrophil counts generally occurs 14 to 21 days after administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle. Delay next dose of dactinomycin if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.5 Immunizations The safety with live viral vaccines following dactinomycin has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. 5.6 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe mucocutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), can occur with dactinomycin. Permanently discontinue dactinomycin in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. 5.7 Renal Toxicity Abnormalities of renal function can occur with dactinomycin. Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently during dactinomycin therapy. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur with dactinomycin. Monitor AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during dactinomycin therapy. 5.9 Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall Dactinomycin can increase radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, or erythema and vesiculation of the skin or buccal and pharyngeal mucosa. Reduce the dose of dactinomycin by 50% during concomitant radiation. Radiation recall, affecting previously treated radiation fields, can occur in patients who receive dactinomycin after prior radiation therapy. Although the risk can occur with distant radiation exposure, the risk appears highest when dactinomycin is administered within two months of prior radiation. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, dactinomycin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of dactinomycin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia: Increased risk of secondary malignancies following treatment. ( 5.1 ) Veno-occlusive Disease: Can cause severe or fatal VOD. Monitor for elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. Consider delaying next dose. ( 5.2 ) Extravasation: Immediately interrupt the injection or infusion and apply ice. ( 2.7 , 5.3 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor blood cell counts before each cycle. Delay next dose if severe myelosuppression has not improved. ( 5.4 ) Immunizations: Vaccination with live viral vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Discontinue treatment ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently. ( 5.7 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin prior to and during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall: Reduce dose by 50% during concomitant radiation. Use caution when administering within two months of radiation. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia The risk of developing secondary malignancies, including leukemia, is increased following treatment with dactinomycin. 5.2 Veno-occlusive Disease Severe and fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can occur with dactinomycin. Risk factors for the development of VOD include age younger than 4 years or concomitant radiotherapy. After treatment with dactinomycin for injection, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these include elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. If patients develop VOD, considering delaying next dose of dactinomycin. Resume, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.3 Extravasation Extravasation of dactinomycin for injection can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulcerations and persistent pain requiring wide excision surgery followed by split-thickness skin grafting. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately interrupt the injection or infusion. Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Observe closely and consult plastic surgery if necessary based on severity of reaction. 5.4 Myelosuppression Severe and fatal myelosuppression, which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, can occur with dactinomycin for injection. The nadir in neutrophil counts generally occurs 14 to 21 days after administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle. Delay next dose of dactinomycin for injection if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.5 Immunizations The safety with live viral vaccines following dactinomycin for injection has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. 5.6 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe mucocutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Permanently discontinue dactinomycin for injection in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. 5.7 Renal Toxicity Abnormalities of renal function can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently during dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Monitor AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.9 Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall Dactinomycin for injection can increase radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, or erythema and vesiculation of the skin or buccal and pharyngeal mucosa. Reduce the dose of dactinomycin for injection by 50% during concomitant radiation. Radiation recall, affecting previously treated radiation fields, can occur in patients who receive dactinomycin for injection after prior radiation therapy. Although the risk can occur with distant radiation exposure, the risk appears highest when dactinomycin for injection is administered within two months of prior radiation. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, dactinomycin for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of dactinomycin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin for injection and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin for injection and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Dactinomycin for injection, USP is a lyophilized powder. In the dry form the compound is an amorphous yellow to orange powder. The solution is clear, gold or yellow to orange colored and essentially free from visible particles. Dactinomycin for injection, USP is supplied in vials containing 0.5 mg (500 micrograms) of dactinomycin USP and 20.0 mg of mannitol. NDC 55150-928-02: 0.5 mg/vial in 2 mL single-dose vial; individually boxed Storage: Store at 20\u00ba to 25\u00baC (68\u00ba to 77\u00baF); [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from light and humidity. Special Handling: Animal studies have shown dactinomycin to be corrosive to skin, irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and highly toxic by the oral route. It has also been shown to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, embryotoxic and teratogenic. Due to the drug\u2019s toxic properties, appropriate precautions including the use of appropriate safety equipment are recommended for the preparation of dactinomycin for injection for parenteral administration. Inhalation of dust or vapors and contact with skin or mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Avoid exposure during pregnancy. The National Institutes of Health presently recommends that the preparation of injectable antineoplastic drugs should be performed in a Class II laminar flow biological safety cabinet. Personnel preparing drugs of this class should wear chemical resistant, impervious gloves, safety goggles, outer garments and shoe covers. Additional body garments should be used based upon the task being performed (e.g., sleevelets, apron, gauntlets, disposable suits) to avoid exposed skin surfaces and inhalation of vapors and dust. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing. Several other guidelines for proper handling and disposal of antineoplastic drugs have been published and should be considered. 1-4 Accidental Contact Measures: Should accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at least 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt ophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately, followed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation. Should accidental skin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Medical attention should be sought immediately. Contaminated clothing should be destroyed and shoes cleaned thoroughly before reuse (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of Solution for Intravenous Administration). The vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex."

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Visually inspect the vials for particulate matter and discoloration, whenever solution and container permit. Preparation Reconstitute each vial by adding 1.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection without preservative using aseptic techniques. The reconstituted product should be a clear, gold-colored solution at a concentration of 500 mcg/mL. Further dilute the reconstituted product with 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to yield concentrations greater than 10 mcg/mL. Store at room temperature for no more than 4 hours from reconstitution to completion of injection or infusion. Discard after 4 hours. Dactinomycin for injection does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused portions. Administration Administer the diluted reconstituted product intravenously over 10 to 15 minutes. Do not use in-line filters with a cellulose ester membrane. Management of Extravasation Discontinue dactinomycin for injection for burning or stinging sensation or other evidence indicating perivenous infiltration or extravasation. Manage confirmed or suspected extravasation as follows: Terminate the injection or infusion immediately and restart in another vein. Intermittent application of ice to the site for 15 minutes 4 times daily for 3 days [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia: Increased risk of secondary malignancies following treatment. ( 5.1 ) Veno-occlusive Disease: Can cause severe or fatal VOD. Monitor for elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. Consider delaying next dose. ( 5.2 ) Extravasation: Immediately interrupt the injection or infusion and apply ice. ( 2.7 , 5.3 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor blood cell counts before each cycle. Delay next dose if severe myelosuppression has not improved. ( 5.4 ) Immunizations: Vaccination with live viral vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Discontinue treatment ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently. ( 5.7 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin prior to and during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall: Reduce dose by 50% during concomitant radiation. Use caution when administering within two months of radiation. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia The risk of developing secondary malignancies, including leukemia, is increased following treatment with dactinomycin for injection. 5.2 Veno-occlusive Disease Severe and fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Risk factors for the development of VOD include age younger than 4 years or concomitant radiotherapy. After treatment with dactinomycin for injection, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these include elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. If patients develop VOD, considering delaying next dose of dactinomycin for injection. Resume, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.3 Extravasation Extravasation of dactinomycin for injection can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulcerations and persistent pain requiring wide excision surgery followed by split-thickness skin grafting. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately interrupt the injection or infusion. Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Observe closely and consult plastic surgery if necessary based on severity of reaction. 5.4 Myelosuppression Severe and fatal myelosuppression, which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, can occur with dactinomycin for injection. The nadir in neutrophil counts generally occurs 14 to 21 days after administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle. Delay next dose of dactinomycin for injection if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.5 Immunizations The safety with live viral vaccines following dactinomycin for injection has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. 5.6 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe mucocutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Permanently discontinue dactinomycin for injection in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. 5.7 Renal Toxicity Abnormalities of renal function can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently during dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Monitor AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.9 Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall Dactinomycin for injection can increase radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, or erythema and vesiculation of the skin or buccal and pharyngeal mucosa. Reduce the dose of dactinomycin for injection by 50% during concomitant radiation. Radiation recall, affecting previously treated radiation fields, can occur in patients who receive dactinomycin for injection after prior radiation therapy. Although the risk can occur with distant radiation exposure, the risk appears highest when dactinomycin for injection is administered within two months of prior radiation. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, dactinomycin for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of dactinomycin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin for injection and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin for injection and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia: Increased risk of secondary malignancies following treatment. ( 5.1 ) Veno-occlusive Disease: Can cause severe or fatal VOD. Monitor for elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. Consider delaying next dose. ( 5.2 ) Extravasation: Immediately interrupt the injection or infusion and apply ice. ( 2.7 , 5.3 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor blood cell counts before each cycle. Delay next dose if severe myelosuppression has not improved. ( 5.4 ) Immunizations: Vaccination with live viral vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Discontinue treatment ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently. ( 5.7 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin prior to and during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall: Reduce dose by 50% during concomitant radiation. Use caution when administering within two months of radiation. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia The risk of developing secondary malignancies, including leukemia, is increased following treatment with dactinomycin. 5.2 Veno-occlusive Disease Severe and fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can occur with dactinomycin. Risk factors for the development of VOD include age younger than 4 years or concomitant radiotherapy. After treatment with dactinomycin for injection, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these include elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. If patients develop VOD, considering delaying next dose of dactinomycin. Resume, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.3 Extravasation Extravasation of dactinomycin for injection can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulcerations and persistent pain requiring wide excision surgery followed by split-thickness skin grafting. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately interrupt the injection or infusion. Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Observe closely and consult plastic surgery if necessary based on severity of reaction. 5.4 Myelosuppression Severe and fatal myelosuppression, which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, can occur with dactinomycin for injection. The nadir in neutrophil counts generally occurs 14 to 21 days after administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle. Delay next dose of dactinomycin for injection if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.5 Immunizations The safety with live viral vaccines following dactinomycin for injection has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. 5.6 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe mucocutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Permanently discontinue dactinomycin for injection in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. 5.7 Renal Toxicity Abnormalities of renal function can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently during dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur with dactinomycin for injection. Monitor AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.9 Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall Dactinomycin for injection can increase radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, or erythema and vesiculation of the skin or buccal and pharyngeal mucosa. Reduce the dose of dactinomycin for injection by 50% during concomitant radiation. Radiation recall, affecting previously treated radiation fields, can occur in patients who receive dactinomycin for injection after prior radiation therapy. Although the risk can occur with distant radiation exposure, the risk appears highest when dactinomycin for injection is administered within two months of prior radiation. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, dactinomycin for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of dactinomycin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin for injection and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin for injection and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Dactinomycin for injection, USP is a lyophilized powder. In the dry form the compound is an amorphous yellow to orange powder. The solution is clear, gold or yellow to orange colored and essentially free from visible particles. Dactinomycin for injection, USP is supplied in vials containing 0.5 mg (500 micrograms) of dactinomycin USP and 20.0 mg of mannitol. NDC 55150-431-01: 0.5 mg/vial in 2 mL single-dose vial; individually boxed Storage: Store at 20\u00ba to 25\u00baC (68\u00ba to 77\u00baF); [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from light and humidity. Special Handling: Animal studies have shown dactinomycin to be corrosive to skin, irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and highly toxic by the oral route. It has also been shown to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, embryotoxic and teratogenic. Due to the drug\u2019s toxic properties, appropriate precautions including the use of appropriate safety equipment are recommended for the preparation of dactinomycin for injection for parenteral administration. Inhalation of dust or vapors and contact with skin or mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Avoid exposure during pregnancy. The National Institutes of Health presently recommends that the preparation of injectable antineoplastic drugs should be performed in a Class II laminar flow biological safety cabinet. Personnel preparing drugs of this class should wear chemical resistant, impervious gloves, safety goggles, outer garments and shoe covers. Additional body garments should be used based upon the task being performed (e.g., sleevelets, apron, gauntlets, disposable suits) to avoid exposed skin surfaces and inhalation of vapors and dust. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing. Several other guidelines for proper handling and disposal of antineoplastic drugs have been published and should be considered. 1 Accidental Contact Measures: Should accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at least 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt ophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately, followed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation. Should accidental skin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Medical attention should be sought immediately. Contaminated clothing should be destroyed and shoes cleaned thoroughly before reuse (see PRECAUTIONS, General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of Solution for Intravenous Administration). The vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex."

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Visually inspect the vials for particulate matter and discoloration, whenever solution and container permit. Preparation Reconstitute each vial by adding 1.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection without preservative using aseptic techniques. The reconstituted product should be a clear, gold-colored solution at a concentration of 500 mcg/mL. Further dilute the reconstituted product with 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to yield concentrations greater than 10 mcg/mL. Store at room temperature for no more than 4 hours from reconstitution to completion of injection or infusion. Discard after 4 hours. Dactinomycin for injection does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused portions. Administration Administer the diluted reconstituted product intravenously over 10 to 15 minutes. Do not use in-line filters with a cellulose ester membrane. Management of Extravasation Discontinue Dactinomycin for injection for burning or stinging sensation or other evidence indicating perivenous infiltration or extravasation. Manage confirmed or suspected extravasation as follows: Terminate the injection or infusion immediately and restart in another vein. Intermittent application of ice to the site for 15 minutes 4 times daily for 3 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia: Increased risk of secondary malignancies following treatment. ( 5.1 ) Veno-occlusive Disease: Can cause severe or fatal VOD. Monitor for elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. Consider delaying next dose. ( 5.2 ) Extravasation: Immediately interrupt the injection or infusion and apply ice. ( 2.7 , 5.3 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor blood cell counts before each cycle. Delay next dose if severe myelosuppression has not improved. ( 5.4 ) Immunizations: Vaccination with live viral vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Discontinue treatment ( 5.6 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently. ( 5.7 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin prior to and during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall: Reduce dose by 50% during concomitant radiation. Use caution when administering within two months of radiation. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia The risk of developing secondary malignancies, including leukemia, is increased following treatment with Dactinomycin for injection. 5.2 Veno-occlusive Disease Severe and fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can occur with Dactinomycin for injection. Risk factors for the development of VOD include age younger than 4 years or concomitant radiotherapy. After treatment with Dactinomycin for injection, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these include elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. If patients develop VOD, considering delaying next dose of Dactinomycin for injection. Resume reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.3 Extravasation Extravasation of Dactinomycin for injection can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulcerations and persistent pain requiring wide excision surgery followed by split-thickness skin grafting. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately interrupt the injection or infusion. Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Observe closely and consult plastic surgery if necessary based on severity of reaction. 5.4 Myelosuppression Severe and fatal myelosuppression, which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, can occur with Dactinomycin for injection. The nadir in neutrophil counts generally occurs 14 to 21 days after administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle. Delay next dose of Dactinomycin for injection if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on severity of reaction and disease being treated. 5.5 Immunizations The safety with live viral vaccines following Dactinomycin for injection has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment. 5.6 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe mucocutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), can occur with Dactinomycin for injection. Permanently discontinue Dactinomycin for injection in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. 5.7 Renal Toxicity Abnormalities of renal function can occur with Dactinomycin for injection. Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently during Dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur with Dactinomycin for injection. Monitor AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during Dactinomycin for injection therapy. 5.9 Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall Dactinomycin for injection can increase radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, or erythema and vesiculation of the skin or buccal and pharyngeal mucosa. Reduce the dose of Dactinomycin for injection by 50% during concomitant radiation. Radiation recall, affecting previously treated radiation fields, can occur in patients who receive Dactinomycin for injection after prior radiation therapy. Although the risk can occur with distant radiation exposure, the risk appears highest when Dactinomycin for injection is administered within two months of prior radiation. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Dactinomycin for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of dactinomycin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Dactinomycin for injection and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Dactinomycin for injection and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dactinomycin is a carcinogen in animals. Local sarcomas were produced in mice and rats after repeated subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. Mesenchymal tumors occurred in male rats given intraperitoneal injections of 50 mcg/kg, 2 to 5 times per week, for 18 weeks, at doses (based on body surface area) 0.5 times the clinical dose of 1250 mcg/m 2 . Dactinomycin was mutagenic in several in vitro and in vivo test systems including human fibroblasts and leukocytes, and HeLa cells. DNA damage and cytogenetic effects have been demonstrated in the mouse and the rat."
