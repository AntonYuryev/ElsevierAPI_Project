The data described below reflect exposure to L-glutamine in 187 patients, including 136 exposed for 6 months and 109 exposed for \u22651 year. L-glutamine was studied in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials (a phase 3 study, n=230 and a phase 2 study, n=70). In these trials, patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle \u03b2 0 -thalassemia were randomized to receive L-glutamine (n=187) or placebo (n=111) orally twice daily for 48 weeks followed by 3 weeks of tapering. Both studies included pediatric and adult patients (5-58 years of age) and 54% were female. The majority of patients were black (97.3%), had a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia (89.9%) and were receiving hydroxyurea at baseline (63.4%). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 2.7% (n=5) of patients receiving L-glutamine. These adverse reactions included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash. Serious adverse reactions were reported in both treatment groups, more frequently in the placebo group, and were consistent with the underlying disease. Three deaths (3/187=1.6%) occurred during the study in the L-glutamine treatment group as compared to none in the placebo treatment group. None of the deaths were considered to be related to L-glutamine treatment. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 10% of patients treated with L-glutamine are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with L-glutamine. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of L-glutamine in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant or the effect on milk production. The developmental and health benefits from breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for L-glutamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from L-glutamine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of L-glutamine have been established in pediatric patients 5 years and older. Use of L-glutamine is supported by evidence from 2 placebo-controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. The clinical studies enrolled 110 pediatric patients in the following age groups: 46 children (5 years up to less than 12 years) and 64 adolescents (12 years to less than 17 years). The safety and effectiveness of L-glutamine in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease younger than 5 years old has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of L-glutamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of the amino acid L-glutamine in treating sickle cell disease (SCD) is not fully understood. Oxidative stress phenomena are involved in the pathophysiology of SCD. Sickle red blood cells (RBCs) are more susceptible to oxidative damage than normal RBCs, which may contribute to the chronic hemolysis and vaso-occlusive events associated with SCD. The pyridine nucleotides, NAD + and its reduced form NADH, play roles in regulating and preventing oxidative damage in RBCs. L-glutamine may improve the NAD redox potential in sickle RBCs through increasing the availability of reduced glutathione. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vivo analyses demonstrated that L-glutamine supplementation improved NAD redox potential. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of L-glutamine has been studied in healthy subjects and a variety of disease states. Relevant results from published literature are summarized below. Absorption Following single-dose oral administration of L-glutamine at 0.1 g/kg, mean peak L-glutamine concentration was 1028 \u03bcM (or 150 mcg/mL) occurring approximately 30 minutes after administration. The pharmacokinetics following multiple oral doses at 0.1 g/kg, 0.3 g/kg, and 0.6 g/kg found peak concentrations increasing with each dose, but maximum concentration did not increase proportionally to the dose, suggesting a saturable absorption process. The peak concentration was seen occurring approximately one hour after administration. There was no accumulation of L-glutamine levels upon multiple oral doses administered twice-daily. Effect of Food No significant change in L-glutamine concentration was associated with food, suggesting that L-glutamine can be taken with or without food. Distribution After multiple oral doses, the apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be approximately 750 mL/kg. Elimination After an intravenous bolus dose, the terminal elimination half-life of L-glutamine was approximately one hour. Metabolism Endogenous L-glutamine participates in various metabolic activities, including the formation of glutamate, and synthesis of proteins, nucleotides, and amino sugars. Exogenous L-glutamine is anticipated to undergo similar metabolism. Excretion Metabolism is the major route of disappearance for L-glutamine from the plasma. Urinary excretion of L-glutamine was less than 0.3% of the administered dose in intravenous infusion studies. Specific Populations In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, body weight was found to be a significant covariate of L-glutamine exposures supporting the tiered body weight based dosing of L-glutamine. The pharmacokinetics of L-glutamine has not been studied in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions No drug interaction studies have been conducted."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of L-glutamine in sickle cell disease was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial entitled \"A Phase III Safety and Efficacy Study of L-Glutamine to Treat Sickle Cell Disease or Sickle \u03b2 0 -thalassemia\" [NCT01179217] (see Table 3). The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of L-glutamine in 230 patients (5 to 58 years of age) with sickle cell anemia or sickle \u03b2 0 -thalassemia who had 2 or more painful crises within 12 months prior to enrollment. Eligible patients stabilized on hydroxyurea for at least 3 months continued their therapy throughout the study. The trial excluded patients who had received blood products within 3 weeks, had renal insufficiency or uncontrolled liver disease, or were pregnant (or planning pregnancy) or lactating. Study patients received L-glutamine or placebo for a treatment duration of 48 weeks followed by 3 weeks of tapering. Efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in the number of sickle cell crises through Week 48 and prior to the start of tapering among patients that received L-glutamine compared to patients who received placebo. This clinical benefit was observed irrespective of hydroxyurea use. A sickle cell crisis was defined as a visit to an emergency room/medical facility for sickle cell disease-related pain which was treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or parenterally administered ketorolac. In addition, the occurrence of chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration were considered sickle cell crises. Treatment with L-glutamine also resulted in fewer hospitalizations due to sickle cell pain at Week 48, fewer cumulative days in hospital and a lower incidence of acute chest syndrome. Table 3.
