      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Niacin extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. Niacin extended-release tablets in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release tablets did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Niacin extended-release tablets contain extended-release niacin (nicotinic acid), and is indicated: To reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. ( 1 ) To reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2.1 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. ( 2.1 ) Maintenance dose: 1,000 mg to 2,000 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily dose Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Dosage INITIAL TITRATION SCHEDULE 1 to 4 500 mg 1 Niacin extended-release 500 mg tablet at bedtime 5 to 8 1,000 mg 1 Niacin extended-release 1,000 mg tablet or 2 Niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 1,500 mg 2 Niacin extended-release 750 mg tablets or 3 Niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 2,000 mg 2 Niacin extended-release 1,000 mg tablets or 4 Niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1,000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1,500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2,000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1,000 mg tablet) to 2,000 mg (two 1,000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablet doses than men [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1,000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release tablet preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release tablets are used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release tablets therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release tablets can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release tablets doses ranging from 500 to 3,000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release tablets for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release tablets. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2,000 mg). Caution should be observed when Niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2,000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release tablets and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release tablets controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release tablets. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1,500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Number of niacin extended-release tablet patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release tablets during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1,000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (>65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender (8.8) ] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2,000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2 to 3% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2,000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablets dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2,000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below (Table 5). Table 5.

Gender Effect: Combined data from the three placebo-controlled niacin extended-release tablet studies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia suggest that, at each niacin extended-release tablet dose level studied, changes in lipid concentrations are greater for women than for men (Table 6).

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release tablets (forced titration to 2,000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u226440 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). Table 7.

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. 1. Niacin extended-release tablet is indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. 2. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. 3. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. 4. Niacin extended-release tablet in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. 5. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release tablets did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Niacin extended-release tablet contains extended-release niacin (nicotinic acid), and is indicated: \u2022 To reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. ( 1 ) \u2022 To reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia. ( 1 ) \u2022 In combination with a bile acid binding resin: o Slows progression or promotes regression of atherosclerotic disease in patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2.1 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. ( 2.1 ) Maintenance dose: 1000 to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily dose Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Dosage INITIAL TITRATION 1 to 4 500 mg 1 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablet at bedtime SCHEDULE 5 to 8 1000 mg 1 niacin extended-release 1000 mg tablet or 2 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 1500 mg 3 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 2000 mg 2 niacin extended-release 1000 mg tablets or 4 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If Niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release tablets preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release tablet is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release tablet is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release tablets therapy. \u2022 Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) \u2022 Niacin extended-release tablets can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500 to 2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95-3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release tablets doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release tablets for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release tablets. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release tablet has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablet is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release tablets has been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablet is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablet has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablet dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release tablets and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release tablets controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release tablets. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Number of niacin extended-release tablets patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500 to 2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders : tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders : blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders : peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders : hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders : dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders : syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (>65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender ( 8.8 )]. Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Lovastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2 to 3% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Simvastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablets dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below (Table 5). Table 5.

Gender Effect: Combined data from the three placebo-controlled niacin extended-relase tablets studies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia suggest that, at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level studied, changes in lipid concentrations are greater for women than for men (Table 6).

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release tablets (forced titration to 2000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u226440 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). Table 7.

At niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg/day, median changes from baseline (25th, 75th percentiles) for LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were -3% (-14, +12%), +27% (+13, +38%), and -33% (-50, -19%), respectively."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Patient Counseling Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release tablets. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release tablets use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release tablets to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release tablets should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. 1. Niacin extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. 2. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. 3. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. 4. Niacin extended-release tablets in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. 5. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release tablets did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2.1 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. ( 2.1 ) Maintenance dose: 1000 to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin Extended-release Tablets, USP should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily Dose Niacin Extended-release Tablets Dosage INITIAL TITRATION SCHEDULE 1 to 4 500 mg 1 niacin extended-release tablet 500 mg at bedtime 5 to 8 1000 mg 1 niacin extended-release tablet 1000 mg or 2 niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 1500 mg 3 niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 2000 mg 2 niacin extended-release tablets 1000 mg or 4 niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1 ), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1 ). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release tablets preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release tablets are used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release tablets therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release tablets can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163-177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87-1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95-3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release tablets doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release tablets for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release tablets. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Chartwell RX, LLC. at 1-845-232-1683 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21-75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release tablets and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release tablets controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release tablets. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Number of niacin extended-release tablets patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Bile Acid Sequestrants: Bile acid sequestrants have a high niacin-binding capacity and should be taken at least 4 to 6 hours before niacin extended-release tablets administration. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Statins Caution should be used when prescribing niacin (\u22651 gm/day) with statins as these drugs can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study results suggest that the bile acid-binding resins have high niacin binding capacity. Therefore, 4 to 6 hours, or as great an interval as possible, should elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and the administration of niacin extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. 7.4 Antihypertensive Therapy Niacin may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. 7.5 Other Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin extended-release tablets. 7.6 Laboratory Test Interactions Niacin may produce false elevations in some fluorometric determinations of plasma or urinary catecholamines.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue in patients with hyperlipidemia; assess individual risks and benefits in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment. ( 8.2 ) Renal impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release tablets during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release tablets, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (>65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender ( 8.8 )] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2-3% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablets dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release tablets (forced titration to 2000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u2264 40 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). Table 7.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Patient Counseling Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release tablets. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release tablets use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release tablets to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release tablets should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Lactation Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. Manufactured for: Chartwell RX, LLC.

Especially tell your doctor if you take: other medicines to lower cholesterol or triglycerides aspirin blood pressure medicines blood thinner medicines large amounts of alcohol Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take niacin extended-release tablets? Take niacin extended-release tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Take niacin extended-release tablets whole. Do not break, crush or chew niacin extended-release tablets before swallowing. Take niacin extended-release tablets 1 time a day at bedtime after a low-fat snack. Niacin extended-release tablets should not be taken on an empty stomach. All forms of niacin are not the same as niacin extended-release tablets. Do not switch between forms of niacin without first talking to your doctor as severe liver damage can occur. Do not change your dose or stop taking niacin extended-release tablets unless your doctor tells you to. If you need to stop taking niacin extended-release tablets, call your doctor before you start taking niacin extended-release tablets again. Your doctor may need to lower your dose of niacin extended-release tablets. If you take too much niacin extended-release tablets, call your doctor right away. Medicines used to lower your cholesterol called bile acid resins, such as colestipol and cholestyramine, should not be taken at the same time of day as niacin extended-release tablets. You should take niacin extended-release tablets and the bile acid resin medicine at least 4 to 6 hours apart. Your doctor may do blood tests before you start taking niacin extended-release tablets and during your treatment. You should see your doctor regularly to check your cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to check for side effects. What are the possible side effects of niacin extended-release tablets? Niacin extended-release tablets may cause serious side effects, including: unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness severe liver problems. Signs of liver problems include: increased tiredness dark colored urine (tea-colored) loss of appetite light colored stools nausea right upper stomach (abdomen) pain yellowing of your skin or whites of your eye itchy skin high blood sugar level (glucose) Call your doctor right away if you have any of the side effects listed above. The most common side effects of niacin extended-release tablets include: flushing diarrhea nausea vomiting increased cough rash itching Flushing is the most common side effect of niacin extended-release tablets. Flushing happens when tiny blood vessels near the surface of the skin (especially on the face, neck, chest and/or back) open wider. Symptoms of flushing may include any or all of the following: warmth redness itching tingling of the skin Flushing does not always happen. If it does, it is usually within 2 to 4 hours after taking a dose of niacin extended-release tablets. Flushing may last for a few hours. Flushing is more likely to happen when you first start taking niacin extended-release tablets or when your dose of niacin extended-release tablets is increased. Flushing may get better after several weeks. If you wake up at night because of flushing, get up slowly, especially if you: feel dizzy or faint take blood pressure medicines To lower your chance of flushing: Ask your doctor if you can take aspirin to help lower the flushing side effect from niacin extended-release tablets. You can take aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) about 30 minutes before you take niacin extended-release tablets to help lower the flushing side effect. Do not drink hot beverages (including coffee), alcohol, or eat spicy foods around the time you take niacin extended-release tablets. Take niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat snack to lessen upset stomach. People with high cholesterol and heart disease are at risk for a heart attack. Symptoms of a heart attack may be different from a flushing reaction from niacin extended-release tablets. The following may be symptoms of a heart attack due to heart disease and not a flushing reaction: chest pain pain in other areas of your upper body such as one or both arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach shortness of breath sweating nausea lightheadedness The chest pain you have with a heart attack may feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. Heart attacks may be sudden and intense, but often start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a heart attack. Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of niacin extended-release tablets. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store niacin extended-release tablets? Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 C (68\u00ba to 77\u00baF) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Keep niacin extended-release tablets and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of niacin extended-release tablets.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The role of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in atherogenesis is supported by pathological observations, clinical studies, and many animal experiments. Observational epidemiological studies have clearly established that high total or LDL cholesterol and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are risk factors for coronary heart disease. The Coronary Drug Project 1 , completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of nicotinic acid and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). Over an observation period of five years, nicotinic acid showed a statistically significant benefit in decreasing nonfatal, recurrent myocardial infarctions. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo (p< 0.004). Though total mortality was similar in the two groups at five years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p=N.S.), in a fifteen year cumulative follow-up there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the nicotinic acid group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p=0.0004) 2 . The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and nicotinic acid therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery 3 . The primary, per subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After two years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (N=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (N=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered (p<0.005). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for four years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p< 0.0001) 4 . The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with apolipoprotein B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography 5 . Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL cholesterol was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or nicotinic acid plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the nicotinic acid plus colestipol group. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received nicotinic acid plus colestipol. Nicotinic acid (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses produces an average 10% to 20% reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, a 30% to 70% reduction in triglycerides, and an average 20% to 35% increase in HDL cholesterol. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in total HDL is associated with a shift in the distribution of HDL sub-fractions (as defined by ultra-centrifugation) with an increase in the HDL2:HDL3 ratio and an increase in apolipoprotein A-I content. The mechanism by which nicotinic acid exerts these effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Nicotinic acid treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. The effect of nicotinic acid-induced changes in lipids/lipoproteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without pre-existing coronary disease has not been established. Pharmacokinetics Following an oral dose, the pharmacokinetic profile of nicotinic acid is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short plasma elimination half-life. At a 1 gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 \u00b5g/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE I. Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Nicotinic acid, alone or in combination with a bile-acid binding resin, is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb) \u2020 , when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also the NCEP treatment guidelines 6 ). Prior to initiating therapy with nicotinic acid, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. II. Nicotinic acid is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia)\u2020 who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum triglyceride levels over 2,000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia) \u2020 . Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1,000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop pancreatitis. Therapy with nicotinic acid may be considered for those subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. Some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1,000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of nicotinic acid therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL. Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia 7 . \u2020 Classification of Hyperlipoproteinemias Lipoproteins Lipid Elevations Type Elevated Major Minor C = cholesterol, TG = triglycerides LDL = low-density lipoprotein VLDL = very low-density lipoprotein IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein I (rare) Chylomicrons TG \u2191\u2192 C IIa LDL C .....

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid products for immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid at equivalent doses. Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with nicotinic acid. Serum transaminase levels, including ALT (SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every six weeks to twelve weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6 month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to three times the upper limit of normal and are persistent, the drug should be discontinued. Liver biopsy should be considered if elevations persist beyond discontinuation of the drug. Nicotinic acid should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of nicotinic acid. Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of nicotinic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Physicians contemplating combined therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and nicotinic acid should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Before instituting therapy with nicotinic acid, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ]. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during nicotinic acid therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Caution should also be used when nicotinic acid is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with nicotinic acid therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Drug Interactions HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors See WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle . Antihypertensive Therapy Nicotinic acid may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. Other Concomitant alcohol or hot drinks may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided at the time of drug ingestion. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Nicotinic acid administered to mice for a lifetime as a 1% solution in drinking water was not carcinogenic. The mice in this study received approximately 6 to 8 times a human dose of 3,000 milligrams/day as determined on a milligram/square meter basis. Nicotinic acid was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames test. No studies on impairment of fertility have been performed. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nicotinic acid. It is also not known whether nicotinic acid at doses typically used for lipid disorders can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. If a woman receiving nicotinic acid for primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa or IIb) becomes pregnant, the drug should be discontinued. If a woman being treated with nicotinic acid for hypertriglyceridemia (Types IV or V) conceives, the benefits and risks of continued drug therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from lipid-altering doses of nicotinic acid, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children and adolescents have not been established."

Start with one-half tablet (250 mg) as a single daily dose following the evening meal. The frequency of dosing and total daily dose can be increased every four to seven days until the desired LDL cholesterol and/or triglyceride level is achieved or the first-level therapeutic dose of 1.5 to 2 grams/day is reached. If the patient's hyperlipidemia is not adequately controlled after 2 months at this level, the dosage can then be increased at two to four week intervals to 3 grams/day (1 gram three times per day). In patients with marked lipid abnormalities, a higher dose is occasionally required, but generally should not exceed 6 grams/day. Flushing of the skin appears frequently and can be minimized by pretreatment with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of nicotinic acid and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Niacin extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. Niacin extended-release tablets in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release tablets did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Niacin extended-release tablets contain extended-release niacin (nicotinic acid) and are indicated: To reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. ( 1 ) To reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2.1 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. (2.1 ) Maintenance dose: 1,000 to 2,000 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily dose Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Dosage INITIAL TITRATION 1 to 4 500 mg 1 Niacin extended-release tablet 500 mg at bedtime SCHEDULE 5 to 8 1,000 mg 1 Niacin extended-release tablet 1,000 mg or 2 Niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 1,500 mg 3 Niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 2,000 mg 2 Niacin extended-release tablets 1,000 mg or 4 Niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1,000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1,500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2,000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4\u2013week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1,000 mg tablet) to 2,000 mg (two 1,000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1,000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release, therapy with niacin extended-release should be initiated with low doses (i.e. 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3,414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 mg/dL to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500 mg/day to 2,000 mg/day (n = 1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 mg to 150 mg, n = 1,696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P < 0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P = 0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p = 0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release doses ranging from 500 mg to 3,000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 weeks to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2,000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2,000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 years to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence > 5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1,500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of patients treated with niacin extended-release and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3,414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500 mg/day to 2,000 mg/day (n=1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 mg to 150 mg, n=1,696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue in patients with hyperlipidemia; assess individual risks and benefits in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment. ( 8.2 ) Renal impairment: Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release is contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u2264 16 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1,000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60% to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u2264 16 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (> 65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender (8.8) ] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release 2,000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% to 3% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release 2,000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10% to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo ( p < 0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p < 0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p = 0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-Release Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release dosed at 1,000 mg, 1,500 mg or 2,000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2,000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below (Table 5). Table 5.

Gender Effect: Combined data from the three placebo-controlled niacin extended-release studies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia suggest that, at each niacin extended-release dose level studied, changes in lipid concentrations are greater for women than for men (Table 6).

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release (forced titration to 2,000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u2264 40 mg/dL, TG \u2264 400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264 160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). Table 7.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Patient Counseling Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Lactation Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablet. Manufactured By: Amneal Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd.

Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Niacin extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. Niacin extended-release tablets in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them.

The recommended maintenance dose is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1,000 mg tablets) to 2,000 mg (two 1,000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1,000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release, therapy with niacin extended-release should be initiated with low doses (i.e. 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3,414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 mg/dL to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day (n=1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 mg to 150 mg, n=1,696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P < 0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u2265 1 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release doses ranging from 500 mg to 3,000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2,000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2,000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%) and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e. warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1,500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of patients treated with niacin extended-release and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Number of niacin extended-release patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3,414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day (n=1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 mg to 150 mg, n=1,696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and one (< 0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue in patients with hyperlipidemia; assess individual risks and benefits in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment. ( 8.2 ) Renal impairment: Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release is contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablet. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release.",

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1,000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60% to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u2264 16 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (> 65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender (8.8) ] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release 2,000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% to 3% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release 2,000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10% to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo ( p < 0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p < 0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-Release Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release dosed at 1,000 mg, 1,500 mg or 2,000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2,000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below (Table 5). Table 5.

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release (forced titration to 2,000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u2264 40 mg/dL, TG \u2264 400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264 160, or < 130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). Table 7.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Patient Counseling Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Lactation Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. Manufactured By: Amneal Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Niacin extended-release tablets, USP are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. Niacin extended-release in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Niacin extended-release tablets, USP contain extended-release niacin (nicotinic acid), and are indicated: To reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.( 1 ) To reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia.( 1 ) In combination with a bile acid binding resin: Slows progression or promotes regression of atherosclerotic disease in patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia. ( 1 ) As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. ( 1 ) To reduce TG in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets, USP should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2 .1) Dose range: 500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily. ( 2 .1) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets, USP must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. ( 2 .1) Maintenance dose: 1,000 mg to 2,000 mg once daily. ( 2 .2) Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2 .2) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin extended-release tablets, USP should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets, USP must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily dose Niacin Extended-Release Dosage INITIAL TITRATION 1 to 4 500 mg 1 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablet at bedtime SCHEDULE 5 to 8 1,000 mg 1 niacin extended-release 1,000 mg tablet or 2 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 1,500 mg 2 niacin extended-release 750 mg tablets or 3 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 2,000 mg 2 niacin extended-release 1,000 mg tablets or 4 niacin extended-release 500 mg tablets at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1,000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1,500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2,000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets, USP should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4\u2013week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1,000 mg tablet) to 2,000 mg (two 1,000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2,000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets, USP doses than men [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1,000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets, USP dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets, USP ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets, USP should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets, USP titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets, USP therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets, USP should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets, USP in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets, USP are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets, USP should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release tablets preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 .1)]. Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3,414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day (n=1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1,696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended - release should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended - release . Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release doses ranging from 500 mg to 3,000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2,000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2,000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u00b7 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u00b7 Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u00b7 Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u00b7 Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release dose). ( 2 .2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1,500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions by Dose Level in \u2265 5% of Patients and at an Incidence Greater than Placebo; Regardless of Causality Assessment in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Placebo-Controlled Studies Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Treatment @ Recommended Daily Maintenance Doses \u2020 Placebo 500 mg \u2021 1,000 mg 1,500 mg 2,000 mg (n = 157) (n = 87) (n = 110) (n = 136) (n = 95) % % % % % Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 13 7 10 10 14 Nausea 7 5 6 4 11 Vomiting 4 0 2 4 9 Respiratory Cough, Increased 6 3 2 < 2 8 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Pruritus 2 8 0 3 0 Rash 0 5 5 5 0 Vascular Disorders Flushing & 19 68 69 63 55 Note: Percentages are calculated from the total number of patients in each column. \u2020 Adverse reactions are reported at the initial dose where they occur. @ Pooled results from placebo-controlled studies; for niacin extended-release tablets, n = 245 and median treatment duration = 16 weeks. Number of niacin extended-release tablets patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3,414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day (n=1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 mg to 150 mg, n=1,696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Statins: Caution should be used when prescribing niacin with statins as these agents can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Bile Acid Sequestrants: Bile acid sequestrants have a high niacin-binding capacity and should be taken at least 4 to 6 hours before niacin extended-release administration. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Statins Caution should be used when prescribing niacin (\u22651 gm/day) with statins as these drugs can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study results suggest that the bile acid-binding resins have high niacin binding capacity. Therefore, 4 to 6 hours, or as great an interval as possible, should elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and the administration of niacin extended-release [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. 7.4 Antihypertensive Therapy Niacin may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. 7.5 Other Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin extended-release. 7.6 Laboratory Test Interactions Niacin may produce false elevations in some fluorometric determinations of plasma or urinary catecholamines. Niacin may also give false-positive reactions with cupric sulfate solution (Benedict\u2019s reagent) in urine glucose tests."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue in patients with hyperlipidemia; assess individual risks and benefits in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. (8.1) Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment. (8.2) Renal impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release tablets during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1,000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (> 65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender ( 8.8 )]. Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Lovastatin When niacin extended-release 2,000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2 to 3% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Simvastatin When niacin extended-release 2,000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1) ]. Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1,000 mg, 1,500 mg or 2,000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level (see Gender Effect, below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablets dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2,000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect, below). Table 4.

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release tablets (forced titration to 2,000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u226440 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). Table 7.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Patient Counseling Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release tablets. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release tablets use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release tablets to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release tablets should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Lactation Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets."

      "Dispense with Patient Information available at: https://www.sunpharma.com/usa/products PATIENT INFORMATION Niacin (nahy-uh-sin) Extended-Release Tablets, USP for oral use Read this information carefully before you start taking niacin extended-release tablets and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What are niacin extended-release tablets? Niacin extended-release tablets are prescription medicines used with diet and exercise to increase the good cholesterol (HDL) and lower the bad cholesterol (LDL) and fats (triglycerides) in your blood. Niacin extended-release tablets are also used to lower the risk of heart attack in people who have had a heart attack and have high cholesterol. In people with coronary artery disease and high cholesterol, niacin extended-release tablets, when used with a bile acid-binding resin (another cholesterol medicine) can slow down or lessen the build-up of plaque (fatty deposits) in your arteries. In people with heart problems and well-controlled cholesterol, taking niacin extended-release tablets with another cholesterol-lowering medicine (simvastatin) does not reduce heart attacks or strokes more than taking simvastatin alone. It is not known if niacin extended-release tablets are safe and effective in children 16 years of age and under. Who should not take niacin extended-release tablets?

Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1 ), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1 ). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release tablets preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release tablets are used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release tablets therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release tablets can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163-177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87-1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95-3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release tablets doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release tablets for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release tablets. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21-75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release tablets and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release tablets controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release tablets. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Number of niacin extended-release tablets patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Statins: Caution should be used when prescribing niacin with statins as these agents can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Bile Acid Sequestrants: Bile acid sequestrants have a high niacin-binding capacity and should be taken at least 4 to 6 hours before niacin extended-release tablets administration. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Statins Caution should be used when prescribing niacin (\u22651 gm/day) with statins as these drugs can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study results suggest that the bile acid-binding resins have high niacin binding capacity. Therefore, 4 to 6 hours, or as great an interval as possible, should elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and the administration of niacin extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. 7.4 Antihypertensive Therapy Niacin may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. 7.5 Other Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin extended-release tablets. 7.6 Laboratory Test Interactions Niacin may produce false elevations in some fluorometric determinations of plasma or urinary catecholamines. Niacin may also give false-positive reactions with cupric sulfate solution (Benedict\u2019s reagent) in urine glucose tests."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue in patients with hyperlipidemia; assess individual risks and benefits in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment. ( 8.2 ) Renal impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release tablets during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release tablets, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (>65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender ( 8.8 )] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2-3% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo ( Table 3 ). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3.

In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablets dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2000 mg ( Table 4 ). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release tablets (forced titration to 2000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u2264 40 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below ( Table 7 ). Table 7.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Patient Counseling Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended diet, a regular exercise program, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release tablets. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release tablets use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release tablets to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release tablets should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Lactation Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. Distributed by: Lannett Company, Inc.

Do not switch between forms of niacin without first talking to your doctor as severe liver damage can occur. Do not change your dose or stop taking niacin extended-release tablets unless your doctor tells you to. If you need to stop taking niacin extended-release tablets, call your doctor before you start taking niacin extended-release tablets again. Your doctor may need to lower your dose of niacin extended-release tablets. If you take too much niacin extended-release tablets, call your doctor right away. Medicines used to lower your cholesterol called bile acid resins, such as colestipol and cholestyramine, should not be taken at the same time of day as niacin extended-release tablets. You should take niacin extended-release tablets and the bile acid resin medicine at least 4 to 6 hours apart. Your doctor may do blood tests before you start taking niacin extended-release tablets and during your treatment. You should see your doctor regularly to check your cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to check for side effects. What are the possible side effects of niacin extended-release tablets? Niacin extended-release tablets may cause serious side effects, including: unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness severe liver problems. Signs of liver problems include: increased tiredness dark colored urine (tea-colored) loss of appetite light colored stools nausea right upper stomach (abdomen) pain yellowing of your skin or whites of your eye itchy skin high blood sugar level (glucose) Call your doctor right away if you have any of the side effects listed above. The most common side effects of niacin extended-release tablets include: flushing diarrhea nausea vomiting increased cough rash itching Flushing is the most common side effect of niacin extended-release tablets. Flushing happens when tiny blood vessels near the surface of the skin (especially on the face, neck, chest and/or back) open wider. Symptoms of flushing may include any or all of the following: warmth redness itching tingling of the skin Flushing does not always happen. If it does, it is usually within 2 to 4 hours after taking a dose of niacin extended-release tablets. Flushing may last for a few hours. Flushing is more likely to happen when you first start taking niacin extended-release tablets or when your dose of niacin extended-release tablets is increased. Flushing may get better after several weeks. If you wake up at night because of flushing, get up slowly, especially if you: feel dizzy or faint take blood pressure medicines To lower your chance of flushing: Ask your doctor if you can take aspirin to help lower the flushing side effect from niacin extended-release tablets. You can take aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) about 30 minutes before you take niacin extended-release tablets to help lower the flushing side effect. Do not drink hot beverages (including coffee), alcohol, or eat spicy foods around the time you take niacin extended-release tablets. Take niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat snack to lessen upset stomach. People with high cholesterol and heart disease are at risk for a heart attack. Symptoms of a heart attack may be different from a flushing reaction from niacin extended-release tablets. The following may be symptoms of a heart attack due to heart disease and not a flushing reaction: chest pain pain in other areas of your upper body such as one or both arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach shortness of breath sweating nausea lightheadedness The chest pain you have with a heart attack may feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. Heart attacks may be sudden and intense, but often start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a heart attack. Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of niacin extended-release tablets. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2.1 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4 week period. ( 2.1 ) Maintenance dose: 1000 to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week ( s ) Daily Dose Niacin Dosage INITIAL 1 to 4 500 mg 1 Niacin extended-release tablet, 500 mg at bedtime TITRATION SCHEDULE 5 to 8 1000 mg 1 Niacin extended-release tablet, 1000 mg or 2 Niacin extended-release tablets, 500 mg at bedtime After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 1500 mg 2 Niacin extended-release tablets, 750 mg or 3 Niacin extended-release tablets, 500 mg at bedtime 2000 mg 2 Niacin extended-release tablets, 1000 mg or 4 Niacin extended-release tablets, 500 mg at bedtime 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose).Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets USP ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablet is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warning and Precautions ( 5 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.2 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release tablets can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) Niacin extended-release tablet preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release tablet is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release tablet is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release tablets therapy. 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500 to 2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release tablets doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release tablets for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release tablets. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose : Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count : Niacin extended-release tablet has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablet is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT) : Niacin extended-release tablet has been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablet is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid : Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus : In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablet has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks. 16% of patients on niacin extended-release tablets and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release tablets controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release tablets. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500 to 2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \"blood glucose increased\" (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \"diabetes mellitus\" (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Cardiac Disorders tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye Disorders blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal Disorders peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary Disorders hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition Disorders decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue Disorders myalgia, myopathy Nervous system Disorders dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal Disorders dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue Disorders maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular Disorders syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus.

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Statins Caution should be used when prescribing niacin (\u2265 1 gm/day) with statins as these drugs can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study results suggest that the bile acid-binding resins have high niacin binding capacity. Therefore, 4 to 6 hours, or as great an interval as possible, should elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and the administration of niacin extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. 7.4 Antihypertensive Therapy Niacin may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. 7.5 Other Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin extended-release tablets . 7.6 Laboratory Test Interactions Niacin may produce false elevations in some fluorometric determinations of plasma or urinary catecholamines. Niacin may also give false-positive reactions with cupric sulfate solution (Benedict's reagent) in urine glucose tests."

( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release tablet is contra indicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release tablets during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release tablets, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warning and Precautions ( 5 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 )and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and the 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablet was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (> 65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender ( 8.8 )]. Drug Interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Lovastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2 to 3% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Simvastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin's ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablet dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3. Lipid Response to Niacin Extended-release Tablets Therapy Mean Percent Change from Baseline to Week 16 Mean percent change from baseline for all niacin extended-release tablets doses was significantly different (p <0.05) from placebo. n = number of patients at baseline; Treatment n TC LDL - C HDL - C TG Apo B Niacin extended- release tablets, 1000 mg at bedtime 41 -3 -5 +18 -21 -6 Niacin extended- release tablets, 2000 mg at bedtime 41 -10 -14 +22 -28 -16 Placebo 40 0 -1 +4 0 +1 Niacin extended- release tablets, 1500 mg at bedtime 76 -8 -12 +20 -13 -12 Placebo 73 +2 +1 +2 +12 +1 In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablet dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2000 mg ( Table 4 ). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4. Lipid Response in Dose-Escalation Study Mean Percent Change from Baseline For all niacin extended-release tablets doses except 500 mg, mean percent change from baseline was significantly different (p<0.05) from placebo for all lipid parameters shown. n = number of patients enrolled; Treatment n TC LDL - C HDL - C TG Apo B Placebo Placebo data shown are after 24 weeks of placebo treatment. 44 -2 -1 +5 -6 -2 Niacin Extended- release Tablets 87 500 mg at bedtime -2 -3 +10 -5 -2 1000 mg at bedtime -5 -9 +15 -11 -7 1500 mg at bedtime -11 -14 +22 -28 -15 2000 mg at bedtime -12 -17 +26 -35 -16 Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below ( Table 5 ). Table 5. Selected Lipid Response to Niacin Extended-release Tablets in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies* Mean Baseline and Median Percent Change from Baseline ( 25 t h , 75 t h Percentiles ) *Represents pooled analyses of results; minimum duration on therapy at each dose was 4 weeks.

Results are shown below ( Table 7 ). Table 7.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. 1. Niacin extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. 2. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. 3. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. 4. Niacin extended-release tablets in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. 5. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release tablets did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Niacin extended-release tablets contain\u00ad extended-release niacin (nicotinic acid), and are indicated: To reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2.1 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. ( 2.1 ) Maintenance dose: 1000 to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing Niacin Extended-release Tablets, USP should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily Dose Niacin Extended-release Tablets Dosage INITIAL TITRATION SCHEDULE 1 to 4 500 mg 1 niacin extended-release tablet 500 mg at bedtime 5 to 8 1000 mg 1 niacin extended-release tablet 1000 mg or 2 niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 1500 mg 3 niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 2000 mg 2 niacin extended-release tablets 1000 mg or 4 niacin extended-release tablets 500 mg at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period and doses above 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. 2.2 Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4-week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Flushing of the skin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1 ), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1 ). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] ."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release tablets preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release tablets, therapy with niacin extended-release tablets should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release tablets dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Caution should also be used when niacin extended-release tablets are used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin extended-release tablets therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release tablets. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release tablets can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release tablets have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163-177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87-1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95-3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release tablets doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release tablets for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release tablets. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release tablets are administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets have been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Skeletal Muscle (rhabdomyolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Liver Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) Flushing of the skin may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to niacin extended-release tablets dose). ( 2.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21-75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release tablets and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release tablets controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release tablets. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release tablets patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release tablets. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release tablets. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Number of niacin extended-release tablets patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release tablets 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release tablets group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release tablets. Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias Eye disorders: blurred vision, macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: peptic ulcers, eructation, flatulence Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased glucose tolerance, gout Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, myopathy Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, paresthesia, migraine Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, dry skin, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, skin discoloration, acanthosis nigricans Vascular disorders: syncope, hypotension, postural hypotension Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases, LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time."

( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Bile Acid Sequestrants: Bile acid sequestrants have a high niacin-binding capacity and should be taken at least 4 to 6 hours before niacin extended-release tablets administration. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Statins Caution should be used when prescribing niacin (\u22651 gm/day) with statins as these drugs can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study results suggest that the bile acid-binding resins have high niacin binding capacity. Therefore, 4 to 6 hours, or as great an interval as possible, should elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and the administration of niacin extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. 7.4 Antihypertensive Therapy Niacin may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. 7.5 Other Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin extended-release tablets. 7.6 Laboratory Test Interactions Niacin may produce false elevations in some fluorometric determinations of plasma or urinary catecholamines. Niacin may also give false-positive reactions with cupric sulfate solution (Benedict\u2019s reagent) in urine glucose tests."

( 8.1 ) Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment. ( 8.2 ) Renal impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue niacin extended-release tablets when pregnancy is recognized in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Assess the individual risks and benefits of continuing niacin extended-release tablets during pregnancy in patients receiving the drug for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. The potential for embryofetal toxicity with the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets is unknown. The available data on niacin extended-release tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release tablets. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia for most patients. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Niacin is present in human milk and the amount of niacin increases with maternal supplementation. There is no information on the effects of the doses of niacin in niacin extended-release tablets on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, including hepatotoxicity, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release tablets, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release tablets. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release tablets with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release tablets administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60 to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (>65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release tablets are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender ( 8.8 )] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2-3% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release tablets increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release tablets bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10 to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-release Tablets Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release tablets dosed at 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo ( Table 3 ). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level (see Gender Effect , below). Table 3. Lipid Response to Niacin Extended-release Tablets Therapy Mean Percent Change from Baseline to Week 16 * Treatment n TC LDL-C HDL-C TG Apo B Niacin extended-release tablets 1000 mg at bedtime 41 -3 -5 +18 -21 -6 Niacin extended-release tablets 2000 mg at bedtime 41 -10 -14 +22 -28 -16 Placebo 40 0 -1 +4 0 +1 Niacin extended-release tablets 1500 mg at bedtime 76 -8 -12 +20 -13 -12 Placebo 73 +2 +1 +2 +12 +1 n = number of patients at baseline; * Mean percent change from baseline for all niacin extended-release tablets doses was significantly different ( p <0.05) from placebo. In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release tablets dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2000 mg ( Table 4 ). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release tablets than men (see Gender Effect , below). Table 4.

Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below ( Table 5 ). Table 5.

Gender Effect: Combined data from the three placebo-controlled niacin extended-release tablets studies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia suggest that, at each niacin extended-release tablets dose level studied, changes in lipid concentrations are greater for women than for men ( Table 6 ).

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release tablets (forced titration to 2000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u2264 40 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below ( Table 7 ). Table 7.

The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended. Tablet Integrity Niacin extended-release tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole. Dosing Interruption If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to restarting therapy; re-titration is recommended. Muscle Pain Notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician. Flushing Flushing (warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling of the skin) is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent niacin extended-release tablets use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Use of Aspirin Medication Taking aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release tablets to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy to discuss if niacin extended-release tablets should be discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Lactation Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with niacin extended-release tablets. Distributed by: Lannett Company, Inc.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What are niacin extended-release tablets? Niacin extended-release tablets are a prescription medicine used with diet and exercise to increase the good cholesterol (HDL) and lower the bad cholesterol (LDL) and fats (triglycerides) in your blood. Niacin extended-release tablets are also used to lower the risk of heart attack in people who have had a heart attack and have high cholesterol. In people with coronary artery disease and high cholesterol, niacin extended-release tablets, when used with a bile acid-binding resin (another cholesterol medicine) can slow down or lessen the build-up of plaque (fatty deposits) in your arteries. In people with heart problems and well-controlled cholesterol, taking niacin extended-release tablets with another cholesterol-lowering medicine (simvastatin) does not reduce heart attacks or strokes more than taking simvastatin alone.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Niacin extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. Niacin extended-release tablets in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Limitations of Use Addition of niacin extended-release tablets did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large, randomized controlled trial (AIM-HIGH) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Niacin extended-release tablets contain extended-release niacin (nicotinic acid), and are indicated: To reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack, and doses should be individualized according to patient response. Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily dose Niacin Extended-Release Tablets Dosage INITIAL TITRATION 1 to 4 500 mg 1 Niacin Extended-Release Tablet 500 mg at bedtime SCHEDULE 5 to 8 1000 mg 1 Niacin Extended-Release Tablet 1000 mg or 2 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 1500 mg 3 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg at bedtime * 2000 mg 2 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg or 4 Niacin Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of niacin extended-release tablets should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4\u2013week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower niacin extended-release tablets doses than men [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. Tolerance to flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of niacin and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Concomitant alcoholic, hot drinks or spicy foods may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided around the time of niacin extended-release tablets ingestion. Equivalent doses of niacin extended-release tablets should not be substituted for sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin preparations or immediate-release (crystalline) niacin [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Patients previously receiving other niacin products should be started with the recommended niacin extended-release tablets titration schedule (see Table 1), and the dose should subsequently be individualized based on patient response. If niacin extended-release tablets therapy is discontinued for an extended period, reinstitution of therapy should include a titration phase (see Table 1). Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken whole and should not be broken, crushed or chewed before swallowing. Dosage in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Use of niacin extended-release tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. Niacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. Niacin extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime with a low-fat snack. ( 2 ) Dose range: 500 mg to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2 ) Therapy with niacin extended-release tablets must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy and should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any four week period. ( 2 ) Maintenance dose: 1000 to 2000 mg once daily. ( 2 ) Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. ( 2 )"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Niacin extended-release preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to niacin extended-release, therapy with niacin extended-release should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg at bedtime) and the niacin extended-release dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Caution should also be used when niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Niacin is rapidly metabolized by the liver, and excreted through the kidneys. Niacin is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during niacin therapy. Severe hepatic toxicity has occurred in patients substituting sustained-release niacin for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. ( 5.3 ) Myopathy has been reported in patients taking niacin extended-release. The risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are increased among elderly patients; patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; and patients being treated with a statin. ( 5.2 ) Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI. ( 5 ) Niacin extended-release can increase serum glucose levels. Glucose levels should be closely monitored in diabetic or potentially diabetic patients particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity Niacin extended-release has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1500 to 2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Skeletal Muscle Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of niacin and statins. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. 5.3 Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release. Niacin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In three placebo-controlled clinical trials involving titration to final daily niacin extended-release doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg, 245 patients received niacin extended-release for a mean duration of 17 weeks. No patient with normal serum transaminase levels (AST, ALT) at baseline experienced elevations to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment with niacin extended-release. In these studies, fewer than 1% (2/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to transaminase elevations greater than 2 times the ULN. Liver-related tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with niacin extended-release. Serum transaminase levels, including AST and ALT (SGOT and SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 times ULN and are persistent, or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea, fever, and/or malaise, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities Increase in Blood Glucose: Niacin treatment can increase fasting blood glucose. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related increase in glucose intolerance. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely during treatment with niacin extended-release, particularly during the first few months of use or dose adjustment; adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Reduction in platelet count: Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count (mean of -11% with 2000 mg). Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Prothrombin Time (PT): Niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant increases in prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%); accordingly, patients undergoing surgery should be carefully evaluated. Caution should be observed when niacin extended-release is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time should be monitored closely in such patients. Increase in Uric Acid: Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Decrease in Phosphorus: In placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). Although these reductions were transient, phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and pruritus. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE, Inc. at 1-855-361-3993 or www.avkare.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release. Other adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients treated with niacin extended-release and at an incidence greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions by Dose Level in \u2265 5% of Patients and at an Incidence Greater than Placebo; Regardless of Causality Assessment in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Placebo-Controlled Studies Niacin Extended-release Treatment @ Recommended Daily Maintenance Doses \u2020 Placebo (n = 157) 500 mg \u2021 (n = 87) 1000 mg (n = 110) 1500 mg (n = 136) 2000 mg (n = 95) % % % % % Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 13 7 10 10 14 Nausea 7 5 6 4 11 Vomiting 4 0 2 4 9 Respiratory Cough, Increased 6 3 2 < 2 8 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Pruritus 2 8 0 3 0 Rash 0 5 5 5 0 Vascular Disorders Flushing & 19 68 69 63 55 Note: Percentages are calculated from the total number of patients in each column. \u2020 Adverse reactions are reported at the initial dose where they occur. @ Pooled results from placebo-controlled studies; for niacin extended-release, n = 245 and median treatment duration = 16 weeks. Number of niacin patients (n) are not additive across doses. \u2021 The 500 mg/day dose is outside the recommended daily maintenance dosing range [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . & 10 patients discontinued before receiving 500 mg, therefore they were not included. In general, the incidence of adverse events was higher in women compared to men. Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) In AIM-HIGH involving 3414 patients (mean age of 64 years, 15% women, 92% Caucasians, 34% with diabetes mellitus) with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, all patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1500 to 2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 to 150 mg, n=1696). The incidence of the adverse reactions of \u201cblood glucose increased\u201d (6.4% vs. 4.5%) and \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d (3.6% vs. 2.2%) was significantly higher in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group as compared to the simvastatin plus placebo group. There were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis reported, 4 (0.2%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and one (<0.1%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of niacin extended-release: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, tongue edema, larynx edema, face edema, peripheral edema, laryngismus, and vesiculobullous rash; maculopapular rash; dry skin; tachycardia; palpitations; atrial fibrillation; other cardiac arrhythmias; syncope; hypotension; postural hypotension; blurred vision; macular edema; peptic ulcers; eructation; flatulence; hepatitis; jaundice; decreased glucose tolerance; gout; myalgia; myopathy; dizziness; insomnia; asthenia; nervousness; paresthesia; dyspnea; sweating; burning sensation/skin burning sensation; skin discoloration, and migraine. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Chemistry: Elevations in serum transaminases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] , LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total bilirubin, amylase and creatine kinase, and reduction in phosphorus. Hematology: Slight reductions in platelet counts and prolongation in prothrombin time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Statins: Caution should be used when prescribing niacin with statins as these agents can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Bile Acid Sequestrants: Bile acid sequestrants have a high niacin-binding capacity and should be taken at least 4 to 6 hours before niacin extended-release administration. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Statins Caution should be used when prescribing niacin (\u22651 gm/day) with statins as these drugs can increase risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study results suggest that the bile acid-binding resins have high niacin binding capacity. Therefore, 4 to 6 hours, or as great an interval as possible, should elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and the administration of niacin extended-release [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. 7.4 Antihypertensive Therapy Niacin may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. 7.5 Other Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin extended-release. 7.6 Laboratory Test Interactions Niacin may produce false elevations in some fluorometric determinations of plasma or urinary catecholamines. Niacin may also give false-positive reactions with cupric sulfate solution (Benedict\u2019s reagent) in urine glucose tests."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal impairment: Niacin extended- release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. ( 5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Niacin extended-release is contraindicated in active liver disease or significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction or unexplained elevations of serum transaminases. ( 4 , 5 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extended-release. It is also not known whether niacin at doses typically used for lipid disorders can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. If a woman receiving niacin for primary hyperlipidemia becomes pregnant, the drug should be discontinued. If a woman being treated with niacin for hypertriglyceridemia conceives, the benefits and risks of continued therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Niacin is excreted into human milk but the actual infant dose or infant dose as a percent of the maternal dose is not known. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from lipid-altering doses of nicotinic acid, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. No studies have been conducted with niacin extended-release in nursing mothers. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of niacin therapy in pediatric patients (\u226416 years) have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 979 patients in clinical studies of niacin extended-release, 21% of the patients were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with a past history of liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications (4.0) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.8 Gender Data from the clinical trials suggest that women have a greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extended-release."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Niacin extended-release tablets contains niacin, USP, which at therapeutic doses is an antihyperlipidemic agent. Niacin, USP (nicotinic acid, or 3-pyridinecarboxylic acid) is a white, crystalline powder, very soluble in water, with the following structural formula: Niacin extended-release tablets are unscored, film-coated tablets for oral administration and are available in two tablet strengths containing 500 mg and 1000 mg niacin. The 500 mg is light orange to orange colored, round shaped, coated tablets debossed with \u2018AN 321\u2019 on one side and plain on the other side. The 1000 mg is light orange to orange colored, capsule shaped, coated tablets debossed with \u2018AN 323\u2019 on one side and plain on the other side. Niacin extended-release tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients: FD&C yellow #6/sunset yellow FCF aluminum lake, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, polyethylene glycol 400, stearic acid and titanium dioxide. 4097803e-figure-01"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent. Metabolism The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release administration. Nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity; the activity of the other metabolites is unknown. Elimination Following single and multiple doses, approximately 60% to 76% of the niacin dose administered as niacin extended-release was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 12% was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered. Pediatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (\u226416 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Geriatric Use No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population (> 65 years) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Niacin extended-release should be used with caution in patients with renal disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population. Active liver disease, unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extended-release [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Gender Steady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. This gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders [see Gender (8.8) ] . Drug interactions Fluvastatin Niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Lovastatin When niacin extended-release 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased lovastatin C max and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid C max and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% to 3% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Simvastatin When niacin extended-release 2000 mg and simvastatin 40 mg were co-administered, niacin extended-release increased simvastatin C max and AUC by 1% and 9%, respectively, and simvastatin acid C max and AUC by 2% and 18%, respectively. Simvastatin reduced niacin extended-release bioavailability by 2% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Bile Acid Sequestrants An in vitro study was carried out investigating the niacin-binding capacity of colestipol and cholestyramine. About 98% of available niacin was bound to colestipol, with 10% to 30% binding to cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies Niacin\u2019s ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo ( p <0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52% versus 58.2%; p =0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and niacin therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary, per-subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After 2 years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (n=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (n=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered ( p <0.005); disease regression also occurred more frequently in the drug-treated group (16.2% versus 2.4%; p =0.002). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for 4 years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p <0.0001). The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with Apo B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL-C was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or niacin plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11%. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the niacin plus colestipol group, while regression was observed in 39%. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, MI, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received niacin plus colestipol. 14.2 Niacin Extended-Release Clinical Studies Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: In two randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials, niacin extended-release dosed at 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg daily at bedtime with a low-fat snack for 16 weeks (including 4 weeks of dose escalation) favorably altered lipid profiles compared to placebo (Table 3). Women appeared to have a greater response than men at each niacin extended-release dose level (see Gender Effect , below). In a double-blind, multi-center, forced dose-escalation study, monthly 500 mg increases in niacin extended-release dose resulted in incremental reductions of approximately 5% in LDL-C and Apo B levels in the daily dose range of 500 mg through 2000 mg (Table 4). Women again tended to have a greater response to niacin extended-release than men (see Gender Effect , below). Pooled results for major lipids from these three placebo-controlled studies are shown below (Table 5). Table 5.

Gender Effect: Combined data from the three placebo-controlled niacin extended-release studies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia suggest that, at each niacin extended-release dose level studied, changes in lipid concentrations are greater for women than for men (Table 6).

Other Patient Populations: In a double-blind, multi-center, 19-week study the lipid-altering effects of niacin extended-release (forced titration to 2000 mg at bedtime) were compared to baseline in patients whose primary lipid abnormality was a low level of HDL-C (HDL-C \u226440 mg/dL, TG \u2264400 mg/dL, and LDL-C \u2264160, or <130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD). Results are shown below (Table 7). At niacin extended-release 2000 mg/day, median changes from baseline (25th, 75th percentiles) for LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were -3% (-14, +12%), +27% (+13, +38%), and -33% (-50, -19%), respectively. 3 4 7"

Patients should be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking niacin extended-release. The patient should be informed of the following: Dosing Time Niacin extended-release tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended.

However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications. Advise patients of the symptoms of flushing and how they differ from the symptoms of a myocardial infarction. Diet Avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking niacin extended-release to minimize flushing. Supplements Notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide. Dizziness Notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur. Diabetics If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The role of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in atherogenesis is supported by pathological observations, clinical studies, and many animal experiments. Observational epidemiological studies have clearly established that high total or LDL cholesterol and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are risk factors for coronary heart disease. The Coronary Drug Project 1 , completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of nicotinic acid and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). Over an observation period of five years, nicotinic acid showed a statistically significant benefit in decreasing nonfatal, recurrent myocardial infarctions. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo (p< 0.004). Though total mortality was similar in the two groups at five years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p = N.S.), in a fifteen year cumulative follow-up there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the nicotinic acid group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p= 0.0004) 2 . The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and nicotinic acid therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery 3 . The primary, per subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After two years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (N=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (N=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered (p<0.005). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for four years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p< 0.0001) 4 . The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with apolipoprotein B levels \u2265125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography 5 . Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL cholesterol was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or nicotinic acid plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the nicotinic acid plus colestipol group. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received nicotinic acid plus colestipol. Nicotinic acid (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses produces an average 10% to 20% reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, a 30% to 70% reduction in triglycerides, and an average 20% to 35% increase in HDL cholesterol. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in total HDL is associated with a shift in the distribution of HDL sub-fractions (as defined by ultra-centrifugation) with an increase in the HDL 2 :HDL 3 ratio and an increase in apolipoprotein A-I content. The mechanism by which nicotinic acid exerts these effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Nicotinic acid treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. The effect of nicotinic acid-induced changes in lipids/lipoproteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without pre-existing coronary disease has not been established. Pharmacokinetics Following an oral dose, the pharmacokinetic profile of nicotinic acid is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short plasma elimination half-life. At a 1 gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 \u00b5g/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE I. Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Nicotinic acid, alone or in combination with a bile-acid binding resin, is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb) \u2020 , when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also the NCEP treatment guidelines 6 ). Prior to initiating therapy with nicotinic acid, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. II. Nicotinic acid is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia)\u2020 who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum triglyceride levels over 2,000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia) \u2020 . Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1,000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop pancreatitis. Therapy with nicotinic acid may be considered for those subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. Some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1,000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of nicotinic acid therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL. Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia 7 . \u2020 Classification of Hyperlipoproteinemias Lipoproteins Lipid Elevations Type Elevated Major Minor C = cholesterol, TG = triglycerides LDL = low-density lipoprotein VLDL = very low-density lipoprotein IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein I (rare) Chylomicrons TG \u2191\u2192 C IIa LDL C .....

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Liver Dysfunction Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid products for immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid at equivalent doses. Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with nicotinic acid. Serum transaminase levels, including ALT (SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every six weeks to twelve weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6 month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to three times the upper limit of normal and are persistent, the drug should be discontinued. Liver biopsy should be considered if elevations persist beyond discontinuation of the drug. Nicotinic acid should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of nicotinic acid. Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (\u22651 g/day) of nicotinic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Physicians contemplating combined therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and nicotinic acid should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Periodic serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and potassium determinations should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Before instituting therapy with nicotinic acid, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ]. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during nicotinic acid therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary. Caution should also be used when nicotinic acid is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with nicotinic acid therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Drug Interactions HMG\u2011CoA Reductase Inhibitors See WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle . Antihypertensive Therapy Nicotinic acid may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension. Aspirin Concomitant aspirin may decrease the metabolic clearance of nicotinic acid. The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. Other Concomitant alcohol or hot drinks may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided at the time of drug ingestion. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Nicotinic acid administered to mice for a lifetime as a 1% solution in drinking water was not carcinogenic. The mice in this study received approximately 6 to 8 times a human dose of 3,000 milligrams/day as determined on a milligram/square meter basis. Nicotinic acid was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames test. No studies on impairment of fertility have been performed. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nicotinic acid. It is also not known whether nicotinic acid at doses typically used for lipid disorders can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. If a woman receiving nicotinic acid for primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa or IIb) becomes pregnant, the drug should be discontinued. If a woman being treated with nicotinic acid for hypertriglyceridemia (Types IV or V) conceives, the benefits and risks of continued drug therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from lipid-altering doses of nicotinic acid, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children and adolescents have not been established."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The usual adult dosage of nicotinic acid is 1 to 2 grams two or three times a day. Doses should be individualized according to the patient's response. Start with one-half tablet (250 mg) as a single daily dose following the evening meal. The frequency of dosing and total daily dose can be increased every four to seven days until the desired LDL cholesterol and/or triglyceride level is achieved or the first-level therapeutic dose of 1.5 to 2 grams/day is reached. If the patient's hyperlipidemia is not adequately controlled after 2 months at this level, the dosage can then be increased at two to four week intervals to 3 grams/day (1 gram three times per day). In patients with marked lipid abnormalities, a higher dose is occasionally required, but generally should not exceed 6 grams/day. Flushing of the skin appears frequently and can be minimized by pretreatment with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tolerance to this flushing develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. Flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of nicotinic acid and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. Sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid preparations should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid."
