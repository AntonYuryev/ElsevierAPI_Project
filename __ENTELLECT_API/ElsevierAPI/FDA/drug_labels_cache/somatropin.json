NORDITROPIN should be clear and colorless. If the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter do not use. \u2022 Instructions for delivering the dosage are provided in the PATIENT INFORMATION and INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE leaflets enclosed with the NORDITROPIN FlexPro prefilled pen. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage \u2022 Individualize dosage for each patient based on the growth response. \u2022 Divide the calculated weekly NORDITROPIN dosage into equal doses given either 6, or 7 days per week. \u2022 The recommended weekly dose in milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight for pediatric patients is: o Pediatric GH Deficiency: 0.17 mg/kg/week to 0.24 mg/kg/week (0.024 to 0.034 mg/kg/day) o Noonan Syndrome: Up to 0.46 mg/kg/week (up to 0.066 mg/kg/day) o Turner Syndrome: Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day) o Small for Gestational Age (SGA): Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day) \u2022 In very short pediatric patients, HSDS less than -3, and older pubertal pediatric patients consider initiating treatment with a larger dose of NORDITROPIN (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day). Consider a gradual reduction in dosage if substantial catch-up growth is observed during the first few years of therapy. In pediatric patients less than 4 years of age with less severe short stature, baseline HSDS values between -2 and -3, consider initiating treatment at 0.033 mg/kg/day and titrate the dose as needed. o Idiopathic Short Stature: Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day) o Prader-Willi Syndrome: 0.24 mg/kg/week (0.034 mg/kg/day) \u2022 Assess compliance and evaluate other causes of poor growth such as hypothyroidism, under-nutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human growth hormone if patients experience failure to increase height velocity, particularly during the first year of treatment. \u2022 Discontinue NORDITROPIN for stimulation of linear growth once epiphyseal fusion has occurred [see Contraindications (4) ]. 2.3 Adult Dosage \u2022 Patients who were treated with somatropin for GH deficiency in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin for GH deficient adults. \u2022 Consider using a lower starting dose and smaller dose increment increases for geriatric patients as they may be at increased risk for adverse reactions with NORDITROPIN than younger individuals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. \u2022 Estrogen-replete women and patients receiving oral estrogen may require higher doses [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. \u2022 Administer the prescribed dose daily. \u2022 Either of two NORDITROPIN dosing regimens may be used: o Non-weight based \u2022 Initiate NORDITROPIN with a dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15 mg/day to 0.3 mg/day) and increase the dose every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 mg/day to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations. \u2022 Decrease the dose as necessary on the basis of adverse reactions and/or serum IGF-1 concentrations above the age- and gender-specific normal range. \u2022 Maintenance dosages will vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients. o Weight-based \u2022 Initiate NORDITROPIN at 0.004 mg/kg daily and increase the dose according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.016 mg/kg daily. \u2022 Use the patient\u2019s clinical response, adverse reactions, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-1 concentrations as guidance in dose titration. \u2022 Not recommended for obese patients as they are more likely to experience adverse reactions with this regimen"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Increased Risk of Neoplasms : Second neoplasms have occurred in childhood cancer survivors. Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus : NORDITROPIN may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving NORDITROPIN, especially in patients with existing diabetes mellitus or at risk for development. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Intracranial Hypertension (IH) : Has been reported usually within 8 weeks of initiation. Perform fundoscopic examinations prior to initiation and periodically thereafter. If papilledema occurs, stop treatment. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Severe Hypersensitivity : Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Fluid Retention : May occur in adults and may be dose dependent. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hypoadrenalism : Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism : Monitor thyroid function periodically as hypothyroidism may occur or worsen after initiation of somatropin. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients : May occur; evaluate patients with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients : Monitor patients with scoliosis for progression. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Pancreatitis : Has been reported; consider pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain, especially pediatric patients. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4) ]. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing NORDITROPIN treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. NORDITROPIN is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults. 5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with NORDITROPIN, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with NORDITROPIN should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.3 Increased Risk of Neoplasms Active Malignancy There is an increased risk of malignancy progression with somatropin treatment in patients with active malignancy [See Contraindications (4) ]. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with NORDITROPIN. Discontinue NORDITROPIN if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Risk of Second Neoplasm in Pediatric Patients There is an increased risk of a second neoplasm in pediatric cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head and who developed subsequent GH deficiency and were treated with somatropin. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence. Monitor all patients receiving NORDITROPIN who have a history of GH deficiency secondary to an intracranial neoplasm for progression or recurrence of the tumor. New Malignancy During Treatment Because pediatric patients with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting NORDITROPIN in these patients. If NORDITROPIN is initiated, carefully monitor patients for development of neoplasms. Monitor all patients receiving NORDITROPIN carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. Advise patients/caregivers to report marked changes in behavior, onset of headaches, vision disturbances and/or changes in skin pigmentation or changes in the appearance of pre-existing nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. New onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving NORDITROPIN, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely. The doses of antidiabetic agents may require adjustment when NORDITROPIN is initiated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropins. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with NORDITROPIN to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with NORDITROPIN can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of NORDITROPIN treatment. Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to NORDITROPIN, in particular, the growth response in pediatric patients. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GH deficiency and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin, including NORDITROPIN. Evaluate pediatric patients receiving NORDITROPIN with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain for slipped capital femoral epiphysis and osteonecrosis and manage accordingly . 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Somatropin increases the growth rate, and progression of existing scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for progression of scoliosis. 5.12 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in pediatric patients and adults receiving somatropin products. There may be a greater risk in pediatric patients compared with adults. Published literature indicates that females who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other pediatric patients receiving somatropin products. Pancreatitis should be considered in patients who develop persistent severe abdominal pain. 5.13 Lipoatrophy When somatropin products are administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering NORDITROPIN to reduce this risk [see Administration and Use Instructions (2.1) ]. 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase after NORDITROPIN treatment."

Pediatric Patients Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone In one randomized, open label, clinical study the most frequent adverse reactions were headache, pharyngitis, otitis media and fever. There were no clinically significant differences between the three doses assessed in the study (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day). Short Stature Associated with Noonan Syndrome NORDITROPIN was studied in 21 pediatric patients, 3 years to 14 years of age at doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day and 0.066 mg/kg/day. After the two-year study, patients continued NORDITROPIN treatment until final height was achieved; randomized dose groups were not maintained. Adverse reactions were later collected retrospectively from 18 pediatric patients; total follow-up was 11 years. An additional 6 pediatric patients were not randomized, but followed the protocol and are included in this assessment of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions were upper respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and influenza. Cardiac disorders was the system organ class with the second most adverse reactions reported. Scoliosis was reported in 1 and 4 pediatric patients receiving doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day and 0.066 mg/kg/day respectively. The following additional adverse reactions also occurred once: insulin resistance and panic reaction for the 0.033 mg/kg/day dose group; injection site pruritus, bone development abnormal, depression, and self-injurious ideation in the 0.066 mg/kg/day dose group. Headache occurred in 2 cases in the 0.066 mg/kg/day dose group. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies in pediatric patients that were treated until final height with various doses of NORDITROPIN, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were influenza-like illness, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis externa, gastroenteritis, eczema and, impaired fasting glucose. Adverse reactions in study 1 were most frequent in the highest dose groups. Three patients in study 1 had excessive growth of hands and/or feet in the high dose groups. Two patients in study 1 had a serious adverse reaction of exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis in the 0.045 mg/kg/day group. Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2-4 Years In a study, 53 pediatric patients were treated with 2 doses of NORDITROPIN (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) to final height for up to 13 years (mean duration of treatment 7.9 and 9.5 years for girls and boys, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were influenza-like illness, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, otitis media, pharyngitis, arthralgia, headache, gynecomastia, and increased sweating. One pediatric patient treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day for 4 years was reported with disproportionate growth of the lower jaw, and another patient treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day developed a melanocytic nevus. 4 pediatric patients treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day and 2 pediatric patients treated with 0.033 mg/kg/day of NORDITROPIN had increased fasting blood glucose levels after 1 year of treatment. In addition, small increases in mean fasting blood glucose and insulin levels after 1 and 2 years of NORDITROPIN treatment appeared to be dose-dependent. In a second study, 98 Japanese pediatric patients were treated with 2 doses of NORDITROPIN (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) for 2 years or were untreated for 1 year. Adverse reactions were otitis media, arthralgia and impaired glucose tolerance. Arthralgia and transiently impaired glucose tolerance were reported in the 0.067 mg/kg/day treatment group. Idiopathic Short Stature In two open-label clinical studies with another somatropin product in pediatric patients, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia. Growth Failure Due to Prader-Willi Syndrome In two clinical studies in pediatric patients with PWS carried out with another somatropin product, the following adverse reactions were reported: edema, aggressiveness, arthralgia, benign intracranial hypertension, hair loss, headache, and myalgia.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with NORDITROPIN and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 2: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with NORDITROPIN Glucocorticoids Clinical Impact: Microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. NORDITROPIN inhibits 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of NORDITROPIN may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Intervention: Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of NORDITROPIN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Examples: Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be effected more than others since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Clinical Impact: Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of NORDITROPIN in pediatric patients. Intervention: Carefully adjust glucocorticoid replacement dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Clinical Impact: Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. NORDITROPIN may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Intervention: Careful monitoring is advisable when NORDITROPIN is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Oral Estrogen Clinical Impact: Oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to NORDITROPIN. Intervention: Patients receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater NORDITROPIN dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents Clinical Impact: Treatment with NORDITROPIN may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Intervention: Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. \u2022 Glucocorticoids : Patients treated with glucocorticoid for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of NORDITROPIN ( 7 ) \u2022 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment : Adjust glucocorticoid replacement dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. ( 7 ) \u2022 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs : NORDITROPIN may alter the clearance. Monitor carefully if used with NORDITROPIN ( 7 ) \u2022 Oral Estrogen : Larger doses of NORDITROPIN may be required ( 7 ) \u2022 Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents : Dose adjustment of insulin or hypoglycemic agent may be required ( 5.4 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with somatropin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal or neonatal harm when pregnant rats were administered subcutaneous NORDITROPIN during organogenesis or during lactation at doses approximately 10-times higher than the maximal clinical dose of 0.016 mg/kg, based on body surface area (see Data). The estimated background risk of birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study, NORDITROPIN was administered via subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats from gestation Day 6 to 17, corresponding with the period of organogenesis. NORDITROPIN did not adversely affect fetal viability or developmental outcomes at maternal doses that were approximately 10-times the clinical dose of 0.016 mg/kg, based on body surface area. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats, NORDITROPIN was administered from gestation Day 17 through lactation Day 21 (weaning). No adverse developmental effects were observed in the offspring at doses up to 1.1 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the clinical dose of 0.016 mg/kg, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of somatropin in human milk. Limited published data indicate that exogenous somatropin does not increase normal breastmilk concentrations of growth hormone. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant have been reported with somatropin. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for NORDITROPIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NORDITROPIN or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN in pediatric patients have been established in growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone, short stature associated with Noonan syndrome, short stature associated with Turner syndrome, short stature in children born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by age 2 years to 4 years of age, idiopathic short stature (ISS), and growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, dose-response study in 111 pediatric patients conducted for a two-year period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Short Stature Associated with Noonan Syndrome Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with Noonan syndrome in a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 21 pediatric patients conducted for 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with short stature associated with Turner syndrome in two randomized, parallel group, open-label, multicenter studies in 87 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Short Stature in Pediatric Patients Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2 Years to 4 Years of Age Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with short stature born SGA with no catch-up growth in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, two-arm study to final height in 53 pediatric patients and in a randomized study of 84 prepubertal, non-GHD, Japanese pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with ISS based on data from a randomized, open-label clinical study with another somatropin product in 105 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Growth Failure Due to Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) Safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with growth failure due to Prader-Willi Syndrome based on data from two randomized, open label, controlled clinical trials with another somatropin product in pediatric patients. There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of NORDITROPIN in patients aged 65 and over has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin binds to dimeric GH receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells. This interaction results in intracellular signal transduction and subsequent induction of transcription and translation of GH-dependent proteins including IGF-1, IGF BP-3 and acid-labile subunit. Somatropin has direct tissue and metabolic effects or mediated indirectly by IGF-1, including stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation, and proliferation, stimulation hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis and lipolysis. Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the growth plates (epiphyses) of long bones. The stimulation of skeletal growth increases linear growth rate (height velocity) in most somatropin-treated pediatric patients. Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects (n=26) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone results in an increased mean (SD) IGF-1 level from 190 (46) ng/mL predose to maximal level of 276 (49) ng/mL after approx. 24 hours. After 96 hours, the subjects displayed a mean (SD) IGF-1 concentration of 196 (41) ng/mL, comparable to the predose value. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Somatropin has been studied following subcutaneous and intravenous administration in adult healthy subjects and GHD patients. A single dose administration of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects (n=26) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone resulted in a mean (SD) C max of 34.9 (10.4) ng/mL after approximately 3.0 hours. After a 180-min IV infusion of NORDITROPIN (33 ng/kg/min) administered to GHD patients (n=9), a mean (SD) hGH steady state serum level of approximately 23.1 (15.0) ng/mL was reached at 150 min. After a SC dose of 0.024 mg/kg or 3 IU/m 2 given in the thigh to adult GHD patients (n=18), mean (SD) C max values of 13.8 (5.8) and 17.1 (10.0) ng/mL were observed for the 4 and 8 mg NORDITROPIN vials, respectively, at approximately 4 to 5 hr. post dose. The absolute bioavailability for NORDITROPIN after the SC route of administration is currently not known. Distribution \u2014 The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution of somatropin after single dose subcutaneous administration of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects is 43.9 (14.9) L. Elimination Metabolism \u2014 Extensive metabolism studies have not been conducted. The metabolic fate of somatropin involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. Excretion \u2013 The mean apparent terminal T 1/2 values in healthy adult subjects (n=26) was 2.0 (0.5) hours. In GHD patients receiving 180-min IV infusion of NORDITROPIN (33 ng/kg/min), a mean clearance rate of approximately 2.3 (1.8) mL/min/kg or 139 (105) mL/min for hGH was observed. Following infusion, serum hGH levels had a biexponential decay with a terminal elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of approximately 21.1 (5.1) min. The mean apparent terminal T 1/2 values in GHD patients receiving a SC dose of 0.024 mg/kg or 3 IU/m 2 was estimated to be approximately 7 to 10 hr. The longer half-life observed after subcutaneous administration is due to slow absorption from the injection site. Urinary excretion of intact somatropin has not been measured. Geriatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of somatropin have not been studied in patients greater than 65 years of age. Pediatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of somatropin in pediatric patients are similar to those of adults. Male and Female Patients \u2014 No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with somatropin. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment \u2014 No studies have been performed with somatropin. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of NORDITROPIN or other somatropins. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed. In clinical trials, GH deficient pediatric patients receiving NORDITROPIN for up to 12 months were tested for induction of antibodies, and 0 of 358 patients developed antibodies with binding capacities above 2 mg/L. Amongst these patients, 165 had previously been treated with other somatropin formulations, and 193 were previously untreated naive patients. Eighteen of 76 children (~24%) treated with NORDITROPIN for short stature born SGA developed anti-rhGH antibodies."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin binds to dimeric GH receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells. This interaction results in intracellular signal transduction and subsequent induction of transcription and translation of GH-dependent proteins including IGF-1, IGF BP-3 and acid-labile subunit. Somatropin has direct tissue and metabolic effects or mediated indirectly by IGF-1, including stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation, and proliferation, stimulation hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis and lipolysis. Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the growth plates (epiphyses) of long bones. The stimulation of skeletal growth increases linear growth rate (height velocity) in most somatropin-treated pediatric patients. Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Somatropin has been studied following subcutaneous and intravenous administration in adult healthy subjects and GHD patients. A single dose administration of 4 mg NORDITROPIN in healthy subjects (n=26) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone resulted in a mean (SD) C max of 34.9 (10.4) ng/mL after approximately 3.0 hours. After a 180-min IV infusion of NORDITROPIN (33 ng/kg/min) administered to GHD patients (n=9), a mean (SD) hGH steady state serum level of approximately 23.1 (15.0) ng/mL was reached at 150 min. After a SC dose of 0.024 mg/kg or 3 IU/m 2 given in the thigh to adult GHD patients (n=18), mean (SD) C max values of 13.8 (5.8) and 17.1 (10.0) ng/mL were observed for the 4 and 8 mg NORDITROPIN vials, respectively, at approximately 4 to 5 hr. post dose. The absolute bioavailability for NORDITROPIN after the SC route of administration is currently not known.

In a rat study evaluating female fertility, animals were administered once daily subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.1 mg/kg NORDITROPIN beginning two weeks prior to mating, throughout mating and during the first 7 days of pregnancy. Delays in the time to mating were observed at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the maximum adult clinical dose of 0.016 mg/kg, based on body surface area), but these doses were also associated with increases in the number of corpora lutea and implantations. A decrease in the pregnancy rate was observed at the dose of 1.1 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the clinical dose of 0.016 mg/kg, based on body surface area). Male fertility parameters have not been evaluated with administration of NORDITROPIN."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone The efficacy and safety of NORDITROPIN was assessed in a multicenter, prospective randomized, open label, dose response study with three doses (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day). A total of 111 pediatric patients with GH deficiency were randomized to each dose; 37(0.025 mg/kg/day):38(0.05 mg/kg/day):36(0.1 mg/kg/day). Patients met the following entry criteria: chronological age \u2265 3 years with a skeletal age < 10 years if male and < 8 years if female; pubertal stage = stage 1; previously untreated GH deficiency; peak plasma hormone concentration < 7 ng/ml or < 10 ng/ml (depending on assay used) in two tests. The results are displayed in Table 4 . The adjusted mean increases in HSDS over the 2-year period were 0.81, 1.57 and 1.73 in the 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in \u0394HSDS between the 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day treatment groups. Height velocity (HV, cm/year) and HVSDS increased considerably after initiation of treatment, with the greatest response observed during the first year of treatment.

Additional 6 children were not randomized, but did follow the protocol. Inclusion criteria included bone age determination showing no significant acceleration, prepubertal status, height SDS <-2, and HV SDS <1 during the 12 months pre-treatment. Exclusion criteria were previous or ongoing treatment with growth hormone, anabolic steroids or corticosteroids, congenital heart disease or other serious disease perceived to possibly have major impact on growth, FPG >6.7 mmol/L (>120 mg/dL), or growth hormone deficiency (peak GH levels <10 ng/mL). The twenty-four, 12 female and 12 male, patients 3 \u2013 14 years of age received either 0.033 mg/kg/day or 0.066 mg/kg/day of NORDITROPIN subcutaneously which was adjusted based on growth response after the first 2 years. After the initial two-year study, NORDITROPIN treatment continued until final height. Retrospective final height was collected from 18 patients in the study and the 6 who had followed the protocol without randomization. Historical reference materials of height velocity and adult height analyses of Noonan patients served as the controls. Patients obtained a final height (FH) gain from baseline of 1.5 and 1.6 SDS estimated according to the national and the Noonan reference, respectively. A height gain of 1.5 SDS (national) corresponds to a mean height gain of 9.9 cm in boys and 9.1 cm in girls at 18 years of age, while a height gain of 1.6 SDS (Noonan) corresponds to a mean height gain of 11.5 cm in boys and 11.0 cm in girls at 18 years of age. A comparison of HV between the two treatment groups during the first two years of treatment for the randomized subjects was 10.1 and 7.6 cm/year with 0.066 mg/kg/day versus 8.55 and 6.7 cm/year with 0.033 mg/kg/day, for Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. 14.3 Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome Two randomized, parallel group, open label, multicenter studies were conducted in the Netherlands to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NORDITROPIN. Patients were treated to final height in both studies [height velocity (HV) < 2 cm/year]. Changes in height were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) utilizing reference data for untreated Turner syndrome patients as well as the national Dutch population. In Study 1, 68 euthyroid Caucasian patients stratified based on age and baseline height SDS were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to three different NORDITROPIN treatment regimens: 0.045 mg/kg/day (Dose A) for the entire study; 0.045 mg/kg/day for the first year and 0.067 mg/kg/day thereafter (Dose B); or 0.045 mg/kg/day for the first year, 0.067 for the second year, and 0.089 mg/kg/day thereafter (Dose C). At baseline, mean age was 6.5 years, mean height SDS (National standard) was -2.7, and mean HV during the previous year was 6.5 cm/year. Patients also received estrogen therapy after age 12 and following four years of NORDITROPIN treatment if they did not have spontaneous puberty. Patients were treated for a mean of 8.4 years. As seen in Table 5 , overall mean final height was 161 cm in the 46 children who attained final height. Seventy percent of these children reached a final height within the normal range (height SDS > -2 using the National standard). A greater percentage of children in the two escalated dose groups reached normal final height. The mean changes from baseline to final height in height SDS after treatment with Dose B and Dose C were significantly greater than the mean changes observed after treatment with Dose A (utilizing both the National and Turner standards). The mean changes from baseline to final height in height SDS (Turner standard) in Table 5 correspond to mean height gains of 9.4, 14.1 and 14.4 cm after treatment with Doses A, B and C, respectively. The mean changes from baseline to final height in height SDS (National standard) in Table 5 correspond to mean height gains of 4.5, 9.1 and 9.4 cm after treatment with Doses A, B and C, respectively. In each treatment group, peak HV was observed during treatment Year 1, and then gradually decreased each year; during Year 4, HV was less than the pre-treatment HV. However, between Year 2 and Year 6, a greater HV was observed in the two dose escalation groups compared to the 0.045 mg/kg/day group.

All subjects were treated with concomitant ethinyl estradiol. Overall, at baseline, mean age was 13.6 years, mean height SDS (National standard) was -3.5 and mean HV during the previous year was 4.3 cm/year. Patients were treated for a mean of 3.6 years. In that there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any linear growth variables, the data from all patients were pooled. Overall mean final height was 155 cm in the 17 children who attained final height. Height SDS changed significantly from -3.5 at baseline to -2.4 at final height (National standard), and from 0.7 to 1.3 at final height (Turner standard). 14.4 Short Stature in Pediatric Patients Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2-4 Years A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, two-arm study to final height (Study 1) and a 2-year, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study (Study 2) were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of NORDITROPIN. Changes in height and height velocity were compared to a national reference population in both studies. Study 1 included 53, 38 male, 15 female, non-GHD, Dutch prepubertal pediatric patients 3-11 years of age with short stature born SGA with no catch-up growth. Catch-up growth was defined as obtaining a height of \u2265 3 rd percentile within the first 2 years of life or at a later stage. Inclusion criteria included: birth length < 3 rd percentile for gestational age, and height velocity (cm/year) for chronological age < 50 th percentile. Exclusion criteria included chromosomal abnormalities, signs of a syndrome (except for Silver-Russell syndrome), serious/chronic co-morbid disease, malignancy, and previous rhGH therapy. NORDITROPIN was administered subcutaneously daily at bedtime at a dose of approximately 0.033 (Dose A) or 0.067 mg/kg/day (Dose B) for the entire treatment period. Final height was defined as a height velocity below 2 cm/year. Treatment with NORDITROPIN was continued to final height for up to 13 years. Mean duration of treatment was 9.5 years (boys) and 7.9 years (girls). 38 out of 53 children (72%) reached final height. Sixty-three percent (24 out of 38) of the children who reached final height were within the normal range of their healthy peers (Dutch national reference). For both doses combined, actual mean final height was 171 (SD 6.1) cm in boys and 159 (SD 4.3) cm in girls. As seen in Table 6 , for boys and girls combined, both mean final height SDS, and increase in height SDS from baseline to final height, were significantly greater after treatment with Dose B (0.067 mg/kg/day). A similar dose response was observed for the increase in height SDS from baseline to Year 2 ( Table 6 ). Overall mean height velocity at baseline was 5.4 cm/y (SD 1.2; n=29). Height velocity was greatest during the first year of NORDITROPIN treatment and was significantly greater after treatment with Dose B (mean 11.1 cm/y [SD 1.9; n=19]) compared with Dose A (mean 9.7 cm/y [SD 1.3; n=10]).

Additional inclusion criteria included birth length or weight SDS \u2264 -2 or < 10 th percentile for gestational age, height SDS for chronological age \u2264 -2, and height velocity SDS for chronological age < 0 within one year prior to Visit 1. Exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, history or presence of active malignancy, and serious co-morbid conditions. As seen in Table 7 , for boys and girls combined, there was a dose-dependent increase in height SDS at Year 1 and Year 2. The increase in height SDS from baseline to Year 2 (0.033 mg/kg/day, 0.8 vs. 0.067 mg/kg/day, 1.4) was significantly greater after treatment with 0.067 mg/kg/day. In addition, the increase in height SDS at Year 1 was significantly greater in both active treatment groups compared to the untreated control group.

Patients were enrolled on the basis of short stature, stimulated GH secretion > 10 ng/mL, and prepubertal status. All patients were observed for height progression for 12 months and were subsequently randomized to this other somatropin product or observation only and followed to final height. Two doses of this other somatropin product were evaluated in this trial: 0.23 mg/kg/week (0.033 mg/kg/day) and 0.47 mg/kg/week (0.067 mg/kg/day). Baseline patient characteristics for the ISS patients who remained prepubertal at randomization (n= 105) were: mean (\u00b1 SD): chronological age 11.4 (1.3) years, height SDS -2.4 (0.4), height velocity SDS -1.1 (0.8), and height velocity 4.4 (0.9) cm/yr, IGF-1 SDS -0.8 (1.4). Patients were treated for a median duration of 5.7 years. Results for final height SDS are displayed by treatment arm in Table 8 . The observed mean gain in final height was 9.8 cm for females and 5.0 cm for males for both doses combined compared to untreated control subjects. A height gain of 1 SDS was observed in 10% of untreated subjects, 50% of subjects receiving 0.23 mg/kg/week and 69% of subjects receiving 0.47 mg/kg/week.

Patients received either this other somatropin product or no treatment for the first year of the studies, while all patients received this other somatropin product during the second year. This other somatropin product was administered as a daily SC injection, and the dose was calculated for each patient every 3 months. In Study 1, the treatment group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week during the entire study. During the second year, the control group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.48 mg/kg/week. In Study 2, the treatment group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.36 mg/kg/week during the entire study. During the second year, the control group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.36 mg/kg/week. The results are presented in Table 9 . Linear growth continued to increase in the second year, when both groups received treatment with this other somatropin product.

Two representative studies, one in adult onset (AO) GHD patients and a second in childhood onset (CO) GHD patients, are described below. Study 1 A single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, six month clinical trial was conducted in 31 adults with AO GHD comparing the effects of NORDITROPIN (somatropin) injection and placebo on body composition. Patients in the active treatment arm were treated with NORDITROPIN 0.017 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 1.33 mg/day). The changes from baseline in lean body mass (LBM) and percent total body fat (TBF) were measured by total body potassium (TBP) after 6 months. Treatment with NORDITROPIN produced a significant increase from baseline in LBM compared to placebo ( Table 10 ). Table 10 \u2013 Lean Body Mass (kg) by TBP NORDITROPIN (n=15) Placebo (n=16) Baseline (mean) 50.27 51.72 Change from baseline at 6 months (mean) 1.12 -0.63 Treatment difference (mean) 95% confidence interval p-value 1.74 (0.65, 2.83) p=0.0028* *Least square mean based on an ANOVA model including treatment and sex as factors Analysis of the treatment difference on the change from baseline in percent TBF revealed a significant decrease in the NORDITROPIN-treated group compared to the placebo group ( Table 11 ). Table 11 \u2013 Total Body Fat (%) by TBP NORDITROPIN (n=15) Placebo (n=16) Baseline (mean) 44.74 42.26 Change from baseline at 6 months (mean) -2.83 1.92 Treatment difference (mean) 95% confidence interval p-value -4.74 (-7.18, -2.30) p=0.0004* *Least square mean based on an ANOVA model including treatment and sex as factors NORDITROPIN also significantly increased serum osteocalcin (a marker of osteoblastic activity). Study 2 A single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding, six month clinical trial was conducted in 49 men with CO GHD comparing the effects of NORDITROPIN and placebo on body composition. Patients were randomized to placebo or one of three active treatment groups (0.008, 0.016, and 0.024 mg/kg/day). Thirty three percent of the total dose to which each patient was randomized was administered during weeks 1-4, 67% during weeks 5-8, and 100% for the remainder of the study. The changes from baseline in LBM and percent TBF were measured by TBP after 6 months. Treatment with NORDITROPIN produced a significant increase from baseline in LBM compared to placebo (pooled data) ( Table 12 ). Table 12 \u2013 Lean Body Mass (kg) by TBP NORDITROPIN (n=36) Placebo (n=13) Baseline (mean) 48.18 48.90 Change from baseline at 6 months (mean) 2.06 0.70 Treatment difference (mean) 95% confidence interval p-value 1.40 (0.39, 2.41) p=0.0079* *Least square mean based on an ANOVA model including treatment as a factor Analysis of the treatment difference on the change from baseline in percent TBF revealed a significant decrease in the NORDITROPIN-treated groups (pooled data) compared to the placebo group ( Table 13 ).

Do not share your Norditropin Pen and needles with another person. You may give another person an infection or get an infection from them. Do not use your Pen without proper training from your healthcare provider . Make sure that you are confident in giving an injection with the Pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the Pen, do not use this Pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the Pen. Step 1. Prepare your Norditropin FlexPro Pen \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Check the name, strength, and colored label on your Pen to make sure that it contains Norditropin in the right strength. \u2022 Pull off the Pen cap. \u2022 Turn the Pen upside down 1 or 2 times to check that the Norditropin in your Pen is clear and colorless. See figure A. If the Norditropin looks cloudy, do not use the Pen. \u2022 When you are ready to give your injection, take a new disposable needle, and remove the paper tab. \u2022 Push the needle straight onto the Pen. Turn the needle clockwise until it is on tight . See figure B. \ua71dAlways use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of Norditropin, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. \u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap and dispose of it . See figure C. \u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. See figure D. \ua71fA drop of Norditropin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the Norditropin flow with each new Pen. See step 2. \ua71dNever use a bent or damaged needle. Step 2. Check the Norditropin flow with each new Pen \ua71f If your Pen is already in use , go to step 3. Before using a new Pen , check the Norditropin flow to make sure the growth hormone can flow through the Pen and needle. 1. Turn the dose selector clockwise 1 tick marking on the dose counter to select 0.025 mg. You will hear a faint \u201cclick\u201d when you turn the dose selector. See figure E. \u2022 1 marking on the dose counter equals 0.025 mg . See figure F. \u2022 Hold the Pen with the needle pointing up. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to \u201c0\u201d. The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer . See figure G. \u2022 Check that a drop of Norditropin appears at the needle tip. See figure H. \ua71dIf no Norditropin appears , repeat step 2 up to 6 times. If you still do not see a drop of Norditropin, change the needle: 1. Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise. Place the needle in a sharps disposal container immediately. See step 5. 2. and repeat step 2 again. Do not use the Pen if a drop of Norditropin still does not appear after changing the needle and repeating step 2. Call Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444 for help. Step 3. Select your dose \u2022 To start, check that the dose pointer is set at \u201c0\u201d. \u2022 \u2022 Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you need. See figure I. When you have selected your dose, you can go to step 4. \ua71f If there is not enough Norditropin left to select a full dose, see Frequently Asked Questions . \ua71fThe dose counter shows the dose in \u201cmg\u201c. See figures J and K. Always use the dose counter to select the exact dose . Do not use the \u201cclick\u201c sounds you hear when you turn the dose selector or the Pen scale to select your dose. Only the dose pointer on the dose counter will show the exact dose selected. \ua71fIf you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct dose. See figure L. The Pen \u201cclicks\u201d sound and feel differently when the dose selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you forcefully move it past the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in the Pen. Step 4. Inject your dose \u2022 Select the injection site. \u2022 Norditropin can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms, as instructed by your healthcare provider. Change the injection site every day. \u2022 Wipe the injection site with an alcohol swab and let the area dry. \u2022 Insert the needle into your skin as your healthcare provider has shown you. See figure M. Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers . This could block the injection. \u2022 Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows \u201c0\u201d. See figure N. The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer . You may then hear or feel a \u201cclick\u201d. \u2022 Continue to hold the needle in your skin. \ua71fIf \u201c0\u201d does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, your needle may be blocked or damaged, see Frequently Asked Questions . \u2022 Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to \u201c0\u201d. Count slowly to 6 to ensure that the full dose has been delivered. See figure O. \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from your skin. See figure P. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. \ua71fYou may see a drop of Norditropin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. Step 5. After your injection \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise. See figure Q. \u2022 Place the needle in a sharps disposal container immediately to reduce the risk of a needle stick. See figure R. \ua71fAlways dispose of the needle after each injection. For further information about safe sharps disposal, see Frequently Asked Questions . \ua71fDo not try to put the needle cap back on . You may stick yourself with the needle. \u2022 Put the Pen cap on your Pen after each use to protect the Norditropin from direct light. See figure S.

The Pen scale shows you approximately how much Norditropin is left in your Pen. See figure T. To see how much Norditropin is left in your Pen, use the dose counter: Turn the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. The dose pointer will line up with the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in the Pen. You can select a maximum dose of 8.0 mg. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with \u201c8.0\u201d, at least 8.0 mg are left in your Pen. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with \u201c3.8\u201d, only 3.8 mg are left in your Pen. See figure U. What if I need a larger dose than what is left in my Pen? It is not possible to select a larger dose on the dose counter than the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in your Pen. If you need more Norditropin than you have left in your Pen, you can use a new Pen or split your dose between your current Pen and a new Pen. Only split your dose if you have been trained or advised by your healthcare provider on how to do this. You may find it helpful to use a calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your healthcare provider. Be very careful to calculate your split dose correctly so that you do not give the wrong dose . If you are not sure how to split your dose using two Pens, then select and inject the dose you need with a new Pen. What if no Norditropin appears when I check the flow? A. Your needle may be blocked or damaged , if no Norditropin appears at the needle tip. Remove the needle as described in step 5 and repeat steps 1 and 2. B.

See \u201cHow should I dispose of my Pen and needles\u201d at the end of these instructions for information on how to throw away (dispose of) used Pens and needles. Pen: This pen represents Norditropin FlexPro 5 mg/1.5 mL, 10 mg/1.5 mL or 15 mg/1.5 mL Pen and Sogroya 5 mg/1.5 mL, 10 mg/1.5 mL, and 15 mg/1.5 mL Pen Needle parts and supplies: Pen case Step 1: Preparing your PenwithPenMate: Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them. Check the name and the colored label on your Pen to make sure it contains the growth hormone strength prescribed by your healthcare provider. Pull off the PenMate cap. See Figure E. Pull off the Pen cap and throw it away. See Figure F. You will not need the Pen cap with your PenMate. Look in the Pen window. Check the liquid medicine in your Pen by turning it upside down 1 or 2 times. See Figure G. \u2022 Norditropin FlexPro Pen : the liquid in the Norditropin FlexPro Pen should be clear and colorless. If the liquid looks cloudy or you see particles, do not use the Norditropin FlexPro Pen . \u2022 Sogroya Pen : the liquid in the Sogroya Pen should be clear to almost clear and colorless to slightly yellow. If the liquid looks cloudy or you see particles, do not use the Sogroya Pen . Wipe the front stopper on the needle thread of the Pen with an alcohol swab. See Figure H. Insert the Pen into the PenMate. Twist the Pen clockwise until you hear or feel a click. See Figure I. The Pen is correctly attached in your PenMate when the display window on the Pen lines up with the insertion button on your PenMate. Step 2. Attaching the needle to your Pen: \u2022 Do not place a needle on your Pen until you are ready to give an injection. \u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. \u2022 Do not use a bent or damaged needle. Get a new disposable needle and tear off the paper tab. See Figure J. Holding the Pen with 1 hand, firmly press the needle onto the needle thread of the Pen. Screw the needle in a clockwise direction until the needle will not turn anymore. See Figure K. Pull off the outer needle cap and save it. See Figure L. You will need the outer needle cap after the injection so you can safely remove the needle from the Pen. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. See Figure M. A drop of liquid may appear at the needle tip. This is normal. Step 3. Priming a new Pen: Checking the growth hormone flow in the Pen (priming) is not needed for a Pen you have used before. If the Pen has already been primed, go to Step 4. Before you use a new Pen you must prepare it for use. Hold the Pen with 1 hand and turn the dose selector clockwise 1 marking to select the minimumdose. See Figure N. You may hear or feel a click when you turn the dose selector. When you turn the dose selector 1 marking, you select the smallest amount of medicine for a dose. See Figure O. This lowest dose will be used for your Norditropin or Sogroya flow check dose. Hold your Pen with PenMate with the needle pointing up. You may see air bubbles in the PenMate window. Gently tap the top of PenMate a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. See Figure P. Press the dose button until the dose pointer lines up with the \u201c0\u201d in the display window on the Pen and a drop of liquid appears at the needle tip. See Figure Q. If no drop of liquid appears at the needle tip, repeat Step 3 again up to 6 times. If there is still no drop of liquid at the needle tip, change the needle and repeat Step 3 again. If a drop of liquid still does not appear at the needle tip after repeating Step 3 and changing the needle, call Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444 for help. Step 4. Selecting the correct dose of Norditropin or Sogroya: Use the dose selector on your Pen to make sure you have the exact dose selected. Your dose will be in a certain number of mg (milligrams). To start, check that the dose pointer on the Pen is set at \u201c0\u201d. Select the dose you need by turning the dose selector clockwise. If you move past your dose, turn the dose selector counterclockwise until the right number of mg lines up with the dose pointer. See Figure R. To guide you, the dose selector click sound is different when turned clockwise (softer click) or counterclockwise (louder click). You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. When dialing counterclockwise, be careful not to press the dose button as liquid will come out. You can use the growth hormone scale on the side of the Pen to see about how much growth hormone is left in the Pen. You can also use the dose selector to see exactly how much growth hormone is left in the Pen. If the Pen contains less than 2 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg (depending on whether you use a 5 mg/1.5 mL, 10 mg/1.5 mL, or 15 mg/1.5 mL Pen), turn the dose selector until it stops. The number that lines up with the dose pointer shows how many mg are left in the Pen. You cannot set a dose higher than the number of mg left in the Pen. If there is not enough Norditropin or Sogroya left in the Pen for your full dose, use a new Norditropin FlexPro Pen or Sogroya Pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose or contact your healthcare provider. Remember to subtract the dose already received. For example, if the dose is 0.7 mg and you can only set the dose selector to 0.35 mg, you should inject another 0.35 mg with a new Norditropin FlexPro Pen or Sogroya Pen. Important: \u2022 Do not use the Pen clicks to count the number of mg you select. Only the display window and dose pointer will show the exact number. \u2022 Do not use the growth hormone scale to measure how much liquid to inject. Only the display window and dose pointer will show the exact number. Step 5. Selecting your injection site and injecting the dose of Norditropin or Sogroya: Change your injection site every day. Select the injection site and wipe your skin with an alcohol swab as your healthcare provider showed you. Norditropin or Sogroya can be injected under your skin (subcutaneously) of your buttocks, stomach area (abdomen), upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or as instructed by your healthcare provider. See Figure S. Hold onto both the PenMate and your Pen without touching the insertion button on the PenMate or the dose button on the Pen. Do not press the insertion button on the PenMate before you are ready to inject your dose. This lowers the risk of hurting yourself with the needle. Hold the PenMate firmly with 1 hand and pull the Pen out with your other hand until you hear and feel a click. See Figure T. The needle is now hidden in PenMate. Norditropin and Sogroya is for use under your skin only (subcutaneous). Hold the PenMate against your skin. Press the insertion button on the PenMate until you hear or feel a click. When you hear or feel the click, the needle has been inserted automatically into your skin. See Figure U. You are now ready to inject your dose. Press the dose button on the Pen to inject your dose.Do not turn the dose button while you are pressing it. If you turn the dose button, you will not inject growth hormone. Make sure you can see the display window. Do not cover it with your fingers. Press and hold down the dose button on the Pen until the display window returns to \u201c0\u201d. The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a firm click. After the display window has returned to \u201c0\u201d, leave the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you get your full dose. See Figure V. Let go of the dose button while you wait. See Figure V . If the dose button cannot be pushed in completely or \u201c0\u201d does not appear in the display window, you did not receive the full dose. Call Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444 for help. You may need a new Pen. Important: Always press the dose button to inject the dose. Turning the dose selector will not inject the dose. Do not touch the display window when you inject, as this can block the injection. Carefully lift the Pen to remove the needle from the skin. See Figure W. Step 6. What to do after your injection is completed: Carefully put the outer needle cap back on the needle. Remove the needle from the Pen after each injection. See Figure X. Unscrew the needle by turning it counterclockwise. Do not touch the needle. Hold the Pen with 1 hand and carefully remove the needle from the Pen with your other hand. See Figure Y. Throw away (dispose of) the needle. See \u201cHow should I dispose of my Pen and needles?\u201d at the end of these instructions. Put the PenMate cap back on your PenMate after each use to protect the growth hormone from direct light. See Figure Z. Important safety information to remember: \u2022 Be careful not to drop your PenMate and Pen or knock them against a hard surface. If this happens you will need to check the growth hormone flow. \u2022 Do not try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle stick injuries. \u2022 After each use always remove and throw away (dispose of) the needle from your Pen. \u2022 Do not share your Pen or needles with other people. \u2022 If your PenMate is damaged or lost, you can still use your Pen without your PenMate. \u2022 Always keep your Pen and needles out of reach of others, especially children. How should I replace an empty Pen? PenMate is reusable and should not be thrown away (disposed of). Reuse your PenMate by replacing your Pen when it is empty. When your Pen is empty, twist the Pen counterclockwise until you hear or feel a click. See Figure AA. Gently pull the Pen out of PenMate. See Figure BB. Before throwing away (disposing of) your empty Pen, make sure the needle has been removed. See \u201cHow should I dispose of my Pen and needles?\u201d at the end of these instructions. Insert the new Pen into your PenMate. See Figure CC. Twist the Pen clockwise until you hear or feel a click. See Figure DD. The Pen is correctly attached in your PenMate when the display window on the Pen lines up with the insertion button on your PenMate. How should I store my PenMate and Pen? \u2022 Do not expose your PenMate or Pen to dust, dirt, liquid, or direct light. \u2022 Store your PenMate and Pen in their case. See Figure D at the beginning of these instructions. \u2022 When your Pen is inserted in PenMate, store it as described in the Patient Information leaflet that comes with your Pen. How should I care for and clean my Pen with PenMate? \u2022 Do not try to refill your Pen. It is prefilled. \u2022 Do not try to repair your PenMate or your Pen. \u2022 Only clean your PenMate or Pen with a mild detergent on a moistened cloth. \u2022 Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your PenMate or Pen. Do not use products containing bleaching agents, such as chlorine, iodine, or alcohol to clean your PenMate or Pen. These products may damage them. \u2022 If there is liquid growth hormone on the outside of your PenMate or Pen, clean it with a mild detergent on a moistened cloth before it dries up. How should I throw away (dispose of) my Pen and needles? \u2022 Put your used needles and Pens in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and Pens in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 upright and stable during use, \u2022 leak-resistant, and \u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and Pens. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Need help? PenMate must only be used according to the instructions provided.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nutropin AQ is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for: Pediatric Patients : Treatment of children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (GHD), idiopathic short stature (ISS), Turner syndrome (TS), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation ( 1.1 ). Adult Patients: Treatment of adults with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GHD ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Pediatric Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) - Nutropin AQ \u00ae is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH). Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of growth failure associated with CKD up to the time of renal transplantation. Nutropin AQ therapy should be used in conjunction with optimal management of CKD. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of ISS, also called non-GHD short stature, defined by height SDS \u2264 \u20132.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range, in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed and for whom diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes associated with short stature that should be observed or treated by other means. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome (TS) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of short stature associated with TS. 1.2 Adult Patients Nutropin AQ is indicated for the replacement of endogenous GH in adults with GHD who meet either of the following two criteria: Adult Onset : Patients who have GHD, either alone or associated with multiple hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism), as a result of pituitary disease, hypothalamic disease, surgery, radiation therapy, or trauma; or Childhood Onset : Patients who were GH deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients who were treated with somatropin for GHD in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for GH deficient adults. According to current standards, confirmation of the diagnosis of adult GHD in both groups involves an appropriate GH provocative test with two exceptions: (1) patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies due to organic disease; and (2) patients with congenital/genetic GHD."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous injection . Therapy with Nutropin AQ should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with short stature associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), chronic kidney disease, Turner syndrome, idiopathic short stature, or adult patients with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GHD. Nutropin AQ should be administered subcutaneously ( 2 ). Injection sites should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy ( 2.3 ). Pediatric GHD: Up to 0.3 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Pubertal Patients: Up to 0.7 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Idiopathic Short Stature: Up to 0.3 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Chronic Kidney Disease: Up to 0.35 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Turner Syndrome: Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Adult GHD: Either a non-weight based or weight-based dosing regimen may be followed, with doses adjusted based on treatment response and IGF-I concentrations ( 2.2 ). Non-weight-based: A starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range 0.15\u20130.3 mg/day) increased gradually every 1\u20132 months by increments of approximately 0.1\u20130.2 mg/day. Weight-based : Initiate from not more than 0.006 mg/kg/day; the dose may be increased up to a maximum of 0.025 mg/kg/day in patients \u2264 35 years old or 0.0125 mg/kg/day in patients > 35 years old. 2.1 Dosing for Pediatric Patients Nutropin AQ dosage and administration schedule should be individualized for each patient. Response to growth hormone (GH) therapy in pediatric patients tends to decrease with time. However, in pediatric patients failure to increase growth rate, particularly during the first year of therapy, suggests the need for close assessment of compliance and evaluation of other causes of growth failure, such as hypothyroidism, under-nutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human GH (rhGH). Treatment with Nutropin AQ for short stature should be discontinued when the epiphyses are fused. Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD ) A weekly dosage of up to 0.3 mg/kg of body weight divided into daily subcutaneous injection is recommended. In pubertal patients, a weekly dosage of up to 0.7 mg/kg divided daily may be used. Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) A weekly dosage of up to 0.35 mg/kg of body weight divided into daily subcutaneous injection is recommended. Nutropin AQ therapy may be continued up to the time of renal transplantation. In order to optimize therapy for patients who require dialysis, the following guidelines for injection schedule are recommended: Hemodialysis patients should receive their injection at night just prior to going to sleep or at least 3 to 4 hours after their hemodialysis to prevent hematoma formation due to the heparin. Chronic Cycling Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD) patients should receive their injection in the morning after they have completed dialysis. Chronic Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) patients should receive their injection in the evening at the time of the overnight exchange. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) A weekly dosage of up to 0.3 mg/kg of body weight divided into daily subcutaneous injections is recommended. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome (TS) A weekly dosage of up to 0.375 mg/kg of body weight divided into equal doses 3 to 7 times per week by subcutaneous injection is recommended. 2.2 Dosing for Adult Patients Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Either of two approaches to Nutropin AQ dosing may be followed: a weight-based regimen or a non-weight-based regimen. Weight based \u2013 Based on the dosing regimen used in the original adult GHD registration trials, the recommended dosage at the start of treatment is not more than 0.006 mg/kg daily. The dose may be increased according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.025 mg/kg daily in patients \u2264 35 years and to a maximum of 0.0125 mg/kg daily in patients over 35 years old. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) concentrations should be used as guidance in dose titration. Non-weight based \u2013 Alternatively, taking into account the published literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15 to 0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1 to 2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-1 concentrations. The dose should be decreased as necessary on the basis of adverse events and/or serum IGF-1 concentrations above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects, when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women. 2.3 Preparation and Administration The solution should be clear immediately after removal from the refrigerator. Occasionally, after refrigeration, you may notice that small colorless particles of protein are present in the solution. This is not unusual for solutions containing proteins. Allow the pen cartridge or NuSpin \u00ae to come to room temperature and gently swirl. If the solution is cloudy, the contents MUST NOT be injected. Parenteral drug products should always be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Injection sites, which may be located on the thigh, upper arm, abdomen or buttock, should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy. Nutropin AQ Pen Cartridge The Nutropin AQ Pen 10 and 20 mg Cartridges are color-banded to help ensure appropriate use with the Nutropin AQ Pen delivery device. Each cartridge must be used with its corresponding color-coded Nutropin AQ Pen [See Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . Wipe the septum of the Nutropin AQ Pen Cartridge with rubbing alcohol or an antiseptic solution to prevent contamination of the contents by microorganisms that may be introduced by repeated needle insertions. It is recommended that Nutropin AQ be administered using sterile, disposable needles. Follow the directions provided in the Nutropin AQ Pen Instructions for Use. The Nutropin AQ Pen 10 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.1 mg to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg, in 0.1 mg increments. The Nutropin AQ Pen 20 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.2 mg to a maximum dose of 8.0 mg, in 0.2 mg increments. Nutropin AQ NuSpin The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 5, 10 and 20 are multi-dose, dial-a-dose injection devices prefilled with Nutropin AQ in a 5 mg/2 mL, 10 mg/2 mL or 20 mg/2 mL cartridge, respectively, for subcutaneous use. It is recommended that Nutropin AQ be administered using sterile, disposable needles. Follow the directions provided in the Nutropin AQ NuSpin 5, 10 or 20 Instructions for Use. The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 5 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.05 mg to a maximum dose of 1.75 mg, in increments of 0.05 mg. The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 10 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.1 mg to a maximum dose of 3.5 mg, in increments of 0.1 mg. The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 20 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.2 mg to a maximum dose of 7.0 mg, in increments of 0.2 mg."

Active malignancy ( 4 ). Hypersensitivity to somatropin or excipients ( 4 ). Active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( 4 ). Children with closed epiphysis ( 4 ). Acute Critical Illness Treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin is contraindicated in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) in Children Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with PWS who are severely obese, have a history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or have severe respiratory impairment. There have been reports of sudden death when somatropin was used in such patients. Nutropin AQ is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed PWS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Active Malignancy In general, somatropin is contraindicated in the presence of active malignancy. Any pre-existing malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with somatropin. Somatropin should be discontinued if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Since growth hormone deficiency (GHD) may be an early sign of the presence of a pituitary tumor (or, rarely, other brain tumors), the presence of such tumors should be ruled out prior to initiation of treatment. Somatropin should not be used in patients with any evidence of progression or recurrence of an underlying intracranial tumor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Nutropin AQ is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of its excipients. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Diabetic Retinopathy Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Closed Epiphysis Somatropin should not be used for growth promotion in pediatric patients with closed epiphysis."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute critical illness: Evaluate potential benefit of treatment continuation against potential risk ( 5.1 ). PWS: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiating therapy. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur. ( 5.2 ). Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or reoccurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm. ( 5.3 ). Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients, as IGT and DM may be unmasked during somatropin therapy. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in patients with DM may require adjustment. ( 5.4 ). Intracranial hypertension (IH): Exclude preexisting papilledema. IH may develop, but is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction ( 5.5 ). Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention ( 5.6 ). Fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome- especially in adults): Reduce dose as necessary if such signs develop ( 5.7 ). Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increase in those with known hypoadrenalism ( 5.8 ). Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as it may first become evident or worsen after initiation of somatropin ( 5.9 ). Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE): Evaluate any child with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain for possible SCFE and osteonecrosis ( 5.10 ). Progression of preexisting scoliosis: Monitor any child with scoliosis for progression of the curve ( 5.11 ). Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain ( 5.16 ). 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illnesses due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4) ] . Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-GHD adult patients (n = 522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3\u20138 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with PWS syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with PWS treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4) ] . Nutropin AQ is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed PWS. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4) ] . Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment, and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity, Turner syndrome (TS), or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e. insulin or oral/injectable agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial Hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with TS, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and PWS may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs. 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment [see Section 7.1, 11-\u03b2 Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 ]. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with TS have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) in Pediatric Patients SCFE may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and TS) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. SCFE may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of SCFE with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin, including NUTROPIN AQ. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during NUTROPIN AQ therapy should be evaluated for SCFE and osteonecrosis and managed accordingly. 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated TS patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with PWS. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.12 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Patients with Turner Syndrome Patients with TS should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders, as these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with TS. In addition, patients with TS should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypertension, aortic aneurysm or dissection, stroke) as these patients are also at increased risk for these conditions. 5.13 Osteodystrophy in Pediatric Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Children with growth failure secondary to CKD should be examined periodically for evidence of progression of renal osteodystrophy. SCFE or avascular necrosis of the femoral head may be seen in children with advanced renal osteodystrophy, and it is uncertain whether these problems are affected by somatropin therapy. X-rays of the hip should be obtained prior to initiating somatropin therapy in CKD patients and physicians and parents should be alert to the development of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain in these patients treated with Nutropin AQ. No studies have been completed evaluating Nutropin AQ therapy in patients who have received renal transplants. Currently, treatment of patients with functioning renal allografts is not indicated. 5.14 Lipoatrophy When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.15 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and IGF-1 may increase during somatropin therapy. 5.16 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have TS may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin\u2013treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain."

Additional common adverse reactions in adults include edema, arthralgias, and carpal tunnel syndrome ( 6.1 , 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Pediatric Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Injection site discomfort has been reported. This is more commonly observed in children switched from another somatropin product to Nutropin AQ. Turner Syndrome In a randomized, controlled trial, there was a statistically significant increase, as compared to untreated controls, in otitis media (43% vs. 26%) and ear disorders (18% vs. 5%) in patients receiving somatropin. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) In a post-marketing surveillance study, the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS), the pattern of adverse events in over 8,000 patients with ISS was consistent with the known safety profile of growth hormone (GH), and no new safety signals attributable to GH were identified. The frequency of protocol-defined targeted adverse events is described in the table , below. Table 1 Protocol-Defined Targeted Adverse Events in the ISS NCGS Cohort Reported Events NCGS (N = 8018) AVN = avascular necrosis; SCFE = slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Data obtained with several rhGH products (Nutropin, Nutropin AQ, Nutropin Depot and Protropin). Any Adverse Even t Overall 103 (1.3%) Targeted Adverse Event Overall 103 (1.3%) Injection-site reaction 28 (0.3%) New onset or progression of scoliosis 16 (0.2%) Gynecomastia 12 (0.1%) Any new onset or recurring tumor (benign) 12 (0.1%) Arthralgia or arthritis 10 (0.1%) Diabetes mellitus 5 (0.1%) Edema 5 (0.1%) Cancer, neoplasm (new onset or recurrence) 4 (0.0%) Fracture 4 (0.0%) Intracranial hypertension 4 (0.0%) Abnormal bone or other growth 3 (0.0%) Central nervous system tumor 2 (0.0%) New or recurrent SCFE or AVN 2 (0.0%) Carpal tunnel syndrome 1 (0.0%) In subjects treated in a long-term study of Nutropin for ISS, mean fasting and postprandial insulin levels increased, while mean fasting and postprandial glucose levels remained unchanged. Mean hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) levels rose slightly from baseline as expected during adolescence; sporadic values outside normal limits occurred transiently. Adult Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency In clinical studies with Nutropin AQ in GHD adults, edema or peripheral edema was reported in 41% of GH-treated patients and 25% of placebo-treated patients. In GHD adults, arthralgias and other joint disorders were reported in 27% of GH-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients. Nutropin therapy in adults with GHD of adult-onset was associated with an increase of median fasting insulin level in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 9.0 \u00b5U/mL at baseline to 13.0 \u00b5U/mL at Month 12 with a return to the baseline median level after a 3-week post-washout period of GH therapy. In the placebo group there was no change from 8.0 \u00b5U/mL at baseline to Month 12, and after the post-washout period, the median level was 9.0 \u00b5U/mL. The between-treatment group difference on the change from baseline to Month 12 in median fasting insulin level was significant, p < 0.0001. In childhood-onset subjects, there was an increase of median fasting insulin level in the Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day group from 11.0 \u00b5U/mL at baseline to 20.0 \u00b5U/mL at Month 12, in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 8.5 \u00b5U/mL to 11.0 \u00b5U/mL, and in the placebo group from 7.0 \u00b5U/mL to 8.0 \u00b5U/mL. The between-treatment group differences for these changes were significant, p = 0.0007. In subjects with adult-onset GHD, there were no between-treatment group differences on change from baseline to Month 12 in mean A1C level, p = 0.08. In childhood-onset GHD, the mean A1C level increased in the Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day group from 5.2% at baseline to 5.5% at Month 12, and did not change in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 5.1% at baseline or in the placebo group from 5.3% at baseline. The between-treatment group differences were significant, p = 0.009. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nutropin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of GH, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/L have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/L, interference with the growth response was observed. In clinical studies of pediatric patients that were treated with Nutropin for the first time, 0/107 GHD patients, 0/125 CKD patients, 0/112 TS, and 0/117 ISS patients screened for antibody production developed antibodies with binding capacities \u2265 2 mg/L at six months. In a clinical study of patients that were treated with Nutropin AQ for the first time, 0/38 GHD patients screened for antibody production for up to 15 months developed antibodies with binding capacities \u2265 2 mg/L. Additional short-term immunologic and renal function studies were carried out in a group of pediatric patients with CKD after approximately one year of treatment to detect other potential adverse effects of antibodies to GH. Testing included measurements of C1q, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor, creatinine, creatinine clearance, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). No adverse effects of GH antibodies were noted . 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of somatropin or NUTROPIN AQ. Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, CKD, or TS, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in GH-treated patients: gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis [Children and adults, see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ]. The following adverse reactions have been observed during the use of somatropin, including NUTROPIN AQ: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis [children, see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] and osteonecrosis (children)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11 \u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses ( 7.1 , 7.2 ). Glucocorticoid replacement: Should be carefully adjusted ( 7.2 ). Cytochrome P450- Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin ( 7.3 ). Oral estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women ( 7.4 ). Insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents: May require adjustment ( 7.5 ). 7.1 11 \u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2HSD-1 is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Growth hormone (GH) and somatropin inhibit 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth-promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be carefully adjusted in children with concomitant GH and glucocorticoid deficiency to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. The use of Nutropin AQ in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requiring glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy may inhibit the growth promoting effect of Nutropin AQ. Therefore, if glucocorticoid replacement is required for CKD, the glucocorticoid dose should be carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. In the clinical trials there was no evidence of drug interactions with Nutropin and commonly used drugs used in the management of CKD. 7.3 Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases CYP450-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral/injectable hypoglycemic agents may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

It is not known whether Nutropin AQ is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Nutropin AQ is administered to a nursing mother. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Nutropin AQ did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Nutropin AQ (somatropin) injection, for subcutaneous use is a human growth hormone (hGH) produced by recombinant DNA technology. Nutropin AQ has 191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of pituitary-derived hGH. Nutropin AQ may contain not more than fifteen percent deamidated GH at expiration. The deamidated form of GH has been extensively characterized and has been shown to be safe and fully active. Nutropin AQ is a sterile liquid intended for subcutaneous administration. The product is nearly isotonic at a concentration of 5 mg of GH per mL and has a pH of approximately 6.0. Each pen cartridge or NuSpin contain either 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of somatropin formulated in 17.4 mg sodium chloride, 5 mg phenol, 4 mg polysorbate 20, and 10 mM sodium citrate [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin (as well as endogenous growth hormone) binds to dimeric growth hormone receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical testing have demonstrated that Nutropin AQ is therapeutically equivalent to pituitary-derived hGH. Pediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with Turner syndrome (TS) that were treated with Nutropin AQ or Nutropin resulted in an increase in growth rate and an increase in IGF-1 levels similar to that seen with pituitary-derived hGH. Tissue Growth A) Skeletal Growth : Nutropin AQ stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth failure due to a lack of adequate secretion of endogenous GH or secondary to CKD and in patients with TS. Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and one of its mediators, IGF-I. Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are GHD, but increase during treatment with somatropin. In pediatric patients, new bone is formed at the epiphyses in response to GH and IGF-I. This results in linear growth until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty. B) Cell Growth : Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and the size of skeletal muscle cells. C) Organ Growth : GH influences the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red cell mass. Treatment of hypophysectomized or genetic dwarf rats with somatropin results in organ growth that is proportional to the overall body growth. In normal rats subjected to nephrectomy-induced uremia, somatropin promoted skeletal and body growth. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by GH-stimulated protein synthesis. This is reflected by nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during somatropin therapy. Carbohydrate Metabolism GH is a modulator of carbohydrate metabolism. For example, patients with inadequate secretion of GH sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with Nutropin AQ. Somatropin therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity. Untreated patients with CKD and TS have an increased incidence of glucose intolerance. Administration of somatropin to adults or children resulted in increases in serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels, more commonly in overweight or obese individuals. In addition, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels remained in the normal range. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, increased plasma fatty acids, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels. Mineral Metabolism The retention of total body potassium in response to somatropin administration apparently results from cellular growth. Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, CKD, or TS during Nutropin AQ therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney. Serum calcium is not significantly altered in these patients. Sodium retention also occurs. Adults with childhood-onset GHD show low bone mineral density (BMD). Nutropin AQ therapy results in increases in serum alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Connective Tissue Metabolism GH stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and collagen as well as the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of somatropin after subcutaneous administration in healthy adult males has been determined to be 81 \u00b1 20%. The mean terminal t 1/2 after subcutaneous administration is significantly longer than that seen after intravenous administration (2.1 \u00b1 0.43 hours vs. 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes) indicating that the subcutaneous absorption of the compound is slow and rate-limiting. Distribution Animal studies with somatropin showed that GH localizes to highly perfused organs, particularly the liver and kidney. The volume of distribution at steady state for somatropin in healthy adult males is about 50 mL/kg body weight, approximating the serum volume. Metabolism Both the liver and kidney have been shown to be important metabolizing organs for GH. Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance. GH is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. It is then cleaved within renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation. Elimination The mean terminal t 1/2 after intravenous administration of somatropin in healthy adult males is estimated to be 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes. Clearance of rhGH after intravenous administration in healthy adults and children is reported to be in the range of 116\u2013174 mL/hr/kg. Bioequivalence of Formulations Nutropin AQ has been determined to be bioequivalent to Nutropin based on the statistical evaluation of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ). Special Populations Pediatric: Available literature data suggests that somatropin clearances are similar in adults and children. Geriatrics : Limited published data suggest that the plasma clearance and average steady-state plasma concentration of somatropin may not be different between young and elderly patients. Race: Reported values for half-lives for endogenous GH in normal adult black males are not different from observed values for normal adult white males. No data for other races are available. Growth Hormone Deficiency: Reported values for clearance of somatropin in adults and children with GHD range 138\u2013245 mL/hr/kg and are similar to those observed in healthy adults and children. Mean terminal t 1/2 values following intravenous and subcutaneous administration in adult and pediatric GHD patients are also similar to those observed in healthy adult males. Chronic Kidney Disease : Children and adults with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) tend to have decreased clearance compared to normals. In a study with six pediatric patients 7 to 11 years of age, the clearance of Nutropin was reduced by 21.5% and 22.6% after the intravenous infusion and subcutaneous injection, respectively, of 0.05 mg/kg of Nutropin compared to normal healthy adults. Endogenous GH production may also increase in some individuals with ESRD. However, no somatropin accumulation has been reported in children with CKD or ESRD dosed with current regimens. Turner Syndrome : No pharmacokinetic data are available for exogenously administered somatropin. However, reported half-lives, absorption, and elimination rates for endogenous GH in this population are similar to the ranges observed for normal subjects and GHD populations. Hepatic Insufficiency: A reduction in somatropin clearance has been noted in patients with severe liver dysfunction. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown. Gender: No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been done with Nutropin AQ. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin (as well as endogenous growth hormone) binds to dimeric growth hormone receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical testing have demonstrated that Nutropin AQ is therapeutically equivalent to pituitary-derived hGH. Pediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with Turner syndrome (TS) that were treated with Nutropin AQ or Nutropin resulted in an increase in growth rate and an increase in IGF-1 levels similar to that seen with pituitary-derived hGH. Tissue Growth A) Skeletal Growth : Nutropin AQ stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth failure due to a lack of adequate secretion of endogenous GH or secondary to CKD and in patients with TS. Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and one of its mediators, IGF-I. Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are GHD, but increase during treatment with somatropin. In pediatric patients, new bone is formed at the epiphyses in response to GH and IGF-I. This results in linear growth until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty. B) Cell Growth : Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and the size of skeletal muscle cells. C) Organ Growth : GH influences the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red cell mass. Treatment of hypophysectomized or genetic dwarf rats with somatropin results in organ growth that is proportional to the overall body growth. In normal rats subjected to nephrectomy-induced uremia, somatropin promoted skeletal and body growth. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by GH-stimulated protein synthesis. This is reflected by nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during somatropin therapy. Carbohydrate Metabolism GH is a modulator of carbohydrate metabolism. For example, patients with inadequate secretion of GH sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with Nutropin AQ. Somatropin therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity. Untreated patients with CKD and TS have an increased incidence of glucose intolerance. Administration of somatropin to adults or children resulted in increases in serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels, more commonly in overweight or obese individuals. In addition, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels remained in the normal range. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, increased plasma fatty acids, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels. Mineral Metabolism The retention of total body potassium in response to somatropin administration apparently results from cellular growth. Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, CKD, or TS during Nutropin AQ therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney. Serum calcium is not significantly altered in these patients. Sodium retention also occurs. Adults with childhood-onset GHD show low bone mineral density (BMD). Nutropin AQ therapy results in increases in serum alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Connective Tissue Metabolism GH stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and collagen as well as the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of somatropin after subcutaneous administration in healthy adult males has been determined to be 81 \u00b1 20%. The mean terminal t 1/2 after subcutaneous administration is significantly longer than that seen after intravenous administration (2.1 \u00b1 0.43 hours vs. 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes) indicating that the subcutaneous absorption of the compound is slow and rate-limiting. Distribution Animal studies with somatropin showed that GH localizes to highly perfused organs, particularly the liver and kidney. The volume of distribution at steady state for somatropin in healthy adult males is about 50 mL/kg body weight, approximating the serum volume. Metabolism Both the liver and kidney have been shown to be important metabolizing organs for GH. Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance. GH is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. It is then cleaved within renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation. Elimination The mean terminal t 1/2 after intravenous administration of somatropin in healthy adult males is estimated to be 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes. Clearance of rhGH after intravenous administration in healthy adults and children is reported to be in the range of 116\u2013174 mL/hr/kg. Bioequivalence of Formulations Nutropin AQ has been determined to be bioequivalent to Nutropin based on the statistical evaluation of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ). Special Populations Pediatric: Available literature data suggests that somatropin clearances are similar in adults and children. Geriatrics : Limited published data suggest that the plasma clearance and average steady-state plasma concentration of somatropin may not be different between young and elderly patients. Race: Reported values for half-lives for endogenous GH in normal adult black males are not different from observed values for normal adult white males. No data for other races are available. Growth Hormone Deficiency: Reported values for clearance of somatropin in adults and children with GHD range 138\u2013245 mL/hr/kg and are similar to those observed in healthy adults and children. Mean terminal t 1/2 values following intravenous and subcutaneous administration in adult and pediatric GHD patients are also similar to those observed in healthy adult males. Chronic Kidney Disease : Children and adults with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) tend to have decreased clearance compared to normals. In a study with six pediatric patients 7 to 11 years of age, the clearance of Nutropin was reduced by 21.5% and 22.6% after the intravenous infusion and subcutaneous injection, respectively, of 0.05 mg/kg of Nutropin compared to normal healthy adults.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Pubertal Patients with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) One open label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of two dosages of Nutropin was performed in pubertal patients with GHD. Ninety-seven patients (mean age 13.9 years, 83 male, 14 female) currently being treated with approximately 0.3 mg/kg/wk of GH were randomized to 0.3 mg/kg/wk or 0.7 mg/kg/wk Nutropin doses. All patients were already in puberty (Tanner stage \u2265 2) and had bone ages \u2264 14 years in males or \u2264 12 years in females. Mean baseline height standard deviation score (SDS) was \u20131.3. The mean last measured height in all 97 patients after a mean duration of 2.7 \u00b1 1.2 years, by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline height, is shown below. Table 3 Last Measured Height Adjusted for baseline height by Sex and Nutropin Dose for Pubertal Patients with GHD Last Measured Height (cm) Height Difference Between Groups (cm) Age (yr) 0.3 mg/kg/wk 0.7 mg/kg/wk Mean \u00b1 SD (range) Mean \u00b1 SD Mean \u00b1 SD Mean \u00b1 SE Male 17.2 \u00b1 1.3 (13.6 to 19.4) 170.9 \u00b1 7.9 (n = 42) 174.5 \u00b1 7.9 (n = 41) 3.6 \u00b1 1.7 Female 15.8 \u00b1 1.8 (11.9 to 19.3) 154.7 \u00b1 6.3 (n = 7) 157.6 \u00b1 6.3 (n = 7) 2.9 \u00b1 3.4 The mean height SDS at last measured height (n = 97) was \u20130.7 \u00b1 1.0 in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group and \u2013 0.1 \u00b1 1.2 in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group. For patients completing 3.5 or more years (mean 4.1 years) of Nutropin treatment (15/49 patients in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group and 16/48 patients in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group), the mean last measured height was 166.1 \u00b1 8.0 cm in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group and 171.8 \u00b1 7.1 cm in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group, adjusting for baseline height and sex. The mean change in bone age was approximately one year for each year in the study in both dose groups. Patients with baseline height SDS above \u20131.0 were able to attain normal adult heights with the 0.3 mg/kg/wk dose of Nutropin (mean height SDS at near-adult height = \u20130.1, n = 15). Thirty-one patients had bone mineral density (BMD) determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans at study conclusion. The two dose groups did not differ significantly in mean SDS for total body BMD (\u20130.9 \u00b1 1.9 in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group vs. \u20130.8 \u00b1 1.2 in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group, n = 20) or lumbar spine BMD (\u20131.0 \u00b1 1.0 in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group vs. \u20130.2 \u00b1 1.7 in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group, n = 21). Over a mean duration of 2.7 years, patients in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group were more likely to have IGF-I values above the normal range than patients in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group (27.7% vs. 9.0% of IGF-I measurements for individual patients). The clinical significance of elevated IGF-I values is unknown. 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Two multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted to determine whether treatment with Nutropin prior to renal transplantation in patients with CKD could improve their growth rates and height deficits. One study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and the other was an open-label, randomized trial. The dose of Nutropin in both controlled studies was 0.05 mg/kg/day (0.35 mg/kg/week) administered daily by subcutaneous injection. Combining the data from those patients completing two years in the two controlled studies results in 62 patients treated with Nutropin and 28 patients in the control groups (either placebo-treated or untreated). The mean first year growth rate was 10.8 cm/yr for Nutropin-treated patients, compared with a mean growth rate of 6.5 cm/yr for placebo/untreated controls (p < 0.00005). The mean second year growth rate was 7.8 cm/yr for the Nutropin-treated group, compared with 5.5 cm/yr for controls (p < 0.00005). There was a significant increase in mean height SDS in the Nutropin group (\u20132.9 at baseline to \u20131.5 at Month 24, n = 62) but no significant change in the controls (-2.8 at baseline to \u20132.9 at Month 24, n = 28). The mean third year growth rate of 7.6 cm/yr in the Nutropin-treated patients (n = 27) suggests that Nutropin stimulates growth beyond two years. However, there are no control data for the third year because control patients crossed over to Nutropin treatment after two years of participation. The gains in height were accompanied by appropriate advancement of skeletal age. These data demonstrate that Nutropin therapy improves growth rate and corrects the acquired height deficit associated with CKD. The North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS) has reported data for growth post-transplant in children who did not receive GH prior to transplantation as well as children who did receive Nutropin during the clinical trials prior to transplantation. The average change in height SDS during the initial two years post-transplant was 0.15 for the 2,391 patients who did not receive GH pre-transplant and 0.28 for the 57 patients who did 1 . For patients who were followed for 5 years post-transplant , the corresponding changes in height SDS were also similar between groups . 14.3 Pediatric Patients with Turner Syndrome (TS) Three US studies, two long-term, open-label, multicenter, historically controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2), and one long-term, randomized, dose-response study (Study 3) and one Canadian, long-term, randomized, open-label, multicenter, concurrently controlled study, were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of somatropin treatment of short stature due to TS. In the US Studies 1 and 2, the effect of long-term GH treatment (0.375 mg/kg/week given either 3 times per week or daily) on adult height was determined by comparing adult heights in the treated patients with those of age-matched historical controls with TS who received no growth-promoting therapy. In Study 1, estrogen treatment was delayed until patients were at least age 14. GH therapy resulted in a mean adult height gain of 7.4 cm (mean duration of GH therapy of 7.6 years) vs. matched historical controls by ANCOVA. In Study 2, patients treated with early Nutropin therapy (before 11 years of age) were randomized to receive estrogen-replacement therapy (conjugated estrogens, 0.3 mg escalating to 0.625 mg daily) at either age 12 or 15 years. Compared with matched historical controls, early Nutropin therapy (mean duration of 5.6 years) combined with estrogen replacement at age 12 years resulted in an adult height gain of 5.9 cm (n = 26), whereas girls who initiated estrogen at age 15 years (mean duration of Nutropin therapy 6.1 years) had a mean adult height gain of 8.3 cm (n = 29). Patients who initiated Nutropin after age 11 (mean age 12.7 years; mean duration of Nutropin therapy 3.8 years) had a mean adult height gain of 5.0 cm (n = 51). Thus, in Studies 1 and 2, the greatest improvement in adult height was observed in patients who received early GH treatment and estrogen after age 14 years. In Study 3, a randomized, blinded dose-response study, patients were treated from a mean age of 11.1 years for a mean duration of 5.3 years with a weekly GH dose of either 0.27 mg/kg or 0.36 mg/kg administered in divided doses 3 or 6 times weekly. The mean near-final height of GH-treated patients was 148.7 \u00b1 6.5 cm (n = 31). When compared to historical control data, the mean gain in adult height was approximately 5 cm. The Canadian randomized study compared near-adult height outcomes for GH-treated patients to those of a concurrent control group who received no injections. The somatropin-treated patients received a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/week given in divided doses 6 times per week from a mean age of 11.7 years for a mean duration of 4.7 years. Puberty was induced with a standardized estrogen regimen initiated at 13 years of age for both treatment groups. The somatropin-treated group (n = 27) attained a mean (\u00b1 SD) near final height of 146.0 \u00b1 6.2 cm; the untreated control group (n = 19) attained a near final height of 142.1 \u00b1 4.8 cm. By ANCOVA (with adjustments for baseline height and mid-parental height), the effect of GH-treatment was a mean height increase of 5.4 cm (p = 0.001). In summary, patients with TS (total n = 181 from the 4 studies above) treated to adult height achieved statistically significant average height gains ranging from 5.0\u20138.3 cm.

Canadian RCT 27 11.7 13 4.7 5.4 14.4 Pediatric Patient with Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) A long-term, open-label, multicenter study was conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of Nutropin in pediatric patients with ISS, also called non-growth hormone deficient short stature. For the first year, 122 pre-pubertal subjects over the age of 5 years with stimulated serum GH \u2265 10 ng/mL were randomized into two treatment groups of approximately equal size; one group was treated with Nutropin 0.3 mg/kg weekly divided into three doses per week and the other group served as untreated controls. For the second and subsequent years of the study, all subjects were re-randomized to receive the same total weekly dose of Nutropin (0.3 mg/kg weekly) administered either daily or three times weekly. Treatment with Nutropin was continued until a subject's bone age was > 15.0 years (boys) or > 14.0 years (girls) and the growth rate was < 2 cm/yr, after which subjects were followed until adult height was achieved. The mean baseline values were: height SDS\u20132.8, IGF-I SDS -0.9, age 9.4 years, bone age 7.8 years, growth rate 4.4 cm/yr, mid-parental target height SDS \u20130.7, and Bayley-Pinneau predicted adult height SDS \u20132.3. Nearly all subjects had predicted adult height that was less than mid-parental target height. During the one-year controlled phase of the study, the mean height velocity increased by 0.5 \u00b1 1.8 cm (mean \u00b1 SD) in the no-treatment control group and by 3.1 \u00b1 1.7 cm in the Nutropin group (p < 0.0001). For the same period of treatment the mean height SDS increased by 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 and remained unchanged (0.0 \u00b1 0.2) in the control group (p < 0.001). Of the 118 subjects who were treated with Nutropin (70%) reached near-adult height (hereafter called adult height) after 2\u201310 years of Nutropin therapy. Their last measured height, including post-treatment follow-up, was obtained at a mean age of 18.3 years in males and 17.3 years in females. The mean duration of therapy was 6.2 and 5.5 years, respectively. Adult height was greater than pretreatment predicted adult height in 49 of 60 males (82%) and 19 of 23 females (83%). The mean difference between adult height and pretreatment predicted adult height was 5.2 cm (2.0 inches) in males and 6.0 cm (2.4 inches) in females (p < 0.0001 for both). The table (below) summarizes the efficacy data.

During continued treatment, mean IGF-I levels remained close to the normal mean. IGF-I SDS above + 2 occurred sporadically in 14 subjects. 14.5 Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in growth hormone-deficient adults. Study 1 was conducted in subjects with adult-onset GHD (n = 166), mean age 48.3 years, at doses of 0.0125 or 0.00625 mg/kg/day; doses of 0.025 mg/kg/day were not tolerated in these subjects. Study 2 was conducted in previously treated subjects with childhood-onset GHD (n = 64), mean age 23.8 years, at randomly assigned doses of 0.025 or 0.0125 mg/kg/day. The studies were designed to assess the effects of replacement therapy with Nutropin on body composition. Significant changes from baseline to Month 12 of treatment in body composition (i.e., total body % fat mass, trunk % fat mass, and total body % lean mass by DEXA scan) were seen in all Nutropin groups in both studies (p < 0.0001 for change from baseline and vs. placebo), whereas no statistically significant changes were seen in either of the placebo groups. In the adult-onset study, the Nutropin group improved mean total body fat from 35.0% to 31.5%, mean trunk fat from 33.9% to 29.5%, and mean lean body mass from 62.2% to 65.7%, whereas the placebo group had mean changes of 0.2% or less (p = not significant). Due to the possible effect of GH-induced fluid retention on DEXA measurements of lean body mass, DEXA scans were repeated approximately 3 weeks after completion of therapy; mean % lean body mass in the Nutropin group was 65.0%, a change of 2.8% from baseline, compared with a change of 0.4% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 between groups). In the childhood-onset study, the high-dose Nutropin group improved mean total body fat from 38.4% to 32.1%, mean trunk fat from 36.7% to 29.0%, and mean lean body mass from 59.1% to 65.5%; the low-dose Nutropin group improved mean total body fat from 37.1% to 31.3%, mean trunk fat from 37.9% to 30.6%, and mean lean body mass from 60.0% to 66.0%; the placebo group had mean changes of 0.6% or less (p = not significant).

In the childhood-onset study significant decreases from baseline to Month 12 in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and LDL:HDL ratio were seen in the high-dose Nutropin group only, compared to the placebo group, p < 0.05. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides from baseline to Month 12. In the childhood-onset study, 55% of the patients had decreased spine BMD (z-score < \u20131) at baseline. The administration of Nutropin (n = 16) (0.025 mg/kg/day) for two years resulted in increased spine BMD from baseline when compared to placebo (n = 13) (4.6% vs. 1.0%, respectively, p < 0.03); a transient decrease in spine BMD was seen at six months in the Nutropin-treated patients. Thirty-five percent of subjects treated with this dose had supraphysiological levels of IGF-I at some point during the study, which may carry unknown risks. No significant improvement in total body BMD was found when compared to placebo. A lower GH dose (0.0125 mg/kg/day) did not show significant increments in either of these bone parameters when compared to placebo. No statistically significant effects on BMD were seen in the adult-onset study where patients received GH (0.0125 mg/kg/day) for one year. Muscle strength, physical endurance, and quality of life measurements were not markedly abnormal at baseline, and no statistically significant effects of Nutropin therapy were observed in the two studies. A subsequent 32-week, multicenter, open-label, controlled clinical trial was conducted using Nutropin AQ, Nutropin Depot, or no treatment in adults with both adult-onset and childhood-onset GHD. Subjects were randomized into the three groups to evaluate effects on body composition, including change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as determined by computed tomography (CT) scan. For subjects evaluable for change in VAT in the Nutropin AQ (n = 44) and untreated (n = 19) groups, the mean age was 46.2 years and 78% had adult-onset GHD. Subjects in the Nutropin AQ group were treated at doses up to 0.012 mg/kg per day in women (all of whom received estrogen replacement therapy) and men under age 35 years, and up to 0.006 mg/kg per day in men over age 35 years. The mean absolute change in VAT from baseline to Week 32 was \u201310.7 cm 2 in the Nutropin AQ group and + 8.4 cm 2 in the untreated group (p = 0.013 between groups). There was a 6.7% VAT loss in the Nutropin AQ group (mean percent change from baseline to Week 32) compared with a 7.5% increase in the untreated group (p = 0.012 between groups). The effect of reducing VAT in adult GHD patients with Nutropin AQ on long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

OMNITROPE is indicated for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational age (SGA) who fail to manifest catch-up growth by age 2 years. OMNITROPE is indicated for the treatment of growth failure associated with Turner Syndrome. OMNITROPE is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic short stature (ISS), also called non-growth hormone-deficient short stature, defined by height standard deviation score (SDS) \u2264 -2.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range, in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed and for whom diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes associated with short stature that should be observed or treated by other means. 1.2 Adult Patients OMNITROPE is indicated for the replacement of endogenous GH in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) who meet either of the following two criteria: \u2022 Adult Onset (AO): Patients who have GHD, either alone or associated with multiple hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism), as a result of pituitary disease, hypothalamic disease, surgery, radiation therapy, or trauma; or \u2022 Childhood Onset (CO): Patients who were GH deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients who were treated with somatropin for growth hormone deficiency in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for growth hormone deficient adults. Confirmation of the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency in both groups involves an appropriate growth hormone provocative test with two exceptions: (1) patients with multiple other pituitary hormone deficiencies due to organic disease; and (2) patients with congenital/genetic growth hormone deficiency."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections. Therapy with OMNITROPE should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with short stature associated with GHD, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), Turner Syndrome (TS), those who were born small for gestational age (SGA), Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) and adult patients with either childhood onset or adult onset GHD. OMNITROPE should be administered subcutaneously ( 2 ). \u2022 Pediatric GHD: 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg/week, divided into 6 to 7 daily injections ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Prader-Willi Syndrome: 0.24 mg/kg/week, divided into 6 to 7 daily injections ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Small for Gestational Age: Up to 0.48 mg/kg/week, divided into 6 to 7 daily injections ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Turner Syndrome: 0.33 mg/kg/week, divided into 6 to 7 daily injections ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Idiopathic Short Stature: Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week, divided into 6 to 7 daily injections ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult GHD: not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week (divided into daily injections) to be increased as tolerated to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week; to be increased gradually every 1 to 2 months ( 2.2 ) \u2022 OMNITROPE Cartridges 5 mg/1.5 mL and 10 mg/1.5 mL must be used with the corresponding OMNITROPE Pen 5 and Pen 10 delivery system, respectively ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Injection sites should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Dosing of Pediatric Patients General Pediatric Dosing Information The OMNITROPE dosage and administration schedule should be individualized based on the growth response of each patient. Response to somatropin therapy in pediatric patients tends to decrease with time. However, in pediatric patients, the failure to increase growth rate, particularly during the first year of therapy, indicates the need for close assessment of compliance and evaluation for other causes of growth failure, such as hypothyroidism, undernutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human GH (rhGH). Treatment with OMNITROPE for short stature should be discontinued when the epiphyses are fused. Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Generally, a dosage of 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) Generally, a dosage of 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections. Small for Gestational Age (SGA) Generally, a dosage of up to 0.48 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections. Turner Syndrome (TS) Generally, a dose of 0.33 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) Generally, a dose up to 0.47 mg/kg of body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections. 2.2 Dosing of Adult Patients Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Weight-Based Dosing Based on the weight-based dosing utilized in clinical studies with another somatropin product, the recommended dosage at the start of therapy is not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week given as a daily subcutaneous injection. The dose may be increased at 4- to 8-week intervals according to individual patient requirements to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-1 levels may be used as guidance in dose titration. Non-Weight Dosing Alternatively, taking into account recent literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15-0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-1 concentrations. During therapy, the dose should be decreased if required by the occurrence of adverse events and/or serum IGF-1 levels above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women. 2.3 Preparation and Administration OMNITROPE Cartridge 5 mg/1.5 mL and Cartridge 10 mg/1.5 mL Each cartridge of OMNITROPE must be inserted into its corresponding OMNITROPE Pen 5 or OMNITROPE Pen 10 delivery system. Instructions for delivering the dosage are provided in the OMNITROPE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE booklet enclosed with the OMNITROPE drug and the OMNITROPE Pens. OMNITROPE for injection 5.8 mg/vial Instructions for delivering the dosage are provided in the INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE leaflets enclosed with the OMNITROPE drug. Once the diluent is added to the lyophilized powder, swirl gently; do not shake. Shaking may cause denaturation of the active ingredient. Parenteral drug products should always be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. OMNITROPE MUST NOT BE INJECTED if the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter. Use it only if it is clear and colorless. OMNITROPE must be refrigerated at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Patients and caregivers who will administer OMNITROPE in medically unsupervised situations should receive appropriate training and instruction on the proper use of OMNITROPE from the physician or other suitably qualified health professional. The dosage of OMNITROPE must be adjusted for the individual patient. The dose should be given daily by subcutaneous injections (administered preferably in the evening). OMNITROPE may be given in the thigh, buttocks, or abdomen. Injection sites should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy."

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS OMNITROPE is contraindicated in patients with: \u2022 Acute Critical Illness Treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin is contraindicated in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome who are severely obese, have a history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or have severe respiratory impairment. There have been reports of sudden death when somatropin was used in such patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Active Malignancy In general, somatropin is contraindicated in the presence of active malignancy. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with somatropin. Somatropin should be discontinued if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Since GHD may be an early sign of the presence of a pituitary tumor (or, rarely, other brain tumors), the presence of such tumors should be ruled out prior to initiation of treatment. Somatropin should not be used in patients with any evidence of progression or recurrence of an underlying intracranial tumor [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity OMNITROPE is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of its excipients. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. \u2022 Diabetic Retinopathy Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \u2022 Closed Epiphyses Somatropin should not be used for growth promotion in pediatric patients with closed epiphyses. \u2022 Acute Critical Illness ( 4 ) \u2022 Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome who are severely obese or have severe respiratory impairment - reports of sudden death ( 4 ) \u2022 Active Malignancy ( 4 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity to somatropin or its excipients ( 4 ) \u2022 Active Proliferative or Severe Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( 4 ) \u2022 Children with closed epiphyses ( 4 )"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Prader-Willi Syndrome in children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome - especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (5.15) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients experiencing acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked, and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner Syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (IH) Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropins. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner Syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism and should have their thyroid function checked prior to initiation of somatropin therapy. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner Syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during OMNITROPE therapy should be evaluated for slipped capital femoral epiphysis and osteonecrosis and managed accordingly. 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated Turner Syndrome patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy . 5.12 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner Syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner Syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner Syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, hypertension) as these patients are also at risk for these conditions. 5.13 Lipoatrophy When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-1 may increase after somatropin therapy. 5.15 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner Syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain. 5.16 Benzyl Alcohol Benzyl alcohol, a component of OMNITROPE Cartridge 5 mg/1.5 mL and the diluent for OMNITROPE for injection 5.8 mg/vial, has been associated with serious adverse events and death, particularly in pediatric patients. The \u201cgasping syndrome,\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Clinical Trials in Children with SGA In clinical studies of 273 pediatric patients born small for gestational age treated with another somatropin product, the following clinically significant events were reported: mild transient hyperglycemia, one patient with benign intracranial hypertension, two patients with central precocious puberty, two patients with jaw prominence, and several patients with aggravation of preexisting scoliosis, injection site reactions, and self-limited progression of pigmented nevi. Clinical Trials in Children with Idiopathic Short Stature In two open-label clinical studies conducted with another somatropin product in pediatric patients with ISS, the most commonly encountered adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia. In one of the two studies during treatment with this other somatropin product, the mean IGF-1 standard deviation (SD) scores were maintained in the normal range. IGF-1 SD scores above +2 SD were observed as follows: 1 subject (3%), 10 subjects (30%) and 16 subjects (38%) in the untreated control, 0.23 and the 0.47 mg/kg/week groups respectively, had at least one measurement; while 0 subjects (0%), 2 subjects (7%) and 6 subjects (14%) had two or more consecutive IGF-1 measurements above +2 SD. Clinical Trials in Children with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies with another somatropin product in pediatric patients with Turner Syndrome, the most frequently reported adverse events were respiratory illnesses (influenza, tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis), joint pain, and urinary tract infection. The only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than 1 patient was joint pain. Clinical Trials in Adults with GHD In clinical trials with another somatropin product in 1,145 GHD adults, the majority of the adverse events consisted of mild to moderate symptoms of fluid retention, including peripheral swelling, arthralgia, pain and stiffness of the extremities, peripheral edema, myalgia, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia. These events were reported early during therapy, and tended to be transient and/or responsive to dosage reduction. Table 3 displays the adverse events reported by 5% or more of adult GHD patients in clinical trials after various durations of treatment with another somatropin product. Also presented are the corresponding incidence rates of these adverse events in placebo patients during the 6-month double-blind portion of the clinical trials. Table 3.

All 12 patients had predisposing factors, e.g., elevated glycated hemoglobin levels and/or marked obesity, prior to receiving this other somatropin product. Of the 3,031 patients receiving this other somatropin product, 61 (2%) developed symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which lessened after dosage reduction or treatment interruption (52) or surgery (9). Other adverse events that have been reported include generalized edema and hypoesthesia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of somatropin or OMNITROPE. Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during postmarketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), osteonecrosis (children), and pancreatitis (children and adults) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment: Should be carefully adjusted ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Insulin and/or Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment ( 7.5 ) 7.1 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen In adult women on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary OMNITROPE contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)] . Limited available data with somatropin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal studies (rats and rabbits), there was no evidence of embryo\u2011fetal or neonatal harm following somatropin administration during organogenesis at doses approximately 24 times and 19 times the recommended human therapeutic levels, respectively, based on body surface area ( see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies with somatropin during the period of organogenesis at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3.3 mg/kg/day administered subcutaneously in pregnant rats and 0.08, 0.3, and 1.3 mg/kg/day administered intramuscularly in pregnant rabbits were not teratogenic (highest doses approximately 24 times and 19 times the recommended human therapeutic levels, respectively, based on body surface area). In perinatal and postnatal studies in rats, doses of 0.3, 1, and 3.3 mg/kg/day somatropin produced growth-promoting effects in the dams but not in the fetuses. Young rats at the highest dose showed increased weight gain during suckling but the effect was not apparent by 10 weeks of age. No adverse effects were observed on gestation, morphogenesis, parturition, lactation, postnatal development, or reproductive capacity of the offspring due to somatropin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of somatropin in human milk. Limited published data indicate that exogenous somatropin does not increase normal breastmilk concentrations of growth hormone. No adverse effects related to somatropin in the breastfed infant have been reported. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for OMNITROPE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OMNITROPE or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of OMNITROPE in patients aged 65 and over have not been evaluated in clinical studies. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin (as well as endogenous GH) binds to a dimeric GH receptor in the cell membrane of target cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by IGF-1 produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis) [see Pharmacodynamics ( 12.2 )] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tissue Growth The primary and most intensively studied action of somatropin is the stimulation of linear growth. This effect is demonstrated in children with GHD and children who have PWS, were born SGA, have TS or have ISS. Skeletal Growth The measurable increase in bone length after administration of somatropin results from its effect on the cartilaginous growth areas of long bones. Studies in vitro have shown that the incorporation of sulfate into proteoglycans is not due to a direct effect of somatropin, but rather is mediated by the somatomedins or insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The somatomedins, among them IGF-1, are polypeptide hormones which are synthesized in the liver, kidney, and various other tissues. IGF-1 levels are low in the serum of hypopituitary dwarfs and hypophysectomized humans or animals and increase after treatment with somatropin. Cell Growth It has been shown that the total number of skeletal muscle cells is markedly decreased in children with short stature lacking endogenous GH compared with normal children, and that treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and size of muscle cells. Organ Growth Somatropin influences the size of internal organs, and it also increases red cell mass. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. This synthesis and growth are reflected by nitrogen retention which can be quantitated by observing the decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen following the initiation of somatropin therapy. Carbohydrate Metabolism Hypopituitary children sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that may be improved by treatment with somatropin. In healthy subjects, large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. Although the precise mechanism of the diabetogenic effect of somatropin is not known, it is attributed to blocking the action of insulin rather than blocking insulin secretion. Insulin levels in serum actually increase as somatropin levels increase. Administration of human growth hormone to normal adults and patients with growth hormone deficiency results in increases in mean serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels, although mean values remain in the normal range. In addition, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A 1C levels remain in the normal range. Lipid Metabolism Somatropin stimulates intracellular lipolysis, and administration of somatropin leads to an increase in plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides. Untreated GHD is associated with increased body fat stores, including increased abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Treatment of growth hormone deficient patients with somatropin results in a general reduction of fat stores, and decreased serum levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Mineral Metabolism Administration of somatropin results in an increase in total body potassium and phosphorus and to a lesser extent sodium. This retention is thought to be the result of cell growth. Serum levels of phosphate increase in children with GHD after somatropin therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth. Serum calcium levels are not altered. Although calcium excretion in the urine is increased, there is a simultaneous increase in calcium absorption from the intestine. Negative calcium balance, however, may occasionally occur during somatropin treatment. Connective Tissue Metabolism Somatropin stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and collagen and increases the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no pharmacokinetic studies using OMNITROPE Cartridges in patients with growth hormone deficiency. Absorption Following a subcutaneous injection of single dose of 5 mg OMNITROPE 5 mg/1.5 mL Cartridge or 5 mg OMNITROPE 10 mg/1.5 mL Cartridge in healthy male and female adults, the peak concentration (C max ) was 72-74 mcg/L. The time to reach C max (t max ) for OMNITROPE was 4.0 hours. The aqueous formulations of 5 mg/1.5 mL OMNITROPE cartridge and 10 mg/mL OMNITROPE cartridge are bioequivalent to the lyophilized 5.8 mg/vial OMNITROPE formulation. Metabolism Somatropin is metabolized in both the liver and kidneys by proteolytic degradation. In renal cells, at least a portion of the breakdown products are returned to the systemic circulation. Excretion The mean terminal half-life of somatropin after subcutaneous administration of OMNITROPE Cartridge in healthy adults is 2.5-2.8 hours. The mean clearance of subcutaneously administered OMNITROPE Cartridge in healthy adults was about 0.14 L/hr\u00b7kg. Specific Populations Pediatric: No pharmacokinetic studies of OMNITROPE have been conducted in pediatric patients. Gender: The effect of gender on pharmacokinetics of OMNITROPE has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Race: No studies have been conducted with OMNITROPE to assess pharmacokinetic differences among races. Renal or hepatic impairment: No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with OMNITROPE in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of OMNITROPE or other somatropins. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) The efficacy and safety of OMNITROPE were compared with another somatropin product approved for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in pediatric patients. In sequential clinical trials involving a total of 89 GHD children, 44 patients received OMNITROPE for Injection (lyophilized powder) 5.8 mg/vial and 45 patients received the comparator somatropin product for 9 months. After 9 months of treatment patients who had received the comparator somatropin product were switched to OMNITROPE Cartridge (liquid) 5 mg/1.5 mL. After 15 months of treatment, all patients were switched to OMNITROPE Cartridge to collect long-term efficacy and safety data. In both groups, somatropin was administered as a daily subcutaneous injection at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg. Similar effects on growth were observed between OMNITROPE for Injection and the comparator somatropin product during the initial 9 months of treatment. The efficacy results after 9 months of treatment (OMNITROPE for Injection vs. the comparator somatropin product) and after 15 months (OMNITROPE Cartridge) are summarized in Table 5. Table 5.

These trials included a 6-month double-blind treatment period, during which 85 patients received this other somatropin and 87 patients received placebo, followed by an open-label treatment period in which participating patients received this other somatropin for up to a total of 24 months. This other somatropin product was administered as a daily SC injection at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/week for the first month of treatment and 0.08 mg/kg/week for subsequent months. Beneficial changes in body composition were observed at the end of the 6-month treatment period for the patients receiving this other somatropin product as compared with the placebo patients. Lean body mass, total body water, and lean/fat ratio increased while total body fat mass and waist circumference decreased. These effects on body composition were maintained when treatment was continued beyond 6 months. Bone mineral density declined after 6 months of treatment but returned to baseline values after 12 months of treatment. 14.3 Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) The safety and efficacy of another somatropin product in the treatment of pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials. Patients received either this other somatropin product or no treatment for the first year of the studies, while all patients received this other somatropin product during the second year. This other somatropin product was administered as a daily SC injection, and the dose was calculated for each patient every 3 months. In Study 1, the treatment group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week during the entire study. During the second year, the control group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.48 mg/kg/week. In Study 2, the treatment group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.36 mg/kg/week during the entire study. During the second year, the control group received this other somatropin product at a dose of 0.36 mg/kg/week. Patients who received this other somatropin product showed significant increases in linear growth during the first year of study, compared with patients who received no treatment (see Table 6 ). Linear growth continued to increase in the second year, when both groups received treatment with this other somatropin product. Table 6.

These changes included a decrease in the amount of fat mass, and increases in the amount of lean body mass and the ratio of lean-to-fat tissue, while changes in body weight were similar to those seen in patients who received no treatment. Treatment with this other somatropin product did not accelerate bone age, compared with patients who received no treatment. Table 7.

Patients (age range of 2 to 8 years) were observed for 12 months before being randomized to receive either this other somatropin product (two doses per study, most often 0.24 and 0.48 mg/kg/week) as a daily SC injection or no treatment for the first 24 months of the studies. After 24 months in the studies, all patients received this other somatropin product. Patients who received any dose of this other somatropin product showed significant increases in growth during the first 24 months of study, compared with patients who received no treatment (see Table 8 ). Children receiving 0.48 mg/kg/week demonstrated a significant improvement in height standard deviation score (SDS) compared with children treated with 0.24 mg/kg/week. Both of these doses resulted in a slower but constant increase in growth between months 24 to 72 (data not shown). Table 8.

Patients were enrolled on the basis of short stature, stimulated GH secretion > 10 ng/mL, and prepubertal status (criteria for idiopathic short stature were retrospectively applied and included 126 patients). All patients were observed for height progression for 12 months and were subsequently randomized to this other somatropin product or observation only and followed to final height. Two somatropin doses were evaluated in this trial: 0.23 mg/kg/week (0.033 mg/kg/day) and 0.47mg/kg/week (0.067 mg/kg/day). Baseline patient characteristics for the ISS patients who remained prepubertal at randomization (n= 105) were: mean (\u00b1 SD): chronological age 11.4 (1.3) years, height SDS -2.4 (0.4), height velocity SDS -1.1 (0.8), and height velocity 4.4 (0.9) cm/yr, IGF-1 SDS -0.8 (1.4). Patients were treated for a median duration of 5.7 years. Results for final height SDS are displayed by treatment arm in Table 9. Therapy with this other somatropin product improved final height in ISS children relative to untreated controls. The observed mean gain in final height was 9.8 cm for females and 5.0 cm for males for both doses combined compared to untreated control subjects. A height gain of 1 SDS was observed in 10% of untreated subjects, 50% of subjects receiving 0.23 mg/kg/week and 69% of subjects receiving 0.47 mg/kg/week. Table 9.

Turner Syndrome patients were treated with this other somatropin product alone or this other somatropin product plus adjunctive hormonal therapy (ethinylestradiol or oxandrolone). A total of 38 patients were treated with this other somatropin product alone in the two studies. In Study 1, 22 patients were treated for 12 months, and in Study 2, 16 patients were treated for 12 months. Patients received this other somatropin product at a dose between 0.13 to 0.33 mg/kg/week. SDS for height velocity and height are expressed using either the Tanner (Study 1) or Semp\u00e9 (Study 2) standards for age-matched normal children as well as the Ranke standard (both studies) for age-matched, untreated Turner Syndrome patients. As seen in Table 10, height velocity SDS and height SDS values were smaller at baseline and after treatment with this other somatropin product when the normative standards were utilized as opposed to the Turner Syndrome standard. Both studies demonstrated statistically significant increases from baseline in all of the linear growth variables (i.e., mean height velocity, height velocity SDS, and height SDS) after treatment with this other somatropin product (see Table 10 ). The linear growth response was greater in Study 1 wherein patients were treated with a larger dose of this other somatropin product. Table 10.

Patients being treated with OMNITROPE (and/or their parents) should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with somatropin treatment. This information is intended to better educate patients (and caregivers); it is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. Patients and caregivers who will administer OMNITROPE should receive appropriate training and instruction on the proper use of OMNITROPE from the physician or other suitably qualified health care professional. A puncture-resistant container for the disposal of used syringes and needles should be strongly recommended. Patients and/or parents should be thoroughly instructed in the importance of proper disposal, and cautioned against any reuse of needles and syringes. Counsel patients and parents that they should never share an OMNITROPE Pen with another person, even if the needle is changed. Sharing of the pen between patients may pose a risk of transmission of infection. If patients are prescribed OMNITROPE Cartridge 5 mg/1.5 mL or 10 mg/1.5 mL (to be inserted into OMNITROPE Pen 5 or Pen 10 delivery systems), physicians should instruct patients to read the corresponding Instructions For Use provided with the OMNITROPE Pens delivery systems and the OMNITROPE Cartridges. If patients are prescribed OMNITROPE for injection, physicians should instruct patients to read the Instructions For Use leaflets provided with the OMNITROPE for injection 5.8 mg/vial.

Remove the Pen and cartridge from their cartons if you are preparing the injection for the first time. \u2022 Hold the body of the Pen with 1 hand and pull off the Pen cap with the other hand. See Figure B. Figure B \u2022 Hold the body of the Pen with 1 hand and unscrew the cartridge holder in a clockwise direction until the Pen and cartridge holder are completely separated. See Figure C. Figure C \u2022 Hold the cartridge in 1 hand with the metal cap end pointing down. Insert the cartridge into the cartridge holder. See Figure D. Figure D \u2022 Lower the Pen body onto the cartridge holder so that the black rod presses against the cartridge plunger. Screw the cartridge holder onto the Pen body in a counterclockwise direction until the cartridge holder will not turn anymore. One of the blue arrows on the cartridge holder must line up with the yellow line mark on the Pen body. Do not over tighten the cartridge holder. See Figure E. Figure E Step 2. Attaching the needle to the Omnitrope Pen 5 \u2022 Take a new disposable needle and tear off the paper tab. Do not touch the needle or lay it on a surface. See Figure F. Figure F \u2022 Holding the cartridge holder with 1 hand, firmly press the needle onto the cartridge holder end of the Pen. See Figure G. Screw the threaded part of the needle onto the cartridge holder in a counterclockwise direction until the needle will not turn anymore. See Figure H. Figure G Figure H \u2022 Gently pull off the outer needle shield and put it on a flat surface. You will use the outer needle shield later to remove the needle from the Pen after the injection is finished. See Figure I. Figure I Note: Check that the cartridge holder is attached to the Pen body before each injection. One of the blue arrows on the cartridge should be lined up with the yellow mark on the Pen body. After you attach the needle, you may see a few drops of medicine at the tip of the needle. Step 3. Priming a new cartridge \u2022 Priming is not needed for a cartridge you have used before. If the cartridge has already been primed, go to Step 4. \u2022 Before you use a new cartridge you must first prepare it for use. Hold the Pen with the needle pointing upwards. Gently tap the cartridge holder with your finger to help air bubbles rise to the top of the cartridge. See Figure J. Figure J \u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing up and the dose window facing you and you will see the numbers in the dose window at the bottom of the Pen body. Using the dose knob on the bottom of the Pen, slowly turn the dose knob in a clockwise direction as shown in Figure K until you hear 1 \u201cclick\u201d. The arrow on the Pen body will then be lined up with the small line between \u201c0\u201d and \u201c0.1\u201d (0.05 mg). See Figure K. Figure K \u2022 Remove the inner needle shield. See Figure L. \u2022 With the needle pointing up, firmly turn the dose knob in a counterclockwise direction and back to the \u201c0\u201d position. Figure L At least 2 drops of medicine must flow out of the needle for the Pen to be properly primed. See Figure M. Figure M \u2022 If at least 2 drops of medicine do not flow out, set the dose to 0.05 mg and repeat this step until at least 2 drops of medicine appear at the tip of the needle. \u2022 When you see 2 drops of medicine flow out of the needle, the Pen is correctly primed and ready to use. Step 4. Selecting the correct dose of Omnitrope \u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing up and the dose window facing you and turn (dial) the dose knob in a clockwise direction until you see the number of mg for the prescribed dose in the middle of the dose window. The dose should be lined up with the arrow on the Pen body. You will hear 1 click for every single unit you dial. See Figure N. Do not count the clicks to measure the correct dose of medicine. Figure N \u2022 If you turn the dose knob past the correct dose, do not dial counterclockwise. Instead, hold the Pen body with the needle pointing up and turn the dose knob in a clockwise direction until you see a bent arrow ( ) in the dose dialing window. See Figure O. Now continue to turn the dose knob in a clockwise direction until you hear a click and the entire Pen body is fully extended. The injection button can now be fully pressed, resetting the dial to \u201c0\u201d without giving medicine. The correct dose can now be redialed. Figure O \u2022 Check that the cartridge holder is still attached to the Pen body, with the blue arrow lined up with the yellow mark on the Pen body. Step 5. Selecting the injection site and injecting the dose of Omnitrope The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle such as the upper leg (thigh), buttocks, or stomach area (abdomen) as in the picture shown below. Do not inject near your belly button (navel) or waistline . Change the injection site every day. See Figure P. Figure P \u2022 Select the injection site and wipe the skin with an alcohol swab as your healthcare provider showed you. \u2022 With 1 hand, pinch a fold of loose skin at the injection site. \u2022 With your other hand, insert the needle under the skin (at an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) as your healthcare provider showed you. See Figure Q. Figure Q \u2022 After inserting the needle into the skin, push the injection button as far in as it will go and press the button firmly. A clicking sound will be heard while the dose is being injected. Continue to press firmly on the injection button for 5 seconds before you remove the needle from the skin. See Figure R. Figure R \u2022 Stop pressing the injection button before you carefully remove the needle from the skin. \u2022 If the injection button cannot be pushed in completely or stops during the injection, and the cartridge is empty, then the full dose has not been given. The dose indicator window will show the amount of medicine still needed. Reset the dose knob to \u201c0\u201d as described in Step 4. Remove the needle as described in Step 6. Replace the empty cartridge with a new cartridge as described in Step 1. Prime the new cartridge as described in Step 3. Set the dose, which you noted, and inject. This completes your dose. Step 6. Removing and throwing away the needle and empty cartridge \u2022 Carefully replace the outer needle shield. See Figure S. Figure S \u2022 Hold the Pen by the cartridge holder and carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle in a clockwise direction. See Figure T. Recap the pen. Figure T \u2022 Put your used needles and cartridges in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use.

Do not inject OMNITROPE yourself until your healthcare provider has taught you and you understand the instructions. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any questions about injecting OMNITROPE. \u2022 OMNITROPE 5.8 mg is for Single-Patient-Use. \u2022 The concentration of OMNITROPE after mixing is 5 mg/mL. \u2022 After mixing, OMNITROPE 5.8 mg contains a preservative and should not be used in newborns. Preparation Collect the needed items before you begin: \u2022 a vial with OMNITROPE 5.8 mg \u2022 a vial with diluent (mixing liquid - Bacteriostatic Water for Injection containing benzyl alcohol as preservative) for OMNITROPE 5.8 mg \u2022 a sterile, disposable 3 mL syringe and needle for withdrawing the diluent from the vial (not supplied in the pack) \u2022 sterile disposable 1 mL syringes and needles for under the skin (subcutaneous) injection (not supplied in the pack) \u2022 2 alcohol swabs (not supplied in the pack) Wash your hands before you start with the next steps. Mixing OMNITROPE 5.8 mg \u2022 Remove the protective caps from the two vials. With one alcohol swab, clean both the rubber top of the vial that contains the powder and the rubber top of the vial that contains diluent. \u2022 Next use the sterile diluent vial, the disposal 3 mL syringe and a needle. \u2022 Attach the needle to the syringe (if not attached already). Pull back the syringe plunger and fill the syringe with air. Push the needle fitted to the syringe through the rubber top of the diluent vial, push all the air from the syringe into the vial, turn the vial upside down, and withdraw all the diluent from the vial into the syringe. Remove the syringe and needle. \u2022 Next take the syringe with the diluent in it and push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial that contains the white powder. Inject the diluent slowly. Aim the stream of liquid against the glass wall in order to avoid foam. Remove the syringe and needle and throw them away. \u2022 Gently swirl the vial until the content is completely dissolved. Do not shake. \u2022 If the medicine is cloudy or contains particles, it should not be used. The medicine must be clear and colorless after mixing. \u2022 After mixing the medicine, the medicine in the vial must be used within 3 weeks. Store the vial in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) after mixing and using it each time. Measuring the Dose of OMNITROPE 5.8 mg to Be Injected \u2022 Next use the sterile, disposable 1 mL (or similar) syringe and needle for subcutaneous injection. Push the needle through the rubber top of the vial that contains the medicine that you have just mixed. \u2022 Turn the vial and the syringe upside down. \u2022 Be sure the tip of the syringe is in the OMNITROPE mixed medicine. \u2022 Pull back on the plunger slowly and withdraw the dose prescribed by your healthcare provider into the syringe. \u2022 Hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up and remove the syringe from the vial. \u2022 Check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubble disappears. Push the plunger slowly back up to the correct dose. If there is not enough medicine in the syringe after removing the air bubbles, draw more medicine into the syringe from the mixed medicine vial and repeat checking for bubbles. \u2022 Look at the mixed medicine in the syringe before using. Do not use if discolored or particles are present. You are now ready to inject the dose. Injecting OMNITROPE 5.8 mg \u2022 Choose the site of injection on your body. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle such as the upper leg (thigh), buttocks, or stomach area (abdomen) as in the picture shown below. Do not inject near your belly button (navel) or waistline. \u2022 Make sure you rotate the injection sites on your body. Inject at least 1/2 inch from the last injection. Change the places on your body where you inject, as instructed by your healthcare provider. \u2022 Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol swab. Wait for the area to air dry. \u2022 With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin at the injection site. With your other hand, hold the syringe as you would hold a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin straight in or at a slight angle (an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0). After the needle is in, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. Pull back the plunger very slightly with one hand. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. Do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure at a different site. If no blood comes into the syringe, inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. \u2022 Pull the needle straight out of the skin. After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if needed for bleeding, for several seconds. Do not massage or rub the injection site. After Injecting OMNITROPE 5.8 mg \u2022 Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and cartridges. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION SEROSTIM is administered by subcutaneous injection. SEROSTIM therapy should be carried out under the regular guidance of a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of HIV infection. The recommended dose of SEROSTIM is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) daily (up to 6 mg) at bedtime for HIV patients with wasting or cachexia ( 2.1 ) Injection sites, which may be located on thigh, upper arm, abdomen or buttock, should be rotated to avoid local irritation ( 2.2 ) 2.1 HIV-associated wasting or cachexia The usual starting dose of SEROSTIM is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily (up to a total dose of 6 mg). SEROSTIM should be administered subcutaneously once daily at bedtime according to the following body weight-based dosage recommendations: Weight Range Dose >55kg (>121 lb) 6 mg Based on an approximate daily dosage of 0.1 mg/kg. SC daily 45-55 kg (99-121 lb) 5 mg SC daily 35-45 kg (75-99 lb) 4 mg SC daily <35 kg (<75 lb) 0.1 mg/kg SC daily Treatment with SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg every other day was associated with fewer side effects, and resulted in a similar improvement in work output, as compared with SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily. Therefore, a starting dose of SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg every other day should be considered in patients at increased risk for adverse effects related to recombinant human growth hormone therapy (i.e., glucose intolerance). In general, dose reductions (i.e., reducing the total daily dose or the number of doses per week) should be considered for side effects potentially related to recombinant human growth hormone therapy. Most of the effect of SEROSTIM on work output and lean body mass was apparent after 12 weeks of treatment. The effect was maintained during an additional 12 weeks of therapy. There are no safety or efficacy data available from controlled studies in which patients were treated with SEROSTIM continuously for more than 48 weeks. There are no safety or efficacy data available from trials in which patients with HIV wasting or cachexia were treated intermittently with SEROSTIM. 2.2 Preparation and Administration Each vial of SEROSTIM 5 mg or 6 mg is reconstituted with 0.5 to 1 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Each vial of SEROSTIM 4 mg is reconstituted in 0.5 to 1 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% Benzyl Alcohol preserved). For patients sensitive to Benzyl Alcohol, SEROSTIM may be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP [see Pediatric Use (8.4) ]. When SEROSTIM is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately and any unused portion should be discarded. When SEROSTIM is reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% Benzyl Alcohol preserved) the reconstituted solution may be refrigerated (2-8\u00b0C/36-46\u00b0F) for up to 14 days. Approximately 10% mechanical loss can be associated with reconstitution and administration from multi-dose vials. To reconstitute SEROSTIM, inject the diluent into the vial of SEROSTIM aiming the liquid against the glass vial wall. Swirl the vial with a GENTLE rotary motion until contents are dissolved completely. DO NOT SHAKE. Parenteral drug products should always be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. SEROSTIM MUST NOT BE INJECTED if the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter. Use it only if it is clear and colorless. SEROSTIM can be administered using (1) a standard sterile, disposable syringe and needle, (2) a compatible SEROSTIM needle-free injection device or (3) a compatible SEROSTIM needle injection device. For proper use, refer to the Instructions for Use provided with the administration device. Injection sites, which may be located on the thigh, upper arm, abdomen or buttock, should be rotated to avoid local irritation."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Acute Critical Illness Growth hormone therapy should not be initiated in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Active Malignancy In general, somatropin is contraindicated in the presence of active malignancy. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with somatropin. Somatropin should be discontinued if there is evidence of recurrent activity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypersensitivity SEROSTIM is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of its excipients. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Diabetic Retinopathy Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Critical Illness: Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin ( 5.1 ) Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy: In vitro experimental systems have demonstrated the potential to potentiate HIV replication. No significant somatropin-associated increase in viral load was observed in clinical trials. HIV patients should be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for the duration of SEROSTIM treatment ( 5.2 ) Neoplasms: Monitor all patients with a history of any neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression, recurrences, or development of a tumor ( 5.3 ) Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels. Dose adjustment of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may be required ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction ( 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention ( 5.6 ) Fluid Retention (edema, arthralgia)/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary ( 5.7 ) Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.2 Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy In some experimental systems, somatropin has been shown to potentiate HIV replication in vitro at concentrations ranging from 50-250 ng/mL. There was no increase in virus production when the antiretroviral agents, zidovudine, didanosine or lamivudine were added to the culture medium. Additional in vitro studies have shown that somatropin does not interfere with the antiviral activity of zalcitabine or stavudine. In the controlled clinical trials, no significant somatropin-associated increase in viral burden was observed. However, the protocol required all participants to be on concomitant antiretroviral therapy for the duration of the study. In view of the potential for acceleration of virus replication, it is recommended that HIV patients be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for the duration of SEROSTIM treatment. 5.3 Neoplasms Because malignancies are more common in HIV positive individuals, the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in HIV positive patients should be carefully considered before initiating SEROSTIM treatment and patients should be monitored carefully for the development of neoplasms if treatment with somatropin is initiated. Monitor all patients with a history of any neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor [see Contraindications (4) ]. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes Hyperglycemia may occur in HIV infected individuals due to a variety of reasons. In wasting patients, treatment with SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily and 0.1 mg/kg every other day for 12 weeks was associated with approximately 10 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL increases in mean fasting blood glucose concentrations, respectively. The increases occurred early in treatment. Patients with other risk factors for glucose intolerance should be monitored closely during SEROSTIM therapy. During safety surveillance of patients with HIV-associated wasting, cases of new onset impaired glucose tolerance, new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving SEROSTIM. Some patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic coma. In some patients, these conditions improved when SEROSTIM was discontinued, while in others, the glucose intolerance persisted. Some of these patients required initiation or adjustment of antidiabetic treatment while on SEROSTIM. In clinical trials of SEROSTIM conducted in HIV patients with lipodystrophy (an unapproved indication), evidence of dose-dependent glucose intolerance and related adverse reaction was observed at doses of 4 mg SEROSTIM daily and 4 mg SEROSTIM every other day for 12 weeks [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Fluid Retention/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Increased tissue turgor (swelling, particularly in the hands and feet) and musculoskeletal discomfort (pain, swelling and/or stiffness) may occur during treatment with SEROSTIM, but may resolve spontaneously, with analgesic therapy, or after reducing the frequency of dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Carpal tunnel syndrome may occur during treatment with SEROSTIM. If the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome do not resolve by decreasing the weekly number of doses of SEROSTIM, it is recommended that treatment be discontinued. 5.8 Lipoatrophy When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.9 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child who develops abdominal pain."

Clinical trials in HIV-associated wasting or cachexia: In the 12-week, placebo-controlled Clinical Trial 2, 510 patients were treated with SEROSTIM. The most common adverse reactions judged to be associated with SEROSTIM were musculoskeletal discomfort and increased tissue turgor (swelling, particularly of the hands or feet), and were more frequently observed when SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg was administered on a daily basis [Table 1 and Warnings and Precautions (5)]. These symptoms often subsided with continued treatment or dose reduction. Approximately 23% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily and 11% of patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg every other day required dose reductions. Discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 10.3% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily and 6.6% of patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg every other day. The most common reasons for dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation were arthralgia, myalgia, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, elevated glucose levels, and elevated triglyceride levels. Clinical adverse reactions which occurred during the first 12 weeks of study in at least 5% of the patients in either active treatment group and at an incidence greater than placebo are listed below, without regard to causality assessment.

During the 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Trial 2, the incidence of hyperglycemia reported as an adverse reaction was 3.6% for the placebo group, 1.9% for the 0.1 mg/kg every other day group and 3.2% for the 0.1 mg/kg daily group. One case of diabetes mellitus was noted in the 0.1 mg/kg daily group during the first 12-weeks of therapy. In addition, during the extension phase of Clinical Trial 2, two patients converted from placebo to full dose SEROSTIM, and 1 patient converted from placebo to half-dose SEROSTIM, were discontinued because of the development of diabetes mellitus. The types and incidences of adverse reactions reported during the Clinical Trial 2 extension phase were not different from, or greater in frequency than those observed during the 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Trial 2. Adverse reactions from treatment with SEROSTIM in clinical trials in HIV lipodystrophy SEROSTIM was evaluated for the treatment of patients with HIV lipodystrophy in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that excluded patients with a history of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose (approximately 20% of the patients screened were excluded from study enrollment as a result of a diagnosis of diabetes or glucose intolerance). The studies included a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group \"induction\" phase followed by maintenance phases of different durations (12 and 24 weeks, respectively). In the initial 12-week treatment periods of the two, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 406 patients were treated with SEROSTIM. Clinical adverse reactions which occurred during the first 12 weeks of both studies combined in at least 5% of the patients in either of the two active treatment groups are listed by treatment group in Table 2, without regard to causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions judged to be associated with SEROSTIM were edema, arthralgia, pain in extremity, hypoesthesia, myalgia, and blood glucose increased, all of which were more frequently observed when SEROSTIM 4 mg was administered on a daily basis compared with alternate days. These symptoms often subsided with dose reduction. During the 12-week induction phase, 1) approximately 26% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 4 mg daily and 19% of patients receiving SEROSTIM4 mg every other day required dose reductions; and 2) discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 4 mg daily and 5% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day. The most common reasons for dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation were peripheral edema, hyperglycemia (including blood glucose increased, blood glucose abnormal, and hyperglycemia), and arthralgia.

Twenty-three patients discontinued due to hyperglycemia while receiving SEROSTIM during any phase of these studies (3.2% in the 12-week induction phases and 2.1% in the extension phases). Breast-Related Terms: When grouped together, breast-related adverse reactions (e.g. nipple pain, gynecomastia, breast pain/mass/tenderness/swelling/edema/hypertrophy) had an incidence of 1% for the placebo group, 3% for the SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day group and 6% for the SEROSTIM 4 mg daily group. Adverse reactions that occurred in 1% to less than 5% of trial participants receiving SEROSTIM during the first 12 weeks of HIV Lipodystrophy Studies 1 and 2 thought to be related to SEROSTIM include carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel's sign and facial edema. The adverse reactions reported for SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day during the maintenance phase of HIV Lipodystrophy Study 1 (Week 12 to Week 24) were similar in frequency and quality to those observed after treatment with SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day during the 12-week induction phase. IGF-1 serum concentrations increased statistically in SEROSTIM-treated patients when compared to placebo (Table 3). In the SEROSTIM treated patients at baseline, the proportion of subjects with serum IGF-1 SDS levels \u2265 +2 was approximately 10 to 20%, while with treatment with either dose regimen of SEROSTIM the percentage increased to 80 to 90% by Week 12.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influences by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SEROSTIM with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. After 12 weeks of treatment, none of the 651 study participants with HIV-associated wasting treated with SEROSTIM for the first time developed detectable antibodies to growth hormone (> 4 pg binding). Patients were not rechallenged. Data beyond 3 months is not available. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of SEROSTIM. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Endocrine: new onset impaired glucose tolerance new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus diabetic ketoacidosis diabetic coma In some patients, these conditions improved when SEROSTIM was discontinued, while in others the glucose intolerance persisted. Some of these patients required initiation or adjustment of antidiabetic treatment while on SEROSTIM [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. No data are available on drug interactions between SEROSTIM and HIV protease inhibitors or the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Inhibition of 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses ( 7.1 ) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin ( 7.2 ) Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women ( 7.3 ) Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment ( 7.4 ) 7.1 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 The microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Somatropin inhibits 11\u03b2HSD-1. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. 7.2 Cytochrome P450-metabolized drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Therefore, careful monitoring is advised when somatropin is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.3 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 7.4 Insulin and/or Other Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents Patients with diabetes mellitus who receive concomitant treatment with somatropin may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. Doses up to 5 to 10 times the human dose, based on body surface area, have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to SEROSTIM. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, SEROSTIM should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Women It is not known whether SEROSTIM is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when SEROSTIM is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with HIV have not been established. Available evidence suggests that somatropin clearance is similar in adults and children, but no pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children with HIV. In two small studies, 11 children with HIV-associated failure to thrive were treated subcutaneously with human growth hormone. In one study, five children (age range, 6 to 17 years) were treated with 0.04 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. In a second study, six children (age range, 8 to 14 years) were treated with 0.07 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Treatment appeared to be well tolerated in both studies. The preliminary data collected on a limited number of patients with HIV-associated failure to thrive appear to be consistent with safety observations in growth hormone-treated adults with HIV wasting. Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse events and death, particularly in pediatric patients. The \"gasping syndrome,\" (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with SEROSTIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore, may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been conducted for SEROSTIM in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Subjects with chronic renal failure tend to have decreased somatropin clearance compared to those with normal renal function. However, no studies have been conducted for SEROSTIM in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Gender Effect Biomedical literature indicates that a gender-related difference in the mean clearance of r-hGH could exist (clearance of r-hGH in males > clearance of r-hGH in females). However, no gender-based analysis is available for SEROSTIM in normal volunteers or patients infected with HIV."

Doses up to 5 to 10 times the human dose, based on body surface area, have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to SEROSTIM. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, SEROSTIM should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with HIV have not been established. Available evidence suggests that somatropin clearance is similar in adults and children, but no pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children with HIV. In two small studies, 11 children with HIV-associated failure to thrive were treated subcutaneously with human growth hormone. In one study, five children (age range, 6 to 17 years) were treated with 0.04 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. In a second study, six children (age range, 8 to 14 years) were treated with 0.07 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Treatment appeared to be well tolerated in both studies. The preliminary data collected on a limited number of patients with HIV-associated failure to thrive appear to be consistent with safety observations in growth hormone-treated adults with HIV wasting. Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse events and death, particularly in pediatric patients. The \"gasping syndrome,\" (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

      "11 DESCRIPTION SEROSTIM is a human growth hormone (hGH) produced by recombinant DNA technology. SEROSTIM has 191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 daltons. Its amino acid sequence and structure are identical to the dominant form of human pituitary growth hormone. SEROSTIM is produced by a mammalian cell line (mouse C127) that has been modified by the addition of the hGH gene. SEROSTIM is secreted directly through the cell membrane into the cell-culture medium for collection and purification. SEROSTIM is a sterile lyophilized powder intended for subcutaneous injection after reconstitution to its liquid form. Vials of SEROSTIM contain either 4 mg, 5 mg, or 6 mg. Each vial contains the following: Vials 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Component Somatropin 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg Sucrose 27.3 mg 34.2 mg 41 mg Phosphoric acid 0.9 mg 1.2 mg 1.4 mg Each 4 mg multi-vial is supplied in a combination package with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% Benzyl Alcohol).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action SEROSTIM is an anabolic and anticatabolic agent which exerts its influence by interacting with specific receptors on a variety of cell types including myocytes, hepatocytes, adipocytes, lymphocytes, and hematopoietic cells. Some, but not all of its effects, are mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Protein, Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism A one-week study in 6 patients with HIV-associated wasting has shown that treatment with SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg/day improved nitrogen balance, increased protein-sparing lipid oxidation, and had little effect on overall carbohydrate metabolism. Decreases in trunk fat and total body fat, and increases in lean body mass were observed during two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies wherein SEROSTIM vs. placebo were administered daily for 12 weeks to patients with HIV Lipodystrophy [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Effects on Nitrogen and Mineral Retention In the one-week study in 6 patients with HIV-associated wasting, treatment with SEROSTIM resulted in the retention of phosphorous, potassium, nitrogen, and sodium. The ratio of retained potassium and nitrogen during SEROSTIM therapy was consistent with retention of these elements in lean tissue. Physical Performance Cycle ergometry work output and treadmill performance were examined in separate 12-week, placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In both studies, work output improved significantly in the group receiving SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously vs placebo. Isometric muscle performance, as measured by grip strength dynamometry, declined, probably as a result of a transient increase in tissue turgor known to occur with SEROSTIM therapy. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous administration was determined to be 70 to 90%. The mean t\u00bd after subcutaneous administration is significantly longer than that seen after intravenous administration in normal male volunteers down-regulated with somatostatin (approximately 4.0 hrs. vs. 0.6 hrs.), indicating that the subcutaneous absorption of somatropin is a rate-limiting process. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution (Mean \u00b1 SD) following intravenous administration of somatropin in normal male volunteers is 12.0 \u00b1 1.08 L. Metabolism: Although the liver plays a role in the metabolism of GH, GH is primarily cleaved in the kidney. GH undergoes glomerular filtration and, after cleavage within the renal cells, the peptides and amino acids are returned to the systemic circulation. Elimination: The t\u00bd in nine patients with HIV-associated wasting with an average weight of 56.7 \u00b1 6.8 kg, given a fixed dose of 6.0 mg somatropin subcutaneously was 4.28 \u00b1 2.15 hrs, similar to that observed in normal male volunteers. The renal clearance of r-hGH after subcutaneous administration in nine patients with HIV-associated wasting was 0.0015 \u00b1 0.0037 L/h. No significant accumulation of r-hGH appears to occur after 6 weeks of daily dosing as indicated. Specific Populations: Pediatric: Available evidence suggests that r-hGH clearances are similar in adults and children, but no pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children with HIV. Gender: Biomedical literature indicates that a gender-related difference in the mean clearance of r-hGH could exist (clearance of r-hGH in males > clearance of r-hGH in females). However, no gender-based analysis is available in normal volunteers or patients infected with HIV. Race: No studies have been conducted to determine the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of SEROSTIM. Renal Impairment: Subjects with chronic renal failure tend to have decreased somatropin clearance compared to those with normal renal function. However, no studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SEROSTIM. Hepatic Impairment: No studies have been conducted to determine the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetic of SEROSTIM."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES HIV-Associated Wasting or Cachexia The clinical efficacy of SEROSTIM in HIV-associated wasting or cachexia was assessed in two placebo-controlled trials. All study subjects received concomitant antiretroviral therapy. There was no increase in the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), lymphoma, or in the progression of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma in clinical studies of SEROSTIM. Patients with internal KS lesions were excluded from the studies. Potential effects on other malignancies are unknown. Clinical Trial 1: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open-label extension phase enrolled 178 patients with severe HIV wasting taking nucleoside analogue therapy (pre-HAART era). The primary endpoint was body weight. Body composition was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and physical function was assessed by treadmill exercise testing. Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were treated with either placebo or SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily. Ninety-six percent (96%) were male. The average baseline CD4 count/microliter was 85. The results from one hundred forty (140) evaluable patients were analyzed (those completing the 12-week course of treatment and who were at least 80% compliant with study drug). After 12 weeks of therapy, the mean difference in weight increase between the SEROSTIM-treated group and the placebo-treated group was 1.6 kg (3.5 lb). Mean difference in lean body mass (LBM) change between the SEROSTIM-treated group and the placebo-treated group was 3.1 kg (6.8 lbs) as measured by DXA. Mean increase in weight and LBM, and mean decrease in body fat, were significantly greater in the SEROSTIM-treated group than in the placebo group (p=0.011, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively) after 12 weeks of treatment (Figure 1). There were no significant changes with continued treatment beyond 12 weeks suggesting that the original gains of weight and LBM were maintained (Figure 1). Treatment with SEROSTIM resulted in a significant increase in physical function as assessed by treadmill exercise testing. The median treadmill work output increased by 13% (p=0.039) at 12 weeks in the group receiving SEROSTIM (Figure 2). There was no improvement in the placebo-treated group at 12 weeks. Changes in treadmill performance were significantly correlated with changes in LBM. Figure 1: Mean Changes in Body Composition Figure 2: Median Treadmill Work Output Figure 1 Figure 2 Clinical Trial 2: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 757 patients with HIV-associated wasting, or cachexia. The primary efficacy endpoint was physical function as measured by cycle ergometry work output. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and also by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at a subset of centers. Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were treated with either placebo, approximately 0.1 mg/kg every other day (qod) of SEROSTIM, or approximately 0.1 mg/kg daily at bedtime of SEROSTIM. All results were analyzed in intent-to-treat populations (for cycle ergometry work output, n=670). Ninety-one percent (91%) were male and 88% were on HAART anti-retroviral therapy. The average baseline CD4 count/\u00b5L was 446. Six hundred forty-six patients (646) completed the 12-week study and continued in the SEROSTIM treatment extension phase of the trial. Clinical Trial 2 results are summarized in Tables 4 and 5: Table 4: Mean (Median) of Cycle Work Output (kJ) Response after 12 weeks of Treatment ITT Population Placebo Half-Dose SEROSTIM approximately 0.1 mg/kg every other day Full-Dose SEROSTIM approximately 0.1 mg/kg daily Cycle work output (kJ) n=222 n=230 n=218 Baseline 25.92 (25.05) 27.79 (26.65) 27.57 (26.30) Change from baseline -0.05 (-0.25) 2.48 (2.30) 2.52 (2.40) Percent change from baseline 0.2% 8.9% 9.1% Difference from Placebo Mean (2-sided 95% C.I.) - 2.53 p<0.01 (0.81, 4.25) 2.57 (0.83, 4.31) Median - 2.55 2.65 Table 5: Mean (Median) Change from Baseline for Lean Body Mass, Fat Mass and Body Weight Placebo Half-Dose SEROSTIM approximately 0.1 mg/kg every other day Full-Dose SEROSTIM approximately 0.1 mg/kg daily N Mean (Median) n Mean (Median) n Mean (Median) Lean body mass (kg) (by BIS) 222 0.97 (0.67) 223 3.89 (3.65) 205 5.84 (5.47) Fat mass (kg) (by DXA) 94 0.03 (0.01) 100 -1.25 (-1.23) 85 -1.72 (-1.51) Body weight (kg) 247 0.69 (0.68) 257 2.18 (2.15) 253 2.79 (2.65) The mean maximum cycle work output until exhaustion increased after 12 weeks by 2.57 kilojoules (kJ) in the SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily group (p<0.01) and by 2.53 kJ in the SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg every other day group (p<0.01) compared with placebo (Table 4). Cycle work output improved approximately 9% in both active treatment arms and decreased <1% in the placebo group. Lean body mass (LBM) and body weight (BW) increased, and fat mass decreased, in a dose-related fashion after treatment with SEROSTIMand placebo (Table 5). The LBM results obtained by BIS were confirmed with DXA. Patients' perceptions of the impact of 12 weeks of treatment on their wasting symptoms as assessed by the Bristol-Meyers Anorexia/Cachexia Recovery Instrument improved with both doses of SEROSTIMin Clinical Trial 2. Extension Phase: All patients (n=646) completing the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of Clinical Trial 2 continued SEROSTIM treatment into an extension phase. Five hundred and forty eight of these patients completed an additional 12 weeks of active treatment. In these patients, changes in cycle ergometry work output, LBM, BW, and fat mass either improved further or were maintained with continued SEROSTIM treatment."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer by subcutaneous injection to the back of upper arm, abdomen, buttock, or thigh with regular rotation of injection sites ( 2.1 ) Pediatric dosage: Divide the calculated weekly dosage into equal doses given either 3, 6, or 7 days per week ( 2.2 ) GH deficiency : 0.18 mg/kg/week to 0.3 mg/kg/week ( 2.2 ) Turner syndrome: Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week ( 2.2 ) ISS : Up to 0.37 mg/kg/week ( 2.2 ) SHOX deficiency: 0.35 mg/kg/week ( 2.2 ) SGA: Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week ( 2.2 ) Adult dosage: Either of the following two dosing regimens may be used: Non-weight based dosing : Initiate with a dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15 mg/day to 0.3 mg/day) and increase the dose every 1 to 2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 mg/day to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements ( 2.3 ) Weight-based dosing (Not recommended for obese patients) : Initiate at 0.006 mg/kg daily and increase the dose according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.0125 mg/kg daily ( 2.3 ) See Full Prescribing Information for reconstitution instructions ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Administration and Use Instructions Therapy with ZOMACTON should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with the conditions for which ZOMACTON is indicated [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with ZOMACTON to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Administer ZOMACTON by subcutaneous injection to the back of the upper arm, abdomen, buttock, or thigh with regular rotation of injection sites to avoid lipoatrophy. ZOMACTON 5 mg and 10 mg can be administered using a standard sterile disposable syringe. For proper use, please refer to the Instructions for Use provided with the administration device. The volume of the syringe should be small enough so that the prescribed dose can be withdrawn from the vial with reasonable accuracy. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage Individualize dosage for each patient based on the growth response. Divide the calculated weekly ZOMACTON dosage into equal doses given either 3, 6, or 7 days per week. The recommended weekly dose in milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight for pediatric patients is: Pediatric GH Deficiency: 0.18 mg/kg/week to 0.3 mg/kg/week (0.026 mg/kg/day to 0.043 mg/kg/day) Turner syndrome: Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week (up to 0.054 mg/kg/day) Idiopathic short stature: Up to 0.37 mg/kg/week (up to 0.053 mg/kg/day) SHOX Deficiency: 0.35 mg/kg/week (0.05 mg/kg/day) Small for Gestational Age (SGA): Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day) In very short pediatric patients, HSDS less than -3, and older pubertal pediatric patients consider initiating treatment with a larger dose of ZOMACTON (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day). Consider a gradual reduction in dosage if substantial catch-up growth is observed during the first few years of therapy. In pediatric patients less than 4 years of age with less severe short stature, baseline HSDS values between -2 and -3, consider initiating treatment at 0.033 mg/kg/day and titrate the dose as needed. Assess compliance and evaluate other causes of poor growth such as hypothyroidism, under-nutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human GH if patients experience failure to increase height velocity, particularly during the first year of treatment. Discontinue ZOMACTON for stimulation of linear growth once epiphyseal fusion has occurred [see Contraindications (4) ]. 2.3 Adult Dosage Patients who were treated with somatropin for GH deficiency in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin for GH deficient adults. Consider using a lower starting dose and smaller dose increment increases for geriatric patients as they may be at increased risk for adverse reactions with ZOMACTON than younger individuals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Estrogen-replete women and patients receiving oral estrogen may require higher doses [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Administer the prescribed dose daily Either of two ZOMACTON dosing regimens may be used: Non-weight based Initiate ZOMACTON with a dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15 mg/day to 0.3 mg/day) and increase the dose every 1 to 2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 mg/day to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations. Decrease the dose as necessary on the basis of adverse reactions and/or serum IGF-1 concentrations above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages will vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients. Weight-based Initiate ZOMACTON at 0.006 mg/kg daily and increase the dose according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.0125 mg/kg daily. Use the patient's clinical response, adverse reactions, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-1 concentrations as guidance in dose titration. Not recommended for obese patients as they are more likely to experience adverse reactions with this regimen. 2.4 Reconstitution Reconstitute ZOMACTON 5 mg with 1 mL to 5 mL of diluent, Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection, USP with 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Do not use diluent if the patient has a known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol [see Contraindications (4) ] or in neonates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] , or pregnant or lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] instead reconstitute with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, use only one dose per vial, and discard the unused portion. Reconstitute ZOMACTON 10 mg with 1 mL syringe of diluent, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP with 0.33% metacresol as a preservative. Do not use diluent if the patient has a known hypersensitivity to metacresol [see Contraindications (4) ] . Aim the stream of diluent against the side of the vial to prevent foaming and gently swirl the vial with a rotary motion until the contents are completely dissolved and the solution is clear. Do not shake the vial since shaking or vigorous mixing will cause the solution to be cloudy. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration. If the resulting solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter do not use. Occasionally, after refrigeration, some cloudiness may occur. Allow the product to warm to room temperature. If cloudiness persists or particulate matter is noted do not use."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Neoplasm: Second neoplasms have occurred in childhood cancer survivors. Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. ( 5.3 ) Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: ZOMACTON may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving ZOMACTON, especially in patients with existing diabetes mellitus or at risk for development. ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (IH): Has been reported usually within 8 weeks of initiation. Perform fundoscopic examinations prior to initiation and periodically thereafter. If papilledema occurs, stop treatment. ( 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention. ( 5.6 ) Fluid Retention: May occur in adults and may be dose dependent. ( 5.7 ) Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism. ( 5.8 ) Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as hypothyroidism may occur or worsen after initiation of somatropin. ( 5.9 ) Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients: May occur; evaluate patients with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain. ( 5.10 ) Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients: Monitor patients with scoliosis for progression. ( 5.11 ) Pancreatitis: Has been reported; consider pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain, especially pediatric patients. ( 5.12 ) Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including the diluent for ZOMACTON 5 mg. If administering ZOMACTON 5 mg to infants, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic doses of somatropin [see Contraindications (4) ] . Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-GH deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3 mg/day-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing ZOMACTON treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. ZOMACTON is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults. 5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of, or increased, snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4) ] . ZOMACTON is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.3 Increased Risk of Neoplasms Active Malignancy There is an increased risk of malignancy progression with somatropin treatment in patients with active malignancy [see Contraindications (4) ]. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with ZOMACTON. Discontinue ZOMACTON if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Risk of Second Neoplasm in Pediatric Patients There is an increased risk of a second neoplasm in pediatric cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head and who developed subsequent GH deficiency and were treated with somatropin. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence. Monitor all patients receiving ZOMACTON who have a history of GH deficiency secondary to an intracranial neoplasm for progression or recurrence of the tumor. New Malignancy During Treatment Because pediatric patients with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting ZOMACTON in these patients. If ZOMACTON is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor all patients receiving ZOMACTON carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. Advise patients/caregivers to report marked changes in behavior, onset of headaches, vision disturbances and/or changes in skin pigmentation or changes in the appearance of pre-existing nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. New onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving ZOMACTON, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely. The doses of antidiabetic agents may require adjustment when ZOMACTON is initiated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms resolved rapidly after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with ZOMACTON to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with ZOMACTON can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of ZOMACTON. Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed or untreated hypothyroidism may prevent response to ZOMACTON, in particular, the growth response in pediatric patients. Patients with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests performed, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients undergoing rapid growth. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin. Evaluate pediatric patients receiving ZOMACTON with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain for slipped capital femoral epiphysis and osteonecrosis and manage accordingly. 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Somatropin increases the growth rate and progression of existing scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for progression of scoliosis. 5.12 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in pediatric patients and adults receiving somatropin. The risk may be greater in pediatric patients compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other pediatric patients receiving somatropin. Pancreatitis should be considered in patients who develop abdominal pain. 5.13 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preserved Solution Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \"gasping syndrome\" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including the bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride diluent provided with ZOMACTON 5 mg. The \"gasping syndrome\" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When administering ZOMACTON 5 mg to infants, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, not with the diluent provided. Use only one dose per vial and discard the unused portion [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.14 Lipoatrophy When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering ZOMACTON to reduce this risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.15 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and IGF-1 may increase after ZOMACTON treatment."

Pediatric Patients Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone ZOMACTON was evaluated in 164 pediatric patients with short stature due to GHD in an open-label study for 24 weeks. The subjects ranged in age from 2.1 to 17.7 years with a mean of 10.8 years. One hundred twenty (73%) of the subjects were male and 44 (27%) were female. Two subjects were Asian, 12 were Black, 130 were Caucasian, and 20 were categorized as 'other'. Table 1: Adverse Reactions \u2265 5% in Pediatric Patients with Growth Failure Due to GHD Treated with ZOMACTON through 24 Weeks Adverse Reaction 24 Week Exposure to ZOMACTON (n=164) Upper respiratory infection 32% Fever 16% Pharyngitis 12% Headache 11% Otitis Media 10% Increased cough 9% Abdominal pain 7% Anemia 6% Maculopapular rash 6% Diarrhea 5% Pain 5% Rhinitis 5% All pediatric patients were carefully observed for signs or laboratory abnormalities of hypothyroidism. Fifteen patients had T4 values which occasionally fell below the central laboratory's lower limit of normal; T4 levels rose to normal when tested during the next visit for all patients except one who continued to be monitored. Six of the 15 patients received thyroxine therapy before and throughout the study period, and thyroxine dose adjustments were made during the study in 3/6 subjects. In studies with GH deficient pediatric patients, injection site pain was reported in 1.6% of patients. A mild and transient edema, which appeared in 1.6% of patients, was observed early during the course of treatment. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome In a randomized, concurrent-controlled, open-label study, there was an increase in the occurrence of otitis media, ear disorders and surgical procedures in patients receiving another somatropin product at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/week, compared with untreated control patients (Table 2). A similar increase in otitis media was observed in an 18-month placebo-controlled study. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in Patients with Turner Syndrome Treated with 0.3 mg/kg/week of Another Somatropin product During a 4.7 Year Randomized Open-Label Study Untreated (n=62) Somatropin (n=74) Surgical procedure 27% 45% Otitis media 26% 43% Ear disorders 5% 18% Idiopathic Short Stature Adverse reactions from a randomized, placebo-controlled study of another somatropin product dosed at 0.22 mg/kg/week are presented in Table 3. Mean fasting serum insulin concentration increased 10% in the group treated with another somatropin product at the end of treatment relative to baseline, but remained within the normal reference range.

Short Stature or Growth Failure in SHOX Deficiency Adverse reactions from a 2-year open-label study with another somatropin product compared to no treatment are presented in Table 4. During the study, the proportion of patients who had at least one IGF-1 concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age- and gender-appropriate mean was 37.0% for the somatropin-treated group vs. 0% patients for the untreated group. The proportion of patients who had at least one IGFBP-3 concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age and gender appropriate mean was 59% for the somatropin treated group vs. 29% for the untreated group.

Adverse reactions included common childhood infectious diseases, otitis media, headaches, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n=1). Six patients (4 in the FHD group and 2 in the IAD group whose dose was increased from 0.035 mg/kg/day to 0.067 mg/kg/day [one at Month 3 and one at Year 1])) had impaired fasting glucose at Year 2. Two of 6 had impaired fasting glucose during the study, and 1 discontinued treatment at month 15 as a consequence. At study completion, 20-25% of patients had serum IGF-1 SDS values > +2. The following adverse reactions were reported from an observational study of 340 pediatric patients who received another somatropin product with an average dosage of 0.041 mg/kg/day for an average of 3 years: type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=1), carpal tunnel syndrome (n=1) and exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis (n=1). Adult Patients Adult-Onset GH Deficiency In the first 6 months of controlled blinded trials during which patients received either another somatropin product or placebo, patients who received this other somatropin product experienced a statistically significant increase in edema (another somatropin product 17% vs. placebo 4%, p=0.043) and peripheral edema (12% vs. 0%, respectively, p=0.017). Edema, muscle pain, joint pain, and joint disorder were reported early in therapy and tended to be transient or responsive to dosage titration. Two of 113 patients developed carpal tunnel syndrome after beginning maintenance therapy without a low dose (0.00625 mg/kg/day) lead-in phase. Symptoms abated in these patients after dosage reduction. All adverse reactions with \u22655% overall occurrence rate during 12 or 18 months of replacement therapy with another somatropin product are shown in Table 5 (adult-onset patients) and in Table 6 (childhood-onset patients). Adult patients treated with another somatropin product who had been diagnosed with GH deficiency in childhood reported adverse reactions less frequently than those with adult-onset GH deficiency.

Patients were randomized to receive either placebo injections or another somatropin product (0.00625 mg/kg/day for the first 4 weeks, then 0.0125 mg/kg/day thereafter) for the first 6 months, followed by open-label use of another somatropin product for the next 12 months for all patients. The patients in these studies reported side effects less frequently than those with adult-onset GH deficiency. During the placebo-controlled phase (first 6 months) of the study, elevations of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transferase were reported significantly more often for somatropin-treated (12.5%) than placebo-treated patients (0.0%, p=0.031). No other events were reported significantly more often for somatropin-treated patients during the placebo-controlled phase.

Because the following adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders \u2014 Pancreatitis Immune system disorders \u2014 Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema Metabolism and nutrition disorders \u2014 New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \u2013 osteonecrosis in pediatric patients Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified \u2014 Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient pediatric patients treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH), and GH of pituitary origin Nervous system disorders \u2014 Headaches (common in pediatric patients and occasional in adults) Reproductive system and breast disorders \u2014 Gynecomastia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \u2014 Increase in size or number of cutaneous nevi"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 7 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with ZOMACTON and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 7: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with ZOMACTON Glucocorticoids Clinical Impact: Microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. ZOMACTON inhibits 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of ZOMACTON may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Intervention: Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of ZOMACTON [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Examples: Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Clinical Impact: Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of ZOMACTON in pediatric patients. Intervention: Carefully adjust glucocorticoid replacement dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Clinical Impact: Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. ZOMACTON may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Intervention: Careful monitoring is advisable when ZOMACTON is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Oral Estrogen Clinical Impact: Oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to ZOMACTON. Intervention: Patients receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater ZOMACTON dosages [seeDosage and Administration (2.2)] . Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents Clinical Impact: Treatment with ZOMACTON may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Intervention: Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Glucocorticoids: Patients treated with glucocorticoid for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of ZOMACTON ( 7 ) Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment: Adjust glucocorticoid replacement dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. ( 7 ) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: ZOMACTON may alter the clearance. Monitor carefully if used with ZOMACTON ( 7 ) Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of ZOMACTON may be required ( 7 ) Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents: Dose adjustment of insulin or hypoglycemic agent may be required ( 5.4 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy and Lactation : If ZOMACTON 5 mg is needed, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or use the ZOMACTON 10 mg benzyl alcohol-free formulation. ( 8.1 , 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The ZOMACTON 5 mg diluent contains benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Therefore, if ZOMACTON 5mg is needed during pregnancy, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, use only one dose per vial, and discard the unused portion, or use a ZOMACTON 10 mg benzyl alcohol-free formulation. Limited published data do not report an association with somatropin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when somatropin is used in pregnancy. Published reports indicate that somatropin does not cross the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ZOMACTON. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The ZOMACTON 5mg diluent contains benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. If ZOMACTON 5mg is needed during lactation, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, use only one dose per vial, and discard after use or use a ZOMACTON 10 mg benzyl alcohol-free formulation . There is no information regarding the presence of somatropin in human milk. Limited published data indicate that exogenous somatropin does not increase normal breastmilk concentrations of growth hormone. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant have been reported with somatropin. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ZOMACTON and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZOMACTON or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ZOMACTON in pediatric patients have been established in growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone, short stature associated with Turner syndrome, idiopathic short stature (ISS), short stature or growth failure in SHOX deficiency, and short stature in children born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of age. Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone Safety and effectiveness of ZOMACTON have been established in pediatric patients with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency based on data from a multi-center, open-label study in 164 pediatric patients conducted for a two-year period [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Short Stature associated with Turner Syndrome Safety and effectiveness of ZOMACTON have been established in pediatric patients with short stature associated with Turner syndrome based on data from one long-term, randomized, open-label, Canadian multicenter, concurrently controlled study; two long-term, open-label multicenter, historically controlled US studies; and one long-term, randomized, US dose-response study with another somatropin product in 181 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) Safety and effectiveness of ZOMACTON have been established in pediatric patients with ISS based on data from two randomized, multicenter studies, one placebo-controlled study and one dose-response study with another somatropin product in 310 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Short Stature or Growth Failure in SHOX Deficiency Safety and effectiveness of ZOMACTON have been established in pediatric patients with short stature or growth failure in SHOX deficiency based on data from a randomized, controlled, two-year, three-arm, open-label study with another somatropin product in 52 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Short Stature in Children Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2 Years to 4 Years of Age Safety and effectiveness of ZOMACTON have been established in pediatric patients with short stature born SGA with no catch-up growth based on data from two clinical studies with another somatropin product in 228 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Toxicity (Gasping Syndrome) with Benzyl Alcohol-Preserved Solution Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \"gasping syndrome\" occurred in premature neonates and infants in the intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 mg/kg/day to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 mmol/L to 1.378 mmol/L). The maximal daily uptake of benzyl alcohol is 39 mg at ZOMACTON doses of 0.067 mg/kg/day. Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. When administering ZOMACTON 5 mg to infants, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, not with the diluent provided. Use only one dose per vial and discard the unused portion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of somatropin in patients aged 65 years and over has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to development of adverse reactions. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for geriatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin binds to dimeric GH receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells. This interaction results in intracellular signal transduction and subsequent induction of transcription and translation of GH-dependent proteins including IGF-1, IGF BP-3 and acid-labile subunit. Somatropin has direct tissue and metabolic effects or effects mediated indirectly by IGF-1, including stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation, and proliferation, stimulation of hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis, and lipolysis. Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the growth plates (epiphyses) of long bones. The stimulation of skeletal growth increases linear growth rate (height velocity) in most somatropin-treated pediatric patients. Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 4 mg ZOMACTON in healthy subjects (n=54) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone results in an increased mean (SD) IGF-1 level from 233 (95) ng/mL predose to maximal level of 414 (120) ng/mL after approx. 24 hours. After 96 hours, the subjects displayed a mean (SD) IGF-1 concentration of 228 (74) ng/mL, comparable to the predose value. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption \u2014 Somatropin has been studied following subcutaneous, and intravenous administration in adult healthy subjects. A single subcutaneous dose of 4 mg ZOMACTON in healthy subjects (n=54) with suppressed endogenous growth hormone resulted in a mean (SD) Cmax of 38.1 (19.3) ng/mL after approximately 4.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of somatropin is approximately 70% after subcutaneous administration. Distribution \u2014 The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution of somatropin after single dose subcutaneous administration of 4 mg ZOMACTON in healthy subjects is 53.3 (24.6) L. Elimination Metabolism \u2014 Extensive metabolism studies have not been conducted. The metabolic fate of somatropin involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. Excretion - In healthy subjects, mean somatropin clearance is 0.133 L/min following intravenous administration. The mean elimination half-life of intravenous somatropin is 0.42 hours, whereas subcutaneously administered somatropin has a mean half-life of 2.3 hours. The longer half-life observed after subcutaneous administration is due to slow absorption from the injection site. Urinary excretion of intact somatropin has not been measured. Specific Populations Geriatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of somatropin have not been studied in patients greater than 65 years of age. Pediatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of somatropin in pediatric patients are similar to those of adults. Male and Female Patients \u2014 No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with somatropin. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment \u2014 No studies have been performed with somatropin. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ZOMACTON or other somatropins. In a clinical trial with another recombinant growth hormone during the first 6 months of somatropin therapy in 314 naive patients, 1.6% developed specific antibodies to somatropin (binding capacity \u22650.02 mg/L). None had antibody concentrations which exceeded 2 mg/L. Throughout 8 years of this same study, two patients (0.6%) had binding capacity >2 mg/L. Neither patient demonstrated a decrease in growth velocity at or near the time of increased antibody production. It has been reported that growth attenuation from pituitary-derived GH may occur when antibody concentrations are >1.5 mg/L."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Pediatric Patients with Growth Failure Due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone A 2-year open-label, multi-center study with ZOMACTON was conducted in the United States and in Israel in 164 pediatric patients with short stature due to GHD. The subjects ranged in age from 2.1 to 17.7 years with a mean of 10.8 years. One hundred twenty (73%) of the subjects were male and 44 (27%) were female. Two subjects were Asian, 12 were Black, 130 were Caucasian, and 20 were categorized as 'other'. The primary efficacy of the product was assessed by calculating height velocity. Mean cumulative increases in height velocity from baseline of 6.6, 4.6, and 6.3 cm/year were attained by 24 weeks of treatment (p < 0.01) in Na\u00efve Type I (serum GH < 10 ng/mL in response to at least two provocative pharmacological tests), Na\u00efve Type II (integrated GH level < 3.5 ng/mL with or without at least one serum GH \u2265 10 ng/mL), and Non-Na\u00efve (treated with GH up to study Day 1, or previously treated and discontinued GH treatment at least 6 months prior to study Day 1) subjects, respectively. After 12 months of treatment, the mean cumulative increases in height velocity from baseline were 5.7, 4.4 and 5.3 cm/year (p= 0.01) in Na\u00efve Type I, Na\u00efve Type II, and Non-Na\u00efve subjects, respectively. 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome One long-term, randomized, open-label, Canadian multicenter, concurrently controlled study; two long-term, open-label multicenter, historically controlled US studies; and one long-term, randomized, US dose-response study were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of another somatropin product for treatment of short stature due to Turner syndrome. The Canadian randomized study compared near-adult height outcomes for patients treated with another somatropin product to those of a concurrent control group who received no injections. Patients received a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/week given in divided doses 6 times per week from a mean age of 12 years for a mean duration of 5 years. Puberty was induced with a standardized estrogen regimen initiated at 13 years of age for both treatment groups. In two of the US studies, the effect of long-term treatment with another somatropin product (0.375 mg/kg/week given in divided doses either 3 times per week or daily) on adult height was determined by comparing adult heights in the treated patients with those of age-matched historical controls with Turner syndrome who received no growth-promoting therapy. Puberty was induced with a standardized estrogen regimen initiated after 14 years of age in one study; in the second study patients treated early (before 11 years of age) were randomized to begin pubertal induction at either age 12 (n=26) or 15 (n=29) years (conjugated estrogens, 0.3 mg escalating to 0.625 mg daily); those whose treatment was initiated after 11 years of age began estrogen replacement after 1 year of treatment with another somatropin product. In a dose-response study in the US, patients were treated from a mean age of 11 years for a mean duration of 5 years with a weekly dosage of either 0.27 mg/kg or 0.36 mg/kg of another somatropin product administered in divided doses 3 or 6 times weekly. In summary, patients with Turner syndrome (total n=181 from the 4 studies above) treated to adult height achieved statistically significant average height gains ranging from 5.0 to 8.3 cm (see Table 8).

The diagnosis of idiopathic short stature was made after excluding other known causes of short stature, as well as GH deficiency. The placebo-controlled study enrolled 71 pediatric patients (55 males, 16 females) 9 to 15 years old (mean age 12 \u00b1 1.5 years), with short stature, 68 of whom received another somatropin product. Patients were predominately prepubertal (Tanner I, 45%) or in early puberty (Tanner II, 47%) at baseline. In this double-blind study, patients received subcutaneous injections of either another somatropin product 0.222 mg/kg/week, or placebo given in divided doses 3 times per week until height velocity decreased to \u22641.5 cm/year (\"final height\"). Final height measurements were available for 33 subjects (22 treated, 11 placebo) after a mean treatment duration of 4.4 years (range 0.1-9.1 years). Results are presented in Table 9. The number of patients whose final height was above the 5th percentile of the general population height standard for age and sex was significantly greater in the treated group than the placebo group (41% vs. 0%), as was the number of patients who gained at least 1 SDS unit in height across the duration of the study (50% vs. 0%).

Mean \u00b1 SD baseline characteristics included: height SDS -3.21 \u00b1 0.70, predicted adult height SDS -2.63 \u00b1 1.08, and height velocity SDS -1.09 \u00b1 1.15. All but 3 patients were prepubertal. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 0.24 mg/kg/week; 0.24 mg/kg/week for 1 year, followed by 0.37 mg/kg/week; and 0.37 mg/kg/week. Height velocity was assessed by dose during the first 2 years of therapy. After completing the initial 2-year dose-response phase of the study, 50 patients were followed to final height. Patients who received the dosage of 0.37 mg/kg/week had a significantly greater increase in mean height velocity after 2 years of treatment than patients who received 0.24 mg/kg/week (4.04 vs. 3.27 cm/year, p=0.003). The results are presented in Table 10. While no patient had height above the 5th percentile in any dosage group at baseline, 82% of the patients who received 0.37 mg/kg/week and 47% of the patients who received 0.24 mg/kg/week achieved final heights above the 5th percentile of the general population height standards (p=NS).

A total of 52 patients (24 male, 28 female) with SHOX deficiency, 3 to 12 years of age, were randomized to either a treated arm (27 patients; mean age 7 \u00b1 2 years) or an untreated control arm (25 patients; mean age 8 \u00b1 3 years). To determine the comparability of treatment effect between patients with SHOX deficiency and patients with Turner syndrome, the third study arm enrolled 26 patients with Turner syndrome, 5 to 12 years of age (mean age 8 \u00b1 2 years), to treatment. All patients were prepubertal at study entry. Patients in the treated group(s) received daily subcutaneous injections of 0.05 mg/kg of another somatropin product, equivalent to 0.35 mg/kg/week. Patients in the untreated group received no injections. The results are presented in Table 11.

Study entry criteria included birth weight <10th percentile and/or birth length SDS <-2 for gestational age, and height SDS for chronological age \u2264-3. Exclusion criteria included syndromal conditions (e.g., Turner syndrome), chronic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus), and tumor activity. The primary objective was to demonstrate that the increase from baseline in height SDS after 1 year of treatment with another somatropin product would be similar when treatment is administered according to an individually adjusted dose (IAD) regimen or a fixed high dose (FHD) regimen. The height increases would be considered similar if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference between the groups (IAD \u2013 FHD) was greater than -0.5 height SDS. Pediatric patients were randomized to either a FHD (0.067 mg/kg/day; n=99) or an IAD treatment group (n=94). The initial dosage in the IAD treatment group was 0.035 mg/kg/day. The dosage was increased to 0.067 mg/kg/day in those patients in the IAD group whose 1-year height gain predicted at Month 3 was <0.75 height SDS (n=40) or whose actual height gain measured at Year 1 was <0.75 height SDS (n=11). Approximately 85% of the randomized patients completed 2 years of therapy. The results are presented in Table 12. The results were similar when children who entered puberty during the study were removed from the analysis.

Mean chronological age at baseline was 9 \u00b1 0.9 years (range: 7 to 11). Additional study entry criteria included birth length SDS <-2 or <3rd percentile for gestational age, and height SDS for chronological age <-2. Exclusion criteria included syndromal conditions (e.g., Turner syndrome), chronic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus), and any active disease. All 35 patients completed the study. Mean height SDS increased from a baseline value of -2.7 (SD 0.5) to -1.5 (SD 0.6) after 2 years of treatment. 14.6 Adult Patients with Growth Hormone Deficiency Two studies in patients with adult-onset GH deficiency (total n=98) and two studies in adult patients with childhood-onset GH deficiency (total n=67) were designed to assess the effects of replacement therapy with another somatropin product. Adult-onset patients and childhood-onset patients differed by diagnosis (organic vs. idiopathic pituitary disease), body size (average vs. small [mean height and weight]), and age (mean 44 vs. 29 years). These four studies each included a 6-month randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled phase, during which approximately half of the patients received placebo injections, while the other half received injections with another somatropin product. The 6-month, double-blind phase was followed by 12 months of open-label somatropin treatment for all patients. The dosages of this other somatropin product for all studies were identical: 1 month of treatment at 0.00625 mg/kg/day followed by 0.0125 mg/kg/day for the next 5 months. The primary efficacy measures were body composition (lean body mass and fat mass) and lipid parameters. Lean body mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), validated with potassium 40. Body fat was assessed by BIA and sum of skinfold thickness. Lipid subfractions were analyzed by standard assay methods in a central laboratory. In patients with adult-onset GH deficiency, treatment with another somatropin product (vs. placebo) resulted in an increase in mean lean body mass (2.59 vs. -0.22 kg, p<0.001) and a decrease in body fat (-3.27 vs. 0.56 kg, p<0.001). Similar changes were seen in childhood-onset GH deficient patients. Changes in lean body mass persisted throughout the 18-month period for both the adult-onset and childhood-onset groups; the changes in fat mass persisted in the childhood-onset group. Serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol which were low at baseline (mean, 30.1 mg/mL and 33.9 mg/mL in adult-onset and childhood-onset patients, respectively) had normalized by the end of 18 months of treatment with this other somatropin product (mean change of 13.7 mg/dL and 11.1 mg/dL for the adult-onset and childhood-onset groups, respectively p<0.001)."

      "Instructions for Use ZOMACTON \u00ae (zoh-MACK-ton) [somatropin] for Injection Read the Instructions for Use that come with your ZOMACTON \u00ae before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Before you use ZOMACTON for the first time, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it. Supplies needed for your ZOMACTON Injection ZOMACTON 5mg (See Figure A) containing: 1 vial of ZOMACTON 5mg growth hormone in a powder 1 vial of liquid (diluent) containing Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (with 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative) (5mL). This is used to mix your ZOMACTON 5mg. Figure A or ZOMACTON 10mg (See Figure B) containing: 1 vial of ZOMACTON 10mg growth hormone in a powder 1 syringe of liquid (diluent) containing Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (with 0.33% Metacresol as a preservative) (1 mL). This is used to mix your ZOMACTON 10mg. 25 gauge mixing needle Figure B The following additional supplies (See Figure C) will be needed: Syringe and needle for injection. Your healthcare provider will tell you the size of the syringe and needle to use. Alcohol swab Puncture-resistant container (See Step 4: Disposing of used syringes, needles, and vials) Figure C Preparing for Your ZOMACTON Injection Place the supplies you will need on a clean, flat surface in a well-lit area. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Important: The liquids are different for the 5 mg and 10 mg vials. Do not use the 5 mg liquid with the 10 mg ZOMACTON. Do not use the 10 mg liquid with the 5 mg ZOMACTON. Preparing ZOMACTON 5mg Liquid for Injection: Remove the hard plastic cap from the top of the liquid vial by gently pushing up on the edge of the cap (See Figure D) . Do not remove the rubber stopper. Figure D Use an alcohol swab to wipe off the top of the liquid vial (See Figure E) . After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper. Figure E Remove the needle cap from the syringe while making sure you do not touch the needle (See Figure F) . Do not throw away the needle cap. Figure F Hold the barrel of the syringe with 1 hand and pull back on the plunger with the other hand until you have drawn up the amount of air that is the same as the amount of liquid your healthcare provider has prescribed (See Figure G) . Figure G Insert the needle into the liquid vial through the center of the clean rubber stopper. Push down on the plunger until all the air is released into the vial (See Figure H) . Figure H Hold the vial with 1 hand and carefully turn the vial upside down, making sure the syringe needle stays in the vial. The tip of the needle should be below the surface of the liquid. With your other hand, gently pull back the plunger until the amount of liquid your healthcare provider prescribed is in the syringe (See Figure I) . Figure I When the syringe is correctly filled with the liquid, remove the syringe and needle from the vial and recap the needle. Preparing ZOMACTON 10mg Liquid for Injection: Remove the syringe tip cap from the top of the pre-filled liquid syringe and attach the 25G mixing needle that comes with your ZOMACTON (See Figure J) . Figure J Diluting Your ZOMACTON Only use the liquid that comes with the 5 mg ZOMACTON to mix the 5 mg growth hormone. Only use the liquid that comes with the 10 mg ZOMACTON to mix the 10 mg growth hormone. Remove the hard plastic cap of the growth hormone vial (See Figure K) . Figure K Clean the top of the growth hormone vial with an alcohol swab (See Figure L) . Figure L Remove the needle cap from the syringe filled with liquid and insert the needle into the center of the rubber stopper on the growth hormone vial (See Figure M) . Figure M Point the needle toward the side of the vial and slowly push the plunger so that the liquid squirts onto the side of the vial and not directly onto the powder. When all the liquid is in the growth hormone vial, remove the needle from the vial (See Figure N) . Figure N Recap the needle and throw away the syringe. Mixing ZOMACTON Hold the vial between your hands and gently roll it until the mixture is clear. Do not shake the vial. Your ZOMACTON is ready for injection. Sometimes the vial may need to sit a few seconds before the mixture becomes clear. Do not use the mixture in the vial if it remains cloudy or you see particles floating in the mixture. If air bubbles appear, let the growth hormone sit for a while until they disappear. Write the date you mixed the growth hormone on the vial label. The 5 mg vial must be used within 14 days. The 10 mg vial must be used within 28 days. Store your mixed growth hormone and all unopened vials of growth hormone in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Step 1: Preparing the Injection You are now ready for your ZOMACTON injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Check that the vial of growth hormone you are using is clear and that the date of mixing is within 14 days if you are using ZOMACTON 5 mg or 28 days if you are using ZOMACTON 10 mg. Clean the top of the growth hormone vial with an alcohol swab . Do not touch the rubber stopper after cleaning (See Figure O) . Figure O Remove the needle cap from the syringe and insert the needle into the center of the rubber stopper on the growth hormone vial (See Figure P) . Figure P Gently pull back the plunger until the amount of growth hormone solution your healthcare provider has prescribed is in the syringe (See Figure Q) . Figure Q Remove the needle from the vial when the syringe is correctly filled with the solution (See Figure R) . Recap the needle. Figure R Step 2: Choosing an Injection Site There are different sites you can use for your injections. These sites should be rotated (See Figure S). Figure S If you notice any of the following signs, contact your healthcare provider: A lump, bruise or redness at the injection site that does not go away. Any sign of infection at the injection site (pus, redness, heat or persistent pain). Severe, sharp pain or ache at injection site that does not go away. Rash at the injection site. Step 3: Injecting ZOMACTON Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, starting at the injection site and moving outward about 2 inches. Let the skin air dry. Check that the correct dose is in the syringe. Remove the needle cap. Hold the syringe like a pencil in 1 hand . With your free hand, pinch the skin around the site with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand (See Figure T) . Quickly insert the needle into the skin at a 45\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 angle with a quick, dart-like motion. Figure T Holding the syringe in place, pull back a little on the plunger and check to see if any blood flows into the syringe (See Figure U) . If you see blood in the syringe , it means that you have entered a blood vessel. Do not inject ZOMACTON. Withdraw the needle. Throw away the syringe and needle in a puncture-resistant container. Do not use the same syringe or any of the other supplies that you used for this injection. Repeat the steps to prepare a new syringe for injection. Choose and clean a new injection site. Figure U If no blood appears in the syringe, slowly push down plunger all the way until the syringe is completely empty (See Figure V ). Figure V Quickly remove the needle from the skin and apply pressure to the injection site with a dry sterile gauze pad or cotton ball. A drop of blood may appear. Apply a small bandage if needed. Throw away the needle and syringe in your puncture-resistant disposal container. Do not share your syringes, needles, or vials with anyone else. You may give them or get an infection from them. Step 4: Disposing of used syringes, needles, and vials To prevent needle-stick injury and spread of infection, do not try to re-cap the needle. Place used needles, syringes, and vials in a closeable, puncture-resistant container. You may use a sharps container (such as a red biohazard container), hard plastic container (such as a detergent bottle), or metal container (such as an empty coffee can). Do not use glass or clear plastic containers. Ask your healthcare provider for instructions on the right way to throw away (dispose of) the container. There may be state and local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal Do not throw used needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash or recycle. Keep the disposal container, needles, syringes, and vials of ZOMACTON out of reach of children. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE HUMATROPE is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for: Pediatric Patients: growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH); short stature associated with Turner syndrome; Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS), height standard deviation score (SDS) <-2.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range; short stature or growth failure in short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency; short stature born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of age. ( 1.1 ) Adult Patients: replacement of endogenous GH in adults with GH deficiency. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Pediatric Patients HUMATROPE is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with: growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH), short stature associated with Turner syndrome, Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS), height standard deviation score (SDS) <-2.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range, short stature or growth failure in short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, short stature born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of age. 1.2 Adult Patients HUMATROPE is indicated for the replacement of endogenous GH in adults with GH deficiency."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer by subcutaneous injection to the back of upper arm, abdomen, buttock, or thigh with regular rotation of injection sites. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Dosage - divide the calculated weekly dosage into equal doses given either 6, or 7 days per week. GHD: 0.18 mg/kg/week to 0.3 mg/kg/week. ( 2.2 ) Turner Syndrome: Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week. ( 2.2 ) ISS: Up to 0.37 mg/kg/week. ( 2.2 ) SHOX Deficiency: 0.35 mg/kg/week. ( 2.2 ) SGA: Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week. ( 2.2 ) Adult Dosage - Either of the following two dosing regimens may be used: Non-weight based dosing: Initiate with a dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range: 0.15 mg/day-0.3 mg/day) and increase the dose every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 mg/day-0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements ( 2.3 ) Weight-based dosing (Not recommended for obese patients): Initiate at 0.006 mg/kg daily and increase the dose according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.0125 mg/kg daily ( 2.3 ) See Full Prescribing Information for reconstitution instructions. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Administration and Use Instructions Therapy with HUMATROPE should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with the conditions for which HUMATROPE is indicated [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with HUMATROPE to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Leave HUMATROPE at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to administration. Administer HUMATROPE by subcutaneous injection to the back of the upper arm, abdomen, buttock, or thigh with regular rotation of injection sites to avoid lipoatrophy. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage Individualize dosage for each patient based on the growth response. Divide the calculated weekly HUMATROPE dosage into equal doses given either 6 or 7 days per week. The recommended weekly dose in milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight for pediatric patients is: Pediatric GH Deficiency: 0.18 mg/kg/week to 0.3 mg/kg/week (0.026 to 0.043 mg/kg/day) Turner Syndrome: Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week (up to.054 mg/kg/day) Idiopathic Short Stature: Up to 0.37 mg/kg/week (up to 0.053 mg/kg/day) SHOX Deficiency: 0.35 mg/kg/week (0.05 mg/kg/day) Small for Gestational Age (SGA): Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day) In very short pediatric patients, height SDS less than -3, and older pubertal pediatric patients consider initiating treatment with a larger dose of HUMATROPE (up to 0.067 mg/kg/day). Consider a gradual reduction in dosage if substantial catch-up growth is observed during the first few years of therapy. In pediatric patients less than 4 years of age with less severe short stature, baseline height SDS values between -2 and -3, consider initiating treatment at 0.033 mg/kg/day and titrate the dose as needed. Assess compliance and evaluate other causes of poor growth such as hypothyroidism, under-nutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human GH if patients experience failure to increase height velocity, particularly during the first year of treatment. Discontinue HUMATROPE for stimulation of linear growth once epiphyseal fusion has occurred [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 2.3 Adult Dosage Patients who were treated with somatropin for GH deficiency in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin for GH deficient adults. Consider using a lower starting dose and smaller dose increment increases for geriatric patients as they may be at increased risk for adverse reactions with HUMATROPE than younger individuals [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Women may require higher doses and patients receiving oral estrogen may require higher doses [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Administer the prescribed dose daily. Either of two HUMATROPE dosing regimens may be used: Non-weight based: Initiate HUMATROPE with a dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15 mg/day to 0.3 mg/day) and increase the dose every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 mg/day to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations. Use the patient's clinical response, adverse reactions, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-1 concentrations as guidance in dose titration. Maintenance dosages will vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients. Weight-based: Initiate HUMATROPE at 0.006 mg/kg daily and increase the dose according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.0125 mg/kg daily. Use the patient's clinical response, adverse reactions, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-1 concentrations as guidance in dose titration. Maintenance dosages will vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients Not recommended for obese patients as they are more likely to experience adverse reactions with this regimen. 2.4 Reconstitution of Cartridges Each single-patient-use HUMATROPE cartridge is designed for use only with the appropriate corresponding HumatroPen \u00ae supplied separately. Reconstitute each cartridge of HUMATROPE using only the diluent syringe that accompanies the cartridge. Do not shake. The reconstituted solution should be clear. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration. If the resulting solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter do not use. The somatropin concentrations for the reconstituted HUMATROPE cartridges are as follows in Table 1 : Table 1: Somatropin Concentration of HUMATROPE Cartridges. Cartridge Somatropin Concentration 6 mg 2.08 mg/mL 12 mg 4.17 mg/mL 24 mg 8.33 mg/mL Reconstituted cartridges of HUMATROPE are stable for up to 28 days when refrigerated at 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Neoplasm: Second neoplasms have occurred in childhood cancer survivors. Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. ( 5.3 ) Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: HUMATROPE may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving HUMATROPE, especially in patients with existing diabetes mellitus or at risk for development. ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension (IH): Has been reported usually within 8 weeks of initiation. Perform fundoscopic examinations prior to initiation and periodically thereafter. If papilledema occurs, stop treatment. ( 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention. ( 5.6 ) Fluid Retention: May occur in adults and may be dose dependent. ( 5.7 ) Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism. ( 5.8 ) Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as hypothyroidism may occur or worsen after initiation of somatropin. ( 5.9 ) Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients: May occur; evaluate patients with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain. ( 5.10 ) Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients: Monitor patients with scoliosis for progression. ( 5.11 ) Pancreatitis: Has been reported; consider pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain, especially pediatric patients. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic doses of somatropin [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Two placebo-controlled clinical studies in non-GH deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3-8.0 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing HUMATROPE treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. HUMATROPE is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults. 5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of, or increased, snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . HUMATROPE is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.3 Increased Risk of Neoplasms Active Malignancy There is an increased risk of malignancy progression with somatropin treatment in patients with active malignancy [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with HUMATROPE. Discontinue HUMATROPE if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Risk of Second Neoplasm in Pediatric Patients An increased risk of a second neoplasm in pediatric cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head and who developed subsequent GH deficiency and were treated with somatropin has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence. Monitor all patients receiving HUMATROPE who have a history of GH deficiency secondary to an intracranial neoplasm for progression or recurrence of the tumor. New Malignancy During Treatment Because pediatric patients with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting HUMATROPE in these patients. If HUMATROPE is initiated, carefully monitor patients for development of neoplasms. Monitor all patients receiving HUMATROPE carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. Advise patients/caregivers to report marked changes in behavior, onset of headaches, vision disturbances and/or changes in skin pigmentation or changes in the appearance of pre-existing nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. New onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving HUMATROPE, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely. The doses of antidiabetic agents may require adjustment when HUMATROPE is initiated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropins. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with HUMATROPE to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with HUMATROPE can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs. Do not use HUMATROPE in patients with known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of the excipients in HUMATROPE. Do not use HUMATROPE cartridges in patients with known hypersensitivity to metacresol or glycerin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesia) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of HUMATROPE treatment. Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to HUMATROPE, in particular, the growth response in pediatric patients. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests performed, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients undergoing rapid growth. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin. Evaluate pediatric patients receiving HUMATROPE with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain for slipped capital femoral epiphysis and osteonecrosis and manage accordingly. 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Somatropin increases the growth rate, and progression of existing scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for progression of scoliosis. 5.12 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in pediatric patients and adults receiving somatropins. The risk may be greater risk in pediatric patients compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other pediatric patients receiving somatropins. Pancreatitis should be considered in patients who develop abdominal pain. 5.13 Lipoatrophy When somatropins are administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering HUMATROPE to reduce this risk [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and IGF-I may increase after HUMATROPE therapy."

Pediatric Patients Growth Failure Due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone In an uncontrolled open-label study, 314 treatment-naive children aged >2 years who had GH deficiency were treated with HUMATROPE (0.06 mg/kg 3 times per week) for up to 8 years. Adverse reactions of special interest are reported in Table 2 . Table 2: Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Occurring in Humatrope-Treated Patients with Growth Failure Due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone in an Open-label Study for Up to 8 Years a Dose=0.06 mg/kg 3 times per week for up to 8 years. b n=1 Adverse Reaction HUMATROPE a (n=314) Hypothyroidism 25% Allergic reaction 11% Arthralgia 6% Bone disorder 4% Edema 4% Injection site pain/reaction 4% Neoplasm/tumor 2% Cardiovascular disorders 1% Thyroid disorders 1% Intracranial hypertension 0% b Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome In a randomized, concurrent-controlled (untreated), open-label study until attainment of adult height, the adverse reactions of special interest occurring in 74 patients treated with Humatrope at dose 0.3 mg/kg/week (mean duration 4.1 years) and in 62 untreated patients (mean duration 3.7 years) are reported in Table 3 . A similar increase in otitis media was observed in an 18-month placebo-controlled study.

One patient developed glucose intolerance and high serum HbA 1c . Short Stature or Growth Failure in SHOX Deficiency Adverse reactions of special interest from a 2-year randomized, open-label study with HUMATROPE (0.35 mg/kg/wk) compared to no treatment are presented in Table 5 . During the 2-year study period, the proportion of patients who had at least one IGF-I concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age- and gender-appropriate mean was 10 of 27 (37%) for the HUMATROPE-treated group vs. 0 of 24 patients (0%) for the untreated group. The proportion of patients who had at least one IGFBP-3 concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age and gender appropriate mean was 16 of 27 (59%) for the HUMATROPE treated group vs. 7 of 24 (29%) for the untreated group.

Reported adverse reactions included: common childhood infectious diseases, otitis media, headaches, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n=1. Six patients (4 in the FHD group and 2 in the IAD group whose dose was increased from 0.035 mg/kg/day to 0.067 mg/kg/day [one at Month 3 and one at Year 1]) had impaired fasting glucose at Year 2. Two of 6 had impaired fasting glucose during the study, and one discontinued HUMATROPE at month 15 as a consequence. At study completion, 20-25% of patients had serum IGF-I SDS values > +2. The following adverse reactions were reported from an observational study of 340 pediatric patients who received HUMATROPE with an average dosage of 0.041 mg/kg/day (maximum dose: 0.084 mg/kg/day) for an average of 3.0 years: type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=1), carpal tunnel syndrome (n=1) and an exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis (n=1). Adult Patients with GH deficiency Adult-Onset GH Deficiency In the first 6 months of controlled blinded studies during which patients received either HUMATROPE or placebo, patients who received HUMATROPE experienced an increase in edema (17% vs. 4%) and peripheral edema (12% vs. 0%). Edema, muscle pain, joint pain, and joint disorder were reported early in therapy and tended to be transient or responsive to dosage titration. Two of 113 patients developed carpal tunnel syndrome after beginning maintenance therapy without a low dose (0.00625 mg/kg/day) lead-in phase. Symptoms abated in these patients after dosage reduction. Adverse reactions with \u22655% overall occurrence rate during 12 or 18 months of replacement therapy with HUMATROPE are shown in Table 6 (adult-onset patients) and in Table 7 (childhood-onset patients).

Patients were randomized to receive either placebo injections or HUMATROPE (0.00625 mg/kg/day for the first 4 weeks, then 0.0125 mg/kg/day thereafter) for the first 6 months, followed by open-label use of HUMATROPE for the next 12 months for all patients. During the placebo-controlled phase (first 6 months) of the study, elevations of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transferase were reported more for HUMATROPE-treated (13% vs. 0%) than placebo-treated patients.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 8 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with HUMATROPE and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 8: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with HUMATROPE Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment Clinical Impact: Microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. HUMATROPE inhibits 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of HUMATROPE may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Intervention: Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of HUMATROPE [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Examples: Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be effected more than others since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. Non-Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment in Pediatric Patients Clinical Impact: Non-replacement glucocorticoid treatment, including supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment, may attenuate the growth promoting effects of HUMATROPE in pediatric patients. Intervention: Carefully adjust glucocorticoid dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Clinical Impact: Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. HUMATROPE may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Intervention: Careful monitoring is advisable when HUMATROPE is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Oral Estrogen Clinical Impact: Oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to HUMATROPE. Intervention: Patients receiving oral estrogen may require greater HUMATROPE dosages [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents Clinical Impact: Treatment with HUMATROPE may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Intervention: Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment: Patients treated with glucocorticoids for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of HUMATROPE. ( 7 ) Non-Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment in Pediatric Patients: Adjust glucocorticoid dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. ( 7 ) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: HUMATROPE may alter the clearance. Monitor carefully if used with HUMATROPE. ( 7 ) Oral Estrogen: Patients may require larger doses of HUMATROPE. ( 7 ) Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents: Dose adjustment of insulin or hypoglycemic agent may be required. ( 5.4 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with somatropin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with HUMATROPE. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of somatropin in human milk. Limited published data indicate that exogenous somatropin does not increase normal breastmilk concentrations of growth hormone. No adverse effects related to somatropin in the breastfed infant have been reported. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HUMATROPE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HUMATROPE or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE in pediatric patients have been established in growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone, short stature associated with Turner syndrome, idiopathic short stature (ISS), short stature or growth failure in SHOX deficiency, and short stature in children born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of age. Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone Safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE have been established in pediatric patients with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency based on data from an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study with HUMATROPE in 314 pediatric patients conducted for up to 8 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome Safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE have been established in pediatric patients with short stature associated with Turner syndrome based on data from one long-term, randomized, open-label, multicenter, concurrently controlled study; two long-term, open-label multicenter, historically controlled US studies; and one long-term, randomized, US dose-response study with HUMATROPE in 181 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) Safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE have been established in pediatric patients with ISS based on data from two randomized, multicenter studies, one placebo-controlled study and one dose-response study with HUMATROPE in 310 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Short Stature or Growth Failure in SHOX Deficiency Safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE have been established in pediatric patients with short stature or growth failure in SHOX deficiency based on data from a randomized, controlled, two-year, three-arm, open-label study with HUMATROPE in 52 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . Short Stature in Children Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by 2 Years to 4 Years of Age Safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE have been established in pediatric patients with short stature born SGA with no catch-up growth based on data from two clinical studies with HUMATROPE in 214 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of HUMATROPE in patients aged 65 years and over has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to development of adverse reactions. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Somatropin is a human growth hormone (GH) produced by recombinant DNA technology using Escherichia coli. The protein is comprised of 191 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of about 22,125 daltons. The amino acid sequence is identical to that of human GH of pituitary origin. HUMATROPE (somatropin) for injection is a sterile, white, lyophilized powder intended for subcutaneous injection after reconstitution supplied in a cartridge. Phosphoric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust the pH. Reconstituted solutions have a pH of approximately 7.5. This product is oxygen sensitive. Cartridge \u2014 Each single-patient-use cartridge of HUMATROPE contains either 6 mg (18 IU), 12 mg (36 IU), or 24 mg (72 IU) of somatropin.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin binds to dimeric GH receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells. This interaction results in intracellular signal transduction and subsequent induction of transcription and translation of GH-dependent proteins including IGF-1, IGF BP-3 and acid-labile subunit. Somatropin has direct tissue and metabolic effects or mediated indirectly by IGF-1, including stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation, and proliferation, stimulation of hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis and lipolysis. Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the growth plates (epiphyses) of long bones. The stimulation of skeletal growth increases linear growth rate (height velocity) in most somatropin-treated pediatric patients. Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of Humatrope (0.033 mg/kg body weight) in healthy volunteers (10 males, 10 females) resulted in an increased median IGF-1 level from 202 ng/mL (men) and 107 ng/mL (women) predose to maximal level of 362 ng/mL (men) and 234 ng/mL (women) after a median of 21 hours (men) and 14 hours (women). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption HUMATROPE has been studied following intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous administration in healthy adult subjects. A single subcutaneous dose administration of HUMATROPE 0.1 mg/kg (0.27 IU/kg) in healthy subjects (n= 8) resulted in a mean (SD) C max of 63.3 (18.2) ng/mL at median T max of 4.0 (range 3 to 8) hours. The absolute bioavailability of somatropin is 75% after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The mean (SD) volume of distribution of somatropin after single dose subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg/kg (0.27 IU/kg) in healthy subjects is about 0.96 (0.3) L/kg. Elimination Metabolism \u2014 Extensive metabolism studies have not been conducted. The metabolic fate of somatropin involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. In renal cells, at least a portion of the breakdown products of somatropin is returned to the systemic circulation. Excretion \u2014 In healthy subjects, mean somatropin clearance is 0.18 (0.03) L/hr/kg following subcutaneous administration. The mean half-life of subcutaneous somatropin is 3.8 (1.4) hours. The long half-life observed after subcutaneous administration is due to slow absorption from the injection site. Urinary excretion of intact HUMATROPE has not been measured. Small amounts of somatropin have been detected in the urine of pediatric patients following replacement therapy. Specific Populations Geriatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of HUMATROPE have not been studied in patients greater than 65 years of age. Pediatric patients \u2014 The pharmacokinetics of HUMATROPE in pediatric patients are similar to those of adults. Male and Female Patients \u2014 No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with HUMATROPE. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women. Patients with Renal or hepatic impairment \u2014 No studies have been performed with HUMATROPE. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of HUMATROPE or other somatropins. In a clinical study with HUMATROPE during the first 6 months of HUMATROPE therapy in 314 naive patients, 1.6% developed specific antibodies to HUMATROPE (binding capacity \u22650.02 mg/L). None had antibody concentrations which exceeded 2 mg/L. Throughout 8 years of this same study, two patients (0.6%) had binding capacity >2 mg/L. Neither patient demonstrated a decrease in growth velocity at or near the time of increased antibody production. It has been reported that growth attenuation from pituitary-derived GH may occur when antibody concentrations are >1.5 mg/L."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Pediatric Patients with Growth Failure Due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone An open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study with Humatrope was conducted in, 314 treatment-naive children aged >2 years who had GH deficiency. Patients were treated with HUMATROPE (0.06 mg/kg 3 times per week) for up to 8 years. The efficacy of HUMTROPE was assessed by evaluating height velocity. Mean increase in height velocity from baseline of 3.6 \u00b1 1.9 cm/year to 8.8 \u00b1 2.3 cm/year was achieved by 1 year of treatment. Height velocity remained increased above baseline for a small subset of patients (n=12) who remained on-study up to 8 years during the long-term extension phase (6.3 \u00b1 2.5 cm/year at year 8 of treatment). 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome One long-term, randomized, open-label, Canadian multicenter, concurrently controlled study, two long-term, open-label multicenter, historically controlled US studies and one long-term, randomized, US dose-response study were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of HUMATROPE for treatment of short stature due to Turner syndrome. The randomized, open-label, Canadian study (NCT00191113) compared near-adult height outcomes for HUMATROPE-treated patients to those of a concurrent control group who received no injections. The HUMATROPE-treated patients received a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/week given in divided doses 6 times per week from a mean age of 11.7 years for a mean duration of 4.7 years. Puberty was induced with a standardized estrogen regimen initiated at 13 years of age for both treatment groups. In two of the US studies the effect of long-term treatment with Humatrope (0.375 mg/kg/week given in divided doses either 3 times per week or daily) on adult height was determined by comparing adult heights in the treated patients with those of age-matched historical controls with Turner syndrome who received no growth-promoting therapy. Puberty was induced with a standardized estrogen regimen initiated after 14 years of age in one study; in the second study patients treated early (before 11 years of age) were randomized to begin pubertal induction at either age 12 (n=26) or 15 (n=29) years (conjugated estrogens, 0.3 mg escalating to 0.625 mg daily); those whose treatment was initiated after 11 years of age began estrogen replacement after 1 year of treatment with HUMATROPE. In the third US study, a randomized, blinded dose-response study, patients were treated from a mean age of 10.9 years for a mean duration of 5.5 years with a weekly HUMATROPE dosage of either 0.27 mg/kg or 0.36 mg/kg administered in divided doses 3 or 6 times weekly. In summary, patients with Turner syndrome (total n=249 from the 4 studies above) treated to adult height achieved average height gains ranging from 5.0 to 8.3 cm. See Table 10 .

The diagnosis of idiopathic short stature was made after excluding other known causes of short stature, as well as GH deficiency. The placebo-controlled study enrolled 71 pediatric patients (55 males, 16 females) 9 to 15 years old (mean age 12.4 \u00b1 1.5 years), with short stature, 68 of whom received placebo (n=31) or HUMATROPE (n=37); NCT00191074. Patients were predominately prepubertal (Tanner I, 45%) or in early puberty (Tanner II, 47%) at baseline. In this double-blind study, patients received subcutaneous injections of either HUMATROPE 0.222 mg/kg/week, or placebo given in divided doses 3 times per week until height velocity decreased to \u22641.5 cm/year (\u201cfinal height\u201d). Final height measurements were available for 33 subjects (22 treated with HUMATROPE, 11 treated with placebo) after a mean treatment duration of 4.4 years (range 0.1-9.1 years). Results are presented in Table 11 . The number of patients whose final height was above the 5th percentile of the general population height standard for age and sex was significantly greater in the HUMATROPE group than the placebo group (41% vs. 0%), as was the number of patients who gained at least 1 SDS unit in height across the duration of the study (50% vs. 0%).

Mean \u00b1 SD baseline characteristics included: height SDS -3.21 \u00b1 0.70, predicted adult height SDS -2.63 \u00b1 1.08, and height velocity SDS -1.09 \u00b1 1.15. All but 3 patients were prepubertal. Patients were randomized to one of three HUMATROPE treatment groups: 0.24 mg/kg/week (n=78); 0.24 mg/kg/week for 1 year, followed by 0.37 mg/kg/week (n=78); and 0.37 mg/kg/week (n=83). Height velocity was assessed in each treatment group during the first 2 years of therapy. After completing the initial 2-year dose-response phase of the study, 50 patients were followed to final height. After 2 years of treatment, patients who received the HUMATROPE dosage of 0.37 mg/kg/week (n=71) had a significantly greater increase in mean height velocity than patients who received 0.24 mg/kg/week (n=68), (4.04 vs. 3.27 cm/year respectively (ANOVA p=0.003). A total of 12 patients who received 0.37 mg/kg/week and 10 patients who received 0.24 mg/kg/week treatment had missing 2 year treatment data. The mean difference between final height and baseline predicted height was 7.2 cm for patients who received Humatrope 0.37 mg/kg/week and 5.4 cm for patients who received 0.24 mg/kg/week. The results are presented in Table 12 . While no patient had height above the 5th percentile in any dosage group at baseline, 82% (n=14) of the 17 patients who received 0.37 mg/kg/week and 47% (n=8) of the 17 patients who received 0.24 mg/kg/week achieved final heights above the 5th percentile of the general population height standards.

A total of 52 patients (24 male, 28 female) with SHOX deficiency, 3 to 12.3 years of age, were randomized to either a HUMATROPE-treated arm (27 patients; mean age 7.3 \u00b1 2.1 years) or an untreated control arm (25 patients; mean age 7.5 \u00b1 2.7 years). To determine the comparability of treatment effect between patients with SHOX deficiency and patients with Turner syndrome, the third study arm enrolled 26 patients with Turner syndrome, 4.5 to 11.8 years of age (mean age 7.5 \u00b1 1.9 years) who received HUMATROPE treatment. All patients were prepubertal at study entry. Patients in the HUMATROPE-treated group(s) received daily subcutaneous injections of 0.05 mg/kg of HUMATROPE, equivalent to 0.35 mg/kg/week. Patients in the untreated group received no injections. One untreated patient discontinued the study during the first year. The results are presented in Table 13 ; the mean first-year height velocity of treated patients with SHOX deficiency was significantly greater than that of the untreated patients (mean between-group difference = 3.5 [95% CI: 2.8 \u2013 4.2] cm/year, p<0.001).

A 2-year, open-label, multicenter, European study enrolled 193 prepubertal, non-GH deficient children with mean chronological age 6.8 \u00b1 2.4 years (range: 3 to 12.3); NCT00191529. Study entry criteria included birth weight <10th percentile and/or birth length SDS <-2 for gestational age, and height SDS for chronological age \u2264-3. Exclusion criteria included syndromal conditions (e.g., Turner syndrome), chronic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus), and active tumors. The primary objective was to compare the increase from baseline in height SDS after 1 year of treatment when HUMATROPE is administered according to an individually adjusted dose (IAD) regimen with a fixed high dose (FHD) regimen. Patients were randomized to either a FHD (0.067 mg/kg/day [0.47 mg/kg/week]; n=99) or an IAD treatment group (n=94). The initial HUMATROPE dosage in the IAD treatment group was 0.035 mg/kg/day (0.25 mg/kg/week). The dosage was increased to 0.067 mg/kg/day in those patients in the IAD group whose 1-year height gain predicted at Month 3 was <0.75 height SDS (n=40) or whose actual height gain measured at Year 1 was <0.75 height SDS (n=11). The results are presented in Table 14 , The increase from baseline in height SDS in the IAD group was non-inferior to that in the FHD group at Year 1 (mean between-group difference = -0.3 SDS [95% CI: -0.4, -0.2 SDS]). The results were similar when children who entered puberty during the study were removed from the analysis. Data is shown for the efficacy analysis population that included all patients who received at least 1 dose of HUMATROPE and had at least 1 post randomization height measurement. Approximately 85% of the randomized patients completed 2 years of therapy.

Mean chronological age at baseline was 9.3 \u00b1 0.9 years (range: 6.7 to 10.8). Additional study entry criteria included birth length SDS <-2 or <3rd percentile for gestational age, and height SDS for chronological age <-2. Exclusion criteria included syndromal conditions (e.g., Turner syndrome), and chronic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus). All 35 patients completed the study. Mean height SDS increased from a baseline value of -2.7 (SD 0.5) to -1.5 (SD 0.6) after 2 years of HUMATROPE treatment. 14.6 Adult Patients with Growth Hormone Deficiency Two multicenter studies in patients with adult-onset GH deficiency (n=98) and two studies in patients with childhood-onset GH deficiency (n=67) were designed to assess the effects of replacement therapy with HUMATROPE. Adult-onset patients and childhood-onset patients differed by diagnosis (organic vs. idiopathic pituitary disease), body size (average vs. small [mean height (171 cm vs 161 cm) and weight (85 kg vs 64 kg)]), and age (mean 44 vs. 29 years).Each study included a 6-month randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled phase, during which approximately half of the patients received placebo injections, while the other half received HUMATROPE injections. The HUMATROPE dosages for all studies were identical: 1 month of treatment at 0.00625 mg/kg/day followed by 0.0125 mg/kg/day for the next 5 months. The 6-month, double-blind phase was followed by 12 months of open-label HUMATROPE treatment for all patients. The primary efficacy measures were body composition (lean body mass and fat mass) and lipid parameters [Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)]. Lean body mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), validated with potassium 40. Body fat was assessed by BIA and sum of skinfold thickness. Lipid subfractions were analyzed by standard assay methods in a central laboratory. In a study with patients with adult-onset GH deficiency, HUMATROPE treatment (vs. placebo) resulted in an increase in mean lean body mass (2.59 vs. -0.22 kg, p<0.001) and a decrease in body fat (-3.27 vs. 0.56 kg, p<0.001). Similar changes were seen in childhood-onset GH deficient patients. These changes in lean body mass persisted throughout the 18-month period for both the adult-onset and childhood-onset groups; the changes in fat mass persisted in the childhood-onset group. Serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol which were low at baseline (mean, 31.0 mg/dL and 33.9 mg/dL in adult-onset (n=46) and childhood-onset (n=30) patients, respectively) had increased by the end of 18 months of HUMATROPE treatment (mean change of 13.7 and 11.1 mg/dL for the adult-onset (n=40) and childhood-onset (n=21) groups, respectively p<0.001; there was no adjustment for missing data). Total cholesterol and LDL did not show significant difference from baseline results by the end of 18 months of HUMATROPE treatment. In an additional 2-year, open-label, randomized study 149 patients with childhood-onset GH deficiency who had completed pediatric somatropin therapy, had attained final height (height velocity <1 cm/yr) and were confirmed to be GH-deficient as young adults, were randomized to receive HUMATROPE 0.0125 mg/kg/day (n=59), HUMATROPE 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=58), or no treatment (control) (n=32). Total bone mineral content (BMC) increased by 5.2% \u00b1 3.9% in the control group (n=28 for those with BMC measurements), 7.0% \u00b1 7.2% in the HUMATROPE 0.025 mg/kg/day group (n=51) and 8.0% \u00b1 8.9% in the HUMATROPE 0.0125 mg/kg/day group (n=51). For the treatment effect versus control group, p=0.012 (ANOVA); there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 HUMATROPE dose groups. A significant overall treatment effect (ANOVA, p=0.037) was seen for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMC, but not for femoral neck or hip."

      "Humatrope Cartrige Kit Instuctions for Use Instructions for Use HUMATROPE \u00ae (HU-ma-trope) (somatropin) For injection, for subcutaneous use Single-Patient-Use Cartridge Kit HUMATROPE cartridges are only to be used with the appropriate corresponding HumatroPen \u00ae injection devices supplied separately. Read this Instructions for Use before you start using HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your or your child's medical condition or treatment. Your healthcare provider should show you how to prepare, mix, measure, and inject HUMATROPE the right way before you use it for the first time. Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. How should I store HUMATROPE? Store HUMATROPE in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) before and after mixing. Do not freeze. Store HUMATROPE in the original carton to protect from light. HUMATROPE that has been mixed and is in liquid form must be used within 28 days. Throw away any mixed HUMATROPE left over after 28 days. Before giving an injection, check the expiration date on the Cartridge. Do not use the Cartridge if it has expired (See Figure A ). Important: HUMATROPE Cartridges should not be used if you are allergic to metacresol or glycerin. The HUMATROPE Cartridge is not recommended for use by blind or visually impaired individuals without the help of a sighted individual trained on how to use it. If your healthcare provider changes the prescribed cartridge strength you will need to get a new HumatroPen to match the new cartridge strength. Only use the following HUMATROPE cartridges with the following HumatroPen: 6 mg cartridge with HumatroPen 6 mg 12 mg cartridge with HumatroPen 12 mg 24 mg cartridge with HumatroPen 24 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit (See Figure A ) 1 Cartridge with 6 mg, 12 mg, or 24 mg of powdered HUMATROPE 1 prefilled syringe with Diluent (the liquid used to mix the powdered HUMATROPE) Note: There are 3 strengths of HUMATROPE Cartridges that have different amounts of HUMATROPE (6 mg, 12 mg, or 24 mg). Make sure that you have the Cartridge that your healthcare provider prescribed. Mixing the HUMATROPE in the Cartridge Only use the prefilled Diluent Syringe that comes with your HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit to mix the HUMATROPE in the Cartridge. Do not use the diluent that comes in the HUMATROPE vial box, or any other liquid. HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit mixing Instructions Parts (Figure A) Only use a HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit to prepare the HUMATROPE Cartridge. * Note : The liquid (Diluent) should be clear, colorless, and free of particles and is shown as blue in the figure (See Figure A ). Preparing Your New HUMATROPE Cartridge Start by thoroughly washing your hands. Remove all contents from the tray. Note: The HUMATROPE Cartridge is made for left or right handed use so you may handle it the way that is most comfortable for you. Hold the gray needle cover at the bottom of the Diluent Syringe. Pull the needle cover straight down to remove from the Diluent Syringe and throw it away. Do not push the plunger yet. It is okay if a drop of Diluent is seen. You do not have to release air from the Diluent Syringe. Hold the Cartridge, with the black triangles up toward the Diluent Syringe. Make sure the Cartridge and Diluent Syringe are facing each other in a straight line. Do not insert the Cartridge at an angle. Push the Cartridge straight into the Diluent Syringe until it stops and the black triangles are covered inside the Diluent Syringe. You may hear or feel a click. Do not twist the Cartridge. Hold the Diluent Syringe and the Cartridge together with both hands . Push and release the plunger 2 or 3 times until the Diluent is in the Cartridge. Remove your thumb from the plunger and check that the Diluent Syringe is empty. It is normal for small drops of Diluent to remain in the Diluent Syringe. With your thumb off the plunger, pull the Cartridge away from the Diluent Syringe. Place the end cap on a hard, flat surface. Push the Diluent Syringe onto the end cap and throw away the Diluent Syringe right away as instructed by your healthcare provider. Mix the medicine in the Cartridge by gently moving it in an up and down motion 10 times. Then let the Cartridge sit for 3 minutes. Do not shake. Check the HUMATROPE liquid, it should be clear. If the liquid is clear, your Cartridge is now prepared and ready to be attached to your HumatroPen (See the Instructions for Use for HumatroPen 6 mg, 12 mg or 24 mg). If the liquid is cloudy or contains particles, gently mix the medicine in the Cartridge 10 more times. Let the Cartridge sit for 5 more minutes. If the liquid still remains cloudy or contains particles, do not use the Cartridge. Contact your healthcare provider or call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com. If you have questions about preparing your HUMATROPE Cartridge, you should contact your healthcare provider. Talk to your healthcare provider about the right way to use your HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit and HumatroPen injection device, the right sites to inject HUMATROPE, and how to rotate your injection sites. Disposing of used Diluent Syringes: Put your used Diluent Syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: - made of a heavy-duty plastic, - can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, - upright and stable during use, - leak-resistant, and - properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Do not reuse or share your needles or syringes with other people. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal .

What you need to know about HumatroPen \u00ae 6 mg Read this Instructions for Use including the \u201cCommonly asked questions\u201d section, at the end of this Instructions for Use, before you start using HumatroPen 6 mg and each time you get a new Pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your or your child's medical condition or treatment. Your healthcare provider should show you how to use HumatroPen (Pen) the right way before you use it for the first time. Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. If you are having problems using the HumatroPen 6 mg, call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com. Introduction Intended Use: The HumatroPen 6 mg is a reusable pen-injector designed for self-administration of human growth hormone. The pen-injector is intended for use with the specified HUMATROPE 6 mg Cartridges and single use, detachable and disposable Pen Needles (supplied separately). Your healthcare provider will prescribe the HUMATROPE dose and Pen that is right for you or your child. Do not change your dose or use another type of Pen unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If your healthcare provider changes the prescribed cartridge strength from the 6 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge to the 12 mg or 24 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge, you will need to get a new HumatroPen to match the new cartridge strength. Contraindications: There are no known contraindications for HumatroPen 6 mg. Important information about HumatroPen 6 mg: Do not use the Pen if any part of the Pen or Cartridge looks broken or damaged. Contact your healthcare provider. Make sure that you have a 6 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge to match the HumatroPen 6 mg. If the strength on the label for the Cartridge and the Pen do not match, do not use them and contact your healthcare provider. It is important to use the correct Pen and Cartridge to make sure that you inject the correct dose of HUMATROPE. Do not use the HUMATROPE Cartridge past the expiration date. Follow the instructions in Section 2 only to set up a new Cartridge before you use it for the first time. Follow the instructions in Section 3 of this Instructions for Use for every injection. Do not transfer the contents of the HUMATROPE Cartridge to a syringe. Do not share your HumatroPen 6 mg or Pen Needles with anyone else, even if the Needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. The HumatroPen 6 mg is not recommended for use by blind or visually impaired individuals without the help of a sighted individual trained on how to use it. Information about Needles used with HumatroPen 6 mg: Pen Needles are not included with HumatroPen. You may need a prescription to get the Needles from your pharmacist. Becton, Dickinson and Company Pen Needles are recommended for use with the HumatroPen 6 mg. Ask your healthcare provider what size Needle is best for you to use. Use of the Hidden Needle Cover with your HumatroPen is optional. When using the Hidden Needle Cover with your HumatroPen, you must use a Needle length of 5 mm or longer. Read the Hidden Needle Cover Instructions for Use. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions about how to safely handle Needles. Always remove the Pen Needle after each injection and use a new Needle with each injection. This helps reduce the risk of infection, prevent leakage of HUMATROPE, reduce air bubbles, and reduce Needle clogs. For information on the right way to throw away (dispose of) used Needles, see \u201cDisposing of used Needles\u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use. How do I care for HumatroPen 6 mg? Soiled parts including the Hidden Needle Cover can be cleaned with a damp cloth. Do not use alcohol or any other cleaning product. Keep dry. Do not apply oil or any other lubricant. How do I store HumatroPen 6 mg with an attached cartridge? Store HumatroPen 6 mg between -40\u00b0C (-40\u00b0F) to 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F) without the Humatrope 6 mg Cartridge. After attaching a prepared HUMATROPE cartridge to your HumatroPen 6 mg, store it in the storage case in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C) until it is time for your next injection. Before injecting a dose of HUMATROPE, take the Pen out of the refrigerator and let it sit for 10 minutes to allow it to reach room temperature. Injecting medicine that is cold can cause discomfort. Do not leave the HumatroPen 6 mg and HUMATROPE cartridge out of the refrigerator for more than 30 minutes a day. HUMATROPE Cartridges attached to a Pen can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 28 days. Do not use a prepared Cartridge after 28 days. Do not freeze. Do not store the Pen with the Needle attached. Protect HUMATROPE Cartridges attached to the Pen from light during storage. When do I need to replace and dispose my HumatroPen? Do not use your Pen for more than 3 years after first use or past the Use-by date on the carton, whichever comes first. The expired Pen may be discarded in your household trash after you have removed the Needle. Record the date the Pen was first used here: __ / __ / __. Record the Use-by date from your carton here: __ / __ / __. Contact your healthcare provider if you need a new HumatroPen 6 mg, or when the Pen has been used for 3 years. Please see the accompanying complete Humatrope Patient Information Sheet. For more information, call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com. HumatroPen 6 mg Parts Section 2: Read Section 2 only after you have read Section 1. Getting Started Be sure to follow the reconstitution (mixing) directions in the HUMATROPE Cartridge Kit. Perform the New Cartridge Set-up only 1 time at the beginning of each new Cartridge preparation. For daily use, do not repeat the 1 time only New Cartridge Set-up. If you repeat the 1 time only New Cartridge Set-up, you may run out of HUMATROPE early. New Cartridge Set-up Step 2A \u2013 Check the Pen and Cartridge Front View Back View Be sure to check the Cartridge: - For 6 mg on the Cartridge Label - For the expiration date on the opposite side of the Cartridge - To see if the liquid is clear and free of particles Important Notes: Do not use the Cartridge past the expiration date. Do not use the Pen if any part of the Pen or Cartridge appears broken or damaged. Contact your healthcare provider. Pull off the Pen Cap. Look at the Injection Button and the Front Housing to make sure it is a 6 mg Pen. Important Note: Check the number on the Front Housing to make sure that it matches the Cartridge strength on the Cartridge label. If the Pen and Cartridge do not match, contact your healthcare provider. Step 2B \u2013 Attach the Cartridge The screw may be in or out when you get the Pen. If the screw is out, use the white tip of the Cartridge to push the screw back. Push the white tip of the mixed Cartridge into the Pen body. Screw the 6 mg Pen body onto the Cartridge until it is secure. Important Note: If the Cartridge is not completely attached, the screw may not move, and cause you to inject the wrong dose. Step 2C \u2013 Attach the Needle Remove the paper tab from the end of the Outer Cap. Push the Needle straight onto the 6 mg Cartridge and turn it until secure. Pull off the Outer Cap and the Inner Cap. Keep the Outer Cap to remove the Needle after the injection. Step 2D \u2013 Remove air from new Cartridge Turn the dose knob to dial 1.25 mg. Point the Needle straight up. Push the Injection Button and hold it for 5 seconds. Dial 0.05 mg and repeat these steps until liquid is seen at the Needle tip. Important Notes: The Pen must be set-up before injecting the first dose from each new 6 mg Cartridge.

The purpose of the New Cartridge Set-up is to make sure the HumatroPen 6 mg with an attached HUMATROPE 6 mg Cartridge are ready to use. If you repeat the New Cartridge Set-up before each routine dose, you may run out of HUMATROPE early. The small amount of medicine used in the New Cartridge Set-up will not affect the amount of HUMATROPE in the Cartridge. What should I do if the Cartridge label and Pen do not match?

Do not use the Pen if the liquid is cloudy or contains particles. Contact your healthcare provider or call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com .

The Injection Button may become harder to push if the inside of the Pen gets dirty with HUMATROPE, food, drink, or other materials. What should I do if the dose knob does not go to zero (0) when I inject the dose? This can happen if the HUMATROPE Cartridge does not have enough HUMATROPE left in it for the full dose.

It is normal for a single drop to remain on the tip of the Needle after the injection is complete. If you see more than 1 drop: - The full dose may not have been delivered. Do not inject another dose. Talk with your healthcare provider for assistance. - To prevent this, for the next dose, firmly push and hold the Injection Button in and slowly count to 5 (see Section 3, Step 3C).

If you are having problems using the HumatroPen 24 mg, call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com. Introduction Intended Use: The HumatroPen 24 mg is a reusable pen-injector designed for self-administration of human growth hormone. The pen-injector is intended for use with the specified HUMATROPE 24 mg Cartridges and single use, detachable and disposable Pen Needles (supplied separately). Your healthcare provider will prescribe the HUMATROPE dose and Pen that is right for you or your child. Do not change your dose or use another type of pen unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If your healthcare provider changes the prescribed cartridge strength from the 24 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge to the 6 mg or 12 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge, you will need to get a new HumatroPen to match the new cartridge strength. Contraindications: There are no known contraindications for HumatroPen 24 mg. Important information about HumatroPen 24 mg: Do not use the Pen if any part of the Pen or Cartridge looks broken or damaged. Contact your healthcare provider. Make sure that you have a 24 mg HUMATROPE Cartridge to match the HumatroPen 24 mg. If the strength on the label for the Cartridge and the Pen do not match, do not use them and contact your healthcare provider. It is important to use the correct Pen and Cartridge to make sure that you inject the correct dose of HUMATROPE. Do not use the HUMATROPE Cartridge past the expiration date. Follow the instructions in Section 2 only to set up a new Cartridge before you use it for the first time. Follow the instructions in Section 3 of this Instructions for Use for every injection. Do not transfer the contents of the HUMATROPE Cartridge to a syringe. Do not share your HumatroPen 24 mg or Pen Needles with anyone else, even if the Needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. The HumatroPen 24 mg is not recommended for use by blind or visually impaired individuals without the help of a sighted individual trained on how to use it. Information about Needles used with HumatroPen 24 mg: Pen Needles are not included with HumatroPen. You may need a prescription to get the Needles from your pharmacist. Becton, Dickinson and Company Pen Needles are recommended for use with the HumatroPen 24 mg. Ask your healthcare provider what size Needle is best for you to use.

Continue to hold the Injection Button for 5 seconds, then remove the Needle from the skin. Check to make sure you see a 0.00 in the dose window. This means that the complete dose was injected. Important Note: It is possible to set a dose larger than the amount of HUMATROPE left in the Cartridge. At the end of the injection, the number in the dose window should be 0.00 . If you see any number other than \u201c0.00\u201d, this is the amount of HUMATROPE you did not receive . Write this number down and follow the steps below to get the rest of your dose. Remove the Needle and empty Cartridge from the Pen. Repeat Steps 2A through 2D. Complete your dose by injecting only the amount you did not receive .

When using the Hidden Needle Cover with HumatroPen 24 mg, repeat steps 1 to 10 of the Hidden Needle Cover Instructions for Use. Commonly asked questions: Do I need to perform the New Cartridge Setup before every dose? No. You only need to perform the New Cartridge Set-up 1 time for each Cartridge, just before a new Cartridge is used for the first time. The purpose of the New Cartridge Set-up is to make sure the HumatroPen 24 mg with an attached HUMATROPE 24 mg Cartridge are ready to use. If you repeat the New Cartridge Set-up before each routine dose, you may run out of HUMATROPE early. The small amount of medicine used in the New Cartridge Set-up will not affect the amount of HUMATROPE in the Cartridge. What should I do if the Cartridge label and Pen do not match? Do not use the Pen if the Cartridge strength on the HUMATROPE Cartridge label does not match the number on the Pen's Front Housing. This is important to make sure the correct dose of HUMATROPE is given. Contact your healthcare provider for a replacement. What should I do if the HUMATROPE is not clear? Do not use the Pen if the liquid is cloudy or contains particles. Contact your healthcare provider or call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com . Why are there air bubbles in the Cartridge? Air bubbles may remain in the Cartridge after mixing. If the Pen is stored with a Needle attached, air bubbles may form in the Cartridge. Do not store the Pen with a Needle attached. Follow the instructions in Section 2, Step 2D (Remove air from new Cartridge) to remove air bubbles from the Cartridge. It is normal to see small air bubbles. It will not cause any harm or affect the dose. What should I do if the screw does not move out when there is no Cartridge attached to the Pen? The screw may not move out when you push the Injection Button unless there is a Cartridge in the Pen. This allows you to easily push the screw into the Pen body when replacing a Cartridge. After a Cartridge is attached, the screw will move out when the Injection Button is pushed. What should I do if I cannot attach the Cartridge to the Pen Body? Check that the Cartridge is not damaged or broken. Carefully line up the Cartridge with the Pen body and screw them together until secure. If the Cartridge and Pen cannot be screwed together, contact your healthcare provider. Why is it hard to push the Injection Button when I try to inject the dose? The Needle may be clogged. Try attaching a new Needle. Pushing the Injection Button down quickly may make the Injection Button harder to push. Pushing the Injection Button more slowly may make it easier. Using a larger Needle will make it easier to push the Injection Button during injection. Ask your healthcare provider which Needle is best for you. The Injection Button may become harder to push if the inside of the Pen gets dirty with HUMATROPE, food, drink, or other materials. What should I do if the dose knob does not go to zero (0) when I inject the dose? This can happen if the HUMATROPE Cartridge does not have enough HUMATROPE left in it for the full dose. At the end of the injection, the number in the dose window should be 0.00 . If you see any number other than \u201c0.00\u201d, this is the amount of HUMATROPE you did not receive . Write this number down and follow the steps below to get the rest of your dose. To get the rest of your dose: - Remove the Needle and empty Cartridge from the Pen. - Insert a new Cartridge, attach a new Needle, and remove air from the new Cartridge (see Steps 2A through 2D). - Complete your dose by injecting only the amount you did not receive (see Step 3C). - If you still do not think you received your full dose, do not take another dose. Call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or your healthcare provider for assistance. What should I do if I see HUMATROPE leaking from the Needle after I have finished the injection? It is normal for a single drop to remain on the tip of the Needle after the injection is complete. If you see more than 1 drop: - The full dose may not have been delivered. Do not inject another dose. Talk with your healthcare provider for assistance. - To prevent this, for the next dose, firmly push and hold the Injection Button in and slowly count to 5 (see Section 3, Step 3C). How can I tell when the injection is complete? The injection is complete when: - You place your thumb on the Injection Button, then slowly and firmly push the Injection Button until it stops moving . - Continue to hold the Injection Button for 5 seconds, then remove the Needle from the skin. - You will see 0.00 in the center of the dose window.

GENOTROPIN is indicated for the treatment of growth failure in pediatric patients born small for gestational age (SGA) who fail to manifest catch-up growth by age 2 years. GENOTROPIN is indicated for the treatment of growth failure associated with Turner syndrome. GENOTROPIN is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic short stature (ISS), also called non-growth hormone-deficient short stature, defined by height standard deviation score (SDS) \u2264-2.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range, in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed and for whom diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes associated with short stature that should be observed or treated by other means. 1.2 Adult Patients GENOTROPIN is indicated for replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency who meet either of the following two criteria: Adult Onset (AO): Patients who have growth hormone deficiency, either alone or associated with multiple hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism), as a result of pituitary disease, hypothalamic disease, surgery, radiation therapy, or trauma; or Childhood Onset (CO) : Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients who were treated with somatropin for growth hormone deficiency in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for growth hormone deficient adults. According to current standards, confirmation of the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency in both groups involves an appropriate growth hormone provocative test with two exceptions: (1) patients with multiple other pituitary hormone deficiencies due to organic disease; and (2) patients with congenital/genetic growth hormone deficiency."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The weekly dose should be divided into 6 or 7 subcutaneous injections. GENOTROPIN must not be injected intravenously. Therapy with GENOTROPIN should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with growth failure associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Turner syndrome (TS), those who were born small for gestational age (SGA) or Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS), and adult patients with either childhood onset or adult onset GHD. GENOTROPIN should be administered subcutaneously ( 2 ) \u2022 Pediatric GHD: 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Prader-Willi Syndrome: 0.24 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Small for Gestational Age: Up to 0.48 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Turner Syndrome: 0.33 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Idiopathic Short Stature: up to 0.47 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult GHD: Either a non-weight based or a weight based dosing regimen may be followed, with doses adjusted based on treatment response and IGF-I concentrations ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Non-weight based dosing: A starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15\u20130.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight, and increased gradually every 1\u20132 months by increments of approximately 0.1\u20130.2 mg/day. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Weight based dosing: The recommended initial dose is not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week; the dose may be increased as tolerated to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week at 4\u20138 week intervals. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 GENOTROPIN cartridges are color-coded to correspond to a specific GENOTROPIN PEN delivery device ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Injection sites should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Dosing of Pediatric Patients General Pediatric Dosing Information The GENOTROPIN dosage and administration schedule should be individualized based on the growth response of each patient. Response to somatropin therapy in pediatric patients tends to decrease with time. However, in pediatric patients, the failure to increase growth rate, particularly during the first year of therapy, indicates the need for close assessment of compliance and evaluation for other causes of growth failure, such as hypothyroidism, undernutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human GH (rhGH). Treatment with GENOTROPIN for short stature should be discontinued when the epiphyses are fused. Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Generally, a dose of 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. Prader-Willi Syndrome Generally, a dose of 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. Turner Syndrom e Generally, a dose of 0.33 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. Idiopathic Short Stature Generally, a dose up to 0.47 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. Small for Gestational Age Recent literature has recommended initial treatment with larger doses of somatropin (e.g., 0.48 mg/kg/week), especially in very short children (i.e., height SDS <\u20133), and/or older/ pubertal children, and that a reduction in dosage (e.g., gradually towards 0.24 mg/kg/week) should be considered if substantial catch-up growth is observed during the first few years of therapy. On the other hand, in younger SGA children (e.g., approximately <4 years) (who respond the best in general) with less severe short stature (i.e., baseline height SDS values between -2 and -3), consideration should be given to initiating treatment at a lower dose (e.g., 0.24 mg/kg/week), and titrating the dose as needed over time. In all children, clinicians should carefully monitor the growth response, and adjust the somatropin dose as necessary. Generally, a dose of up to 0.48 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. 2.2 Dosing of Adult Patients Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Either of two approaches to GENOTROPIN dosing may be followed: a non-weight based regimen or a weight based regimen. Non-weight based \u2014 based on published consensus guidelines, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15\u20130.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1\u20132 months by increments of approximately 0.1\u20130.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations. The dose should be decreased as necessary on the basis of adverse events and/or serum IGF-I concentrations above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients. Weight based \u2014 based on the dosing regimen used in the original adult GHD registration trials, the recommended dosage at the start of treatment is not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week. The dose may be increased according to individual patient requirements to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week at 4\u20138 week intervals. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-I concentrations should be used as guidance in dose titration. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women. 2.3 Preparation and Administration The GENOTROPIN 5 and 12 mg cartridges are color-coded to help ensure proper use with the GENOTROPIN PEN delivery device. The 5 mg cartridge has a green tip to match the green pen window on the Pen 5, while the 12 mg cartridge has a purple tip to match the purple pen window on the Pen 12. Parenteral drug products should always be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. GENOTROPIN MUST NOT BE INJECTED if the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter. Use it only if it is clear and colorless. GENOTROPIN may be given in the thigh, buttocks, or abdomen; the site of SC injections should be rotated daily to help prevent lipoatrophy."

There have been reports of sudden death when somatropin was used in such patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. \u2022 Active Malignancy In general, somatropin is contraindicated in the presence of active malignancy. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with somatropin. Somatropin should be discontinued if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Since growth hormone deficiency may be an early sign of the presence of a pituitary tumor (or, rarely, other brain tumors), the presence of such tumors should be ruled out prior to initiation of treatment. Somatropin should not be used in patients with any evidence of progression or recurrence of an underlying intracranial tumor. \u2022 Hypersensitivity GENOTROPIN is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of its excipients. The 5 mg and 12 mg presentations of GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder contain m-cresol as a preservative. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . \u2022 Diabetic Retinopathy Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \u2022 Closed Epiphyses Somatropin should not be used for growth promotion in pediatric patients with closed epiphyses."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment Discontinue treatment if these signs occur ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome \u2013 especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen. Monitor thyroid function periodically ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: Monitor any child with scoliosis for progression of the curve ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain ( 5.15 ) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4) ]. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3\u20138 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4) ] . Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment. New-onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral/injectable agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropins. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesia) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with growth hormone deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphyses in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphyses may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin, including GENOTROPIN. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during GENOTROPIN therapy should be evaluated for slipped capital femoral epiphysis and osteonecrosis and managed accordingly. 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated Turner syndrome patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.12 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, hypertension) as these patients are also at risk for these conditions. 5.13 Lipoatrophy When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase during somatropin therapy. 5.15 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin\u2013treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain."

Clinical Trials in children with GHD In clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric GHD patients, the following events were reported infrequently: injection site reactions, including pain or burning associated with the injection, fibrosis, nodules, rash, inflammation, pigmentation, or bleeding; lipoatrophy; headache; hematuria; hypothyroidism; and mild hyperglycemia. Clinical Trials in PWS In two clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, the following drug-related events were reported: edema, aggressiveness, arthralgia, benign intracranial hypertension, hair loss, headache, and myalgia. Clinical Trials in children with SGA In clinical studies of 273 pediatric patients born small for gestational age treated with GENOTROPIN, the following clinically significant events were reported: mild transient hyperglycemia, one patient with benign intracranial hypertension, two patients with central precocious puberty, two patients with jaw prominence, and several patients with aggravation of preexisting scoliosis, injection site reactions, and self-limited progression of pigmented nevi. Anti-hGH antibodies were not detected in any of the patients treated with GENOTROPIN. Clinical Trials in children with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome, the most frequently reported adverse events were respiratory illnesses (influenza, tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis), joint pain, and urinary tract infection. The only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than 1 patient was joint pain. Clinical Trials in children with Idiopathic Short Stature In two open-label clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with ISS, the most commonly encountered adverse events include upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia. In one of the two studies, during GENOTROPIN treatment, the mean IGF-1 standard deviation (SD) scores were maintained in the normal range. IGF-1 SD scores above +2 SD were observed as follows: 1 subject (3%), 10 subjects (30%) and 16 subjects (38%) in the untreated control, 0. 23 and the 0.47 mg/kg/week groups, respectively, had at least one measurement; while 0 subjects (0%), 2 subjects (7%) and 6 subjects (14%) had two or more consecutive IGF-1 measurements above +2 SD. Clinical Trials in adults with GHD In clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in 1,145 GHD adults, the majority of the adverse events consisted of mild to moderate symptoms of fluid retention, including peripheral swelling, arthralgia, pain and stiffness of the extremities, peripheral edema, myalgia, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia. These events were reported early during therapy and tended to be transient and/or responsive to dosage reduction. Table 1 displays the adverse events reported by 5% or more of adult GHD patients in clinical trials after various durations of treatment with GENOTROPIN. Also presented are the corresponding incidence rates of these adverse events in placebo patients during the 6-month double-blind portion of the clinical trials. Table 1.

All 12 patients had predisposing factors, e.g., elevated glycated hemoglobin levels and/or marked obesity, prior to receiving GENOTROPIN. Of the 3,031 patients receiving GENOTROPIN, 61 (2%) developed symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which lessened after dosage reduction or treatment interruption (52) or surgery (9). Other adverse events that have been reported include generalized edema and hypoesthesia. Periplasmic Escherichia coli Peptides Preparations of GENOTROPIN contain a small amount of periplasmic Escherichia coli peptides (PECP). Anti-PECP antibodies are found in a small number of patients treated with GENOTROPIN, but these appear to be of no clinical significance. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of somatropin or GENOTROPIN. Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The following serious adverse reactions have been observed with use of somatropin (including events observed in patients who received brands of somatropin other than GENOTROPIN): acute critical illness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , intracranial tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] , central hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] , cardiovascular disorders, and pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and osteonecrosis/avascular necrosis (including Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease) have been reported in children treated with growth hormone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Cases have been reported with GENOTROPIN . The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the appropriate use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), and significant diabetic retinopathy. New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11\u00df-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses ( 7.1 , 7.2 ). \u2022 Glucocorticoid Replacement: Should be carefully adjusted ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment ( 7.5 ) 7.1 11 \u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 The microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] . 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth\u2011promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen In patients on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral/injectable agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with somatropin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal studies (rats and rabbits), there was no evidence of embryo\u2011fetal or neonatal harm following somatropin administration during organogenesis at doses approximately 24 times and 19 times the recommended human therapeutic levels, respectively, based on body surface area ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies with somatropin during the period of organogenesis at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3.3 mg/kg/day administered subcutaneously (SC) in pregnant rats and 0.08, 0.3, and 1.3 mg/kg/day administered intramuscularly in pregnant rabbits were not teratogenic (highest doses approximately 24 times and 19 times the recommended human therapeutic levels, respectively, based on body surface area). In perinatal and postnatal studies in rats, somatropin doses of 0.3, 1, and 3.3 mg/kg/day produced growth\u2011promoting effects in the dams but not in the fetuses. Young rats at the highest dose showed increased weight gain during suckling but the effect was not apparent by 10 weeks of age. No adverse effects were observed on gestation, morphogenesis, parturition, lactation, postnatal development, or reproductive capacity of the offspring due to somatropin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of somatropin in human milk. Limited published data indicate that exogenous somatropin does not increase normal breastmilk concentrations of growth hormone. No adverse effects related to somatropin in the breastfeed infant have been reported. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for GENOTROPIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from GENOTROPIN or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients have been established in growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), growth failure in children born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by age 2 years, growth failure associated with Turner syndrome, idiopathic short stature (ISS) and growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone. Growth Failure Due to Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) Safety and effectiveness of GENOTROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome based on data from two randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in 43 pediatric patients. There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Short Stature in Pediatric Patients Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2 Safety and effectiveness of GENOTROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with short stature born SGA with no catch-up growth based on data from 4 randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in 209 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Short Stature associated with Turner Syndrome Safety and effectiveness of GENOTROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with short stature associated with Turner syndrome based on data from two randomized, open-label, clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in 38 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) Safety and effectiveness of GENOTROPIN have been established in pediatric patients with ISS based on data from one randomized, open-label, clinical trial with GENOTROPIN in 102 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of GENOTROPIN in patients aged 65 and over have not been evaluated in clinical studies. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of GENOTROPIN, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro, preclinical, and clinical tests have demonstrated that GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder is therapeutically equivalent to human growth hormone of pituitary origin and achieves similar pharmacokinetic profiles in normal adults. In pediatric patients who have growth hormone deficiency (GHD), have Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), were born small for gestational age (SGA), have Turner syndrome (TS), or have Idiopathic short stature (ISS), treatment with GENOTROPIN stimulates linear growth. In patients with GHD or PWS, treatment with GENOTROPIN also normalizes concentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I/Somatomedin C). In adults with GHD, treatment with GENOTROPIN results in reduced fat mass, increased lean body mass, metabolic alterations that include beneficial changes in lipid metabolism, and normalization of IGF-I concentrations. In addition, the following actions have been demonstrated for GENOTROPIN and/or somatropin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tissue Growth A. Skeletal Growth: GENOTROPIN stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD, PWS, SGA, TS, or ISS. The measurable increase in body length after administration of GENOTROPIN results from an effect on the epiphyseal plates of long bones. Concentrations of IGF-I, which may play a role in skeletal growth, are generally low in the serum of pediatric patients with GHD, PWS, or SGA, but tend to increase during treatment with GENOTROPIN. Elevations in mean serum alkaline phosphatase concentration are also seen. B. Cell Growth: It has been shown that there are fewer skeletal muscle cells in short-statured pediatric patients who lack endogenous growth hormone as compared with the normal pediatric population. Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and size of muscle cells. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. Nitrogen retention, as demonstrated by decreased urinary nitrogen excretion and serum urea nitrogen, follows the initiation of therapy with GENOTROPIN. Carbohydrate Metabolism Pediatric patients with hypopituitarism sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with GENOTROPIN. Large doses of growth hormone may impair glucose tolerance. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin has resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, and increased plasma fatty acids. Mineral Metabolism Somatropin induces retention of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Serum concentrations of inorganic phosphate are increased in patients with GHD after therapy with GENOTROPIN. Serum calcium is not significantly altered by GENOTROPIN. Growth hormone could increase calciuria. Body Composition Adult GHD patients treated with GENOTROPIN at the recommended adult dose [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] demonstrate a decrease in fat mass and an increase in lean body mass. When these alterations are coupled with the increase in total body water, the overall effect of GENOTROPIN is to modify body composition, an effect that is maintained with continued treatment. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a 0.03 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection in the thigh of 1.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN to adult GHD patients, approximately 80% of the dose was systemically available as compared with that available following intravenous dosing. Results were comparable in both male and female patients. Similar bioavailability has been observed in healthy adult male subjects. In healthy adult males, following an SC injection in the thigh of 0.03 mg/kg, the extent of absorption (AUC) of a concentration of 5.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN was 35% greater than that for 1.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN. The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak (C max ) serum levels were 23.0 (\u00b1 9.4) ng/mL and 17.4 (\u00b1 9.2) ng/mL, respectively. In a similar study involving pediatric GHD patients, 5.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN yielded a mean AUC that was 17% greater than that for 1.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN. The mean C max levels were 21.0 ng/mL and 16.3 ng/mL, respectively. Adult GHD patients received two single SC doses of 0.03 mg/kg of GENOTROPIN at a concentration of 1.3 mg/mL, with a one- to four-week washout period between injections. Mean C max levels were 12.4 ng/mL (first injection) and 12.2 ng/mL (second injection), achieved at approximately six hours after dosing. There are no data on the bioequivalence between the 12 mg/mL formulation and either the 1.3 mg/mL or the 5.3 mg/mL formulations. Distribution The mean volume of distribution of GENOTROPIN following administration to GHD adults was estimated to be 1.3 (\u00b1 0.8) L/kg. Metabolism The metabolic fate of GENOTROPIN involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. In renal cells, at least a portion of the breakdown products are returned to the systemic circulation. The mean terminal half-life of intravenous GENOTROPIN in normal adults is 0.4 hours, whereas subcutaneously administered GENOTROPIN has a half-life of 3.0 hours in GHD adults. The observed difference is due to slow absorption from the subcutaneous injection site. Excretion The mean clearance of subcutaneously administered GENOTROPIN in 16 GHD adult patients was 0.3 (\u00b1 0.11) L/hrs/kg. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of GENOTROPIN are similar in GHD pediatric and adult patients. Gender: No gender studies have been performed in pediatric patients; however, in GHD adults, the absolute bioavailability of GENOTROPIN was similar in males and females. Race: No studies have been conducted with GENOTROPIN to assess pharmacokinetic differences among races. Renal or hepatic insufficiency: No studies have been conducted with GENOTROPIN in these patient populations. Table 2.

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of GENOTROPIN or other somatropins. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed. In 419 pediatric patients evaluated in clinical studies with GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder, 244 had been treated previously with GENOTROPIN or other growth hormone preparations and 175 had received no previous growth hormone therapy. Antibodies to growth hormone (anti-hGH antibodies) were present in six previously treated patients at baseline. Three of the six became negative for anti-hGH antibodies during 6 to 12 months of treatment with GENOTROPIN. Of the remaining 413 patients, eight (1.9%) developed detectable anti-hGH antibodies during treatment with GENOTROPIN; none had an antibody binding capacity >2 mg/L. There was no evidence that the growth response to GENOTROPIN was affected in these antibody-positive patients."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro, preclinical, and clinical tests have demonstrated that GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder is therapeutically equivalent to human growth hormone of pituitary origin and achieves similar pharmacokinetic profiles in normal adults. In pediatric patients who have growth hormone deficiency (GHD), have Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), were born small for gestational age (SGA), have Turner syndrome (TS), or have Idiopathic short stature (ISS), treatment with GENOTROPIN stimulates linear growth. In patients with GHD or PWS, treatment with GENOTROPIN also normalizes concentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I/Somatomedin C). In adults with GHD, treatment with GENOTROPIN results in reduced fat mass, increased lean body mass, metabolic alterations that include beneficial changes in lipid metabolism, and normalization of IGF-I concentrations. In addition, the following actions have been demonstrated for GENOTROPIN and/or somatropin."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Tissue Growth A. Skeletal Growth: GENOTROPIN stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with GHD, PWS, SGA, TS, or ISS. The measurable increase in body length after administration of GENOTROPIN results from an effect on the epiphyseal plates of long bones. Concentrations of IGF-I, which may play a role in skeletal growth, are generally low in the serum of pediatric patients with GHD, PWS, or SGA, but tend to increase during treatment with GENOTROPIN. Elevations in mean serum alkaline phosphatase concentration are also seen. B. Cell Growth: It has been shown that there are fewer skeletal muscle cells in short-statured pediatric patients who lack endogenous growth hormone as compared with the normal pediatric population. Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and size of muscle cells. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by increased cellular protein synthesis. Nitrogen retention, as demonstrated by decreased urinary nitrogen excretion and serum urea nitrogen, follows the initiation of therapy with GENOTROPIN. Carbohydrate Metabolism Pediatric patients with hypopituitarism sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with GENOTROPIN. Large doses of growth hormone may impair glucose tolerance. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin has resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, and increased plasma fatty acids. Mineral Metabolism Somatropin induces retention of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Serum concentrations of inorganic phosphate are increased in patients with GHD after therapy with GENOTROPIN. Serum calcium is not significantly altered by GENOTROPIN. Growth hormone could increase calciuria. Body Composition Adult GHD patients treated with GENOTROPIN at the recommended adult dose [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] demonstrate a decrease in fat mass and an increase in lean body mass. When these alterations are coupled with the increase in total body water, the overall effect of GENOTROPIN is to modify body composition, an effect that is maintained with continued treatment."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a 0.03 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection in the thigh of 1.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN to adult GHD patients, approximately 80% of the dose was systemically available as compared with that available following intravenous dosing. Results were comparable in both male and female patients. Similar bioavailability has been observed in healthy adult male subjects. In healthy adult males, following an SC injection in the thigh of 0.03 mg/kg, the extent of absorption (AUC) of a concentration of 5.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN was 35% greater than that for 1.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN. The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak (C max ) serum levels were 23.0 (\u00b1 9.4) ng/mL and 17.4 (\u00b1 9.2) ng/mL, respectively. In a similar study involving pediatric GHD patients, 5.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN yielded a mean AUC that was 17% greater than that for 1.3 mg/mL GENOTROPIN. The mean C max levels were 21.0 ng/mL and 16.3 ng/mL, respectively. Adult GHD patients received two single SC doses of 0.03 mg/kg of GENOTROPIN at a concentration of 1.3 mg/mL, with a one- to four-week washout period between injections. Mean C max levels were 12.4 ng/mL (first injection) and 12.2 ng/mL (second injection), achieved at approximately six hours after dosing. There are no data on the bioequivalence between the 12 mg/mL formulation and either the 1.3 mg/mL or the 5.3 mg/mL formulations. Distribution The mean volume of distribution of GENOTROPIN following administration to GHD adults was estimated to be 1.3 (\u00b1 0.8) L/kg. Metabolism The metabolic fate of GENOTROPIN involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. In renal cells, at least a portion of the breakdown products are returned to the systemic circulation. The mean terminal half-life of intravenous GENOTROPIN in normal adults is 0.4 hours, whereas subcutaneously administered GENOTROPIN has a half-life of 3.0 hours in GHD adults. The observed difference is due to slow absorption from the subcutaneous injection site. Excretion The mean clearance of subcutaneously administered GENOTROPIN in 16 GHD adult patients was 0.3 (\u00b1 0.11) L/hrs/kg. Special Populations Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of GENOTROPIN are similar in GHD pediatric and adult patients. Gender: No gender studies have been performed in pediatric patients; however, in GHD adults, the absolute bioavailability of GENOTROPIN was similar in males and females. Race: No studies have been conducted with GENOTROPIN to assess pharmacokinetic differences among races. Renal or hepatic insufficiency: No studies have been conducted with GENOTROPIN in these patient populations. Table 2.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder was compared with placebo in six randomized clinical trials involving a total of 172 adult GHD patients. These trials included a 6-month double-blind treatment period, during which 85 patients received GENOTROPIN and 87 patients received placebo, followed by an open-label treatment period in which participating patients received GENOTROPIN for up to a total of 24 months. GENOTROPIN was administered as a daily SC injection at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/week for the first month of treatment and 0.08 mg/kg/week for subsequent months. Beneficial changes in body composition were observed at the end of the 6-month treatment period for the patients receiving GENOTROPIN as compared with the placebo patients. Lean body mass, total body water, and lean/fat ratio increased while total body fat mass and waist circumference decreased. These effects on body composition were maintained when treatment was continued beyond 6 months. Bone mineral density declined after 6 months of treatment but returned to baseline values after 12 months of treatment. 14.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) The safety and efficacy of GENOTROPIN in the treatment of pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials. Patients received either GENOTROPIN or no treatment for the first year of the studies, while all patients received GENOTROPIN during the second year. GENOTROPIN was administered as a daily SC injection, and the dose was calculated for each patient every 3 months. In Study 1, the treatment group received GENOTROPIN at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week during the entire study. During the second year, the control group received GENOTROPIN at a dose of 0.48 mg/kg/week. In Study 2, the treatment group received GENOTROPIN at a dose of 0.36 mg/kg/week during the entire study. During the second year, the control group received GENOTROPIN at a dose of 0.36 mg/kg/week. Patients who received GENOTROPIN showed significant increases in linear growth during the first year of study, compared with patients who received no treatment (see Table 3 ). Linear growth continued to increase in the second year, when both groups received treatment with GENOTROPIN. Table 3.

These changes included a decrease in the amount of fat mass, and increases in the amount of lean body mass and the ratio of lean-to-fat tissue, while changes in body weight were similar to those seen in patients who received no treatment. Treatment with GENOTROPIN did not accelerate bone age, compared with patients who received no treatment. Table 4.

Patients (age range of 2 to 8 years) were observed for 12 months before being randomized to receive either GENOTROPIN (two doses per study, most often 0.24 and 0.48 mg/kg/week) as a daily SC injection or no treatment for the first 24 months of the studies. After 24 months in the studies, all patients received GENOTROPIN. Patients who received any dose of GENOTROPIN showed significant increases in growth during the first 24 months of study, compared with patients who received no treatment (see Table 5 ). Children receiving 0.48 mg/kg/week demonstrated a significant improvement in height standard deviation score (SDS) compared with children treated with 0.24 mg/kg/week. Both of these doses resulted in a slower but constant increase in growth between months 24 to 72 (data not shown). Table 5.

Turner syndrome patients were treated with GENOTROPIN alone or GENOTROPIN plus adjunctive hormonal therapy (ethinylestradiol or oxandrolone). A total of 38 patients were treated with GENOTROPIN alone in the two studies. In Study 055, 22 patients were treated for 12 months, and in Study 092, 16 patients were treated for 12 months. Patients received GENOTROPIN at a dose between 0.13 to 0.33 mg/kg/week. SDS for height velocity and height are expressed using either the Tanner (Study 055) or Semp\u00e9 (Study 092) standards for age-matched normal children as well as the Ranke standard (both studies) for age-matched, untreated Turner syndrome patients. As seen in Table 6, height velocity SDS and height SDS values were smaller at baseline and after treatment with GENOTROPIN when the normative standards were utilized as opposed to the Turner syndrome standard. Both studies demonstrated statistically significant increases from baseline in all of the linear growth variables (i.e., mean height velocity, height velocity SDS, and height SDS) after treatment with GENOTROPIN (see Table 6 ). The linear growth response was greater in Study 055 wherein patients were treated with a larger dose of GENOTROPIN. Table 6.

Patients were enrolled on the basis of short stature, stimulated GH secretion >10 ng/mL, and prepubertal status (criteria for idiopathic short stature were retrospectively applied and included 126 patients). All patients were observed for height progression for 12 months and were subsequently randomized to GENOTROPIN or observation only and followed to final height. Two GENOTROPIN doses were evaluated in this trial: 0.23 mg/kg/week (0.033 mg/kg/day) and 0.47 mg/kg/week (0.067 mg/kg/day). Baseline patient characteristics for the ISS patients who remained prepubertal at randomization (n= 105) were: mean (\u00b1 SD): chronological age 11.4 (1.3) years, height SDS -2.4 (0.4), height velocity SDS -1.1 (0.8), and height velocity 4.4 (0.9) cm/yr, IGF-1 SDS -0.8 (1.4). Patients were treated for a median duration of 5.7 years. Results for final height SDS are displayed by treatment arm in Table 7. GENOTROPIN therapy improved final height in ISS children relative to untreated controls. The observed mean gain in final height was 9.8 cm for females and 5.0 cm for males for both doses combined compared to untreated control subjects. A height gain of 1 SDS was observed in 10% of untreated subjects, 50% of subjects receiving 0.23 mg/kg/week and 69% of subjects receiving 0.47 mg/kg/week. Table 7.

The new panel simply clicks into place ( See Figure AA ). Figure AA Caring for your Pen To clean your pen, wipe the outside surface with a damp cloth. Do not put the pen in water or this may damage your pen. Do not use alcohol or any other cleaning agents to clean the pen, as they may damage the plastic body. To clean the needle guard, wipe it with a damp cloth or alcohol pad. Questions and Answers Question Answer How long is the use period of my pen? The pen has a use period of 2 years starting from the first use by the patient. How can I tell how much GENOTROPIN is left in my pen? The indicative scale along the side of the cartridge window is a guide. The number that aligns with the front edge of the rubber stopper shows you how many milligrams are left in the cartridge. If your cartridge is nearly empty you can also dial the injection button until it cannot go any further. The dose display will then show the maximum dose that can be delivered. When the cartridge is empty, the injection button will not turn any further. If the display does not work, can my pen still be used? Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible to get a new pen. What happens if I dial the injection button beyond the maximum dose ('2.0' mg)? Some liquid may appear from the needle tip, and the numbers may disappear from the dose display. This is normal and will not affect your injection. To correct this, turn the injection button in the opposite direction of the arrow until numbers reappear on the dose display. Then dial back to your correct dose. Why is it difficult to turn or push the injection button? The injection button may become difficult to turn or to push. This may occur if the pen gets dirty due to contact with food, liquids or GENOTROPIN, or if the needle becomes clogged. Contact your healthcare provider if the issue does not resolve. Display Information: Steady The selected dose size. The number indicates the dose size (in mg) that your pen will deliver if the injection button is fully pressed in. Steady A dose is not set.

Figure Z Step 14. Throwing away (disposing of) used needles, cartridges and your GENOTROPIN PEN 12 Put the used needles and cartridges in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the needles and cartridges in the household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 Made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 Can be closed with a tight fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 Upright and stable during use, \u2022 Leak-resistant, and \u2022 Properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and cartridges. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . \u2022 Do not reuse needles. \u2022 Do not throw away (dispose of) your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. \u2022 Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Important : Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children. Dispose of the entire GENOTROPIN PEN 12 as electronic waste per state and local regulations. Customizing your Pen Your pen is supplied with 2 colored clip-on panels, so that you can customize the look of your pen. To remove the clip-on panel from your pen, insert the lip of the front cap into the groove under the front end of the panel, and pry the panel off. The new panel simply clicks into place ( See Figure AA ). Figure AA Caring for your Pen To clean your pen, wipe the outside surface with a damp cloth. Do not put the pen in water as this may damage your pen. Do not use alcohol or any other cleaning agents to clean the pen, as they may damage the plastic body. To clean the needle guard, wipe it with a damp cloth or alcohol pad. Questions and Answers Question Answer How long is the use period of my pen? The pen has a use period of 2 years starting from the first use by the patient. How can I tell how much GENOTROPIN is left in my pen? The indicative scale along the side of the cartridge window is a guide. The number that aligns with the front edge of the rubber stopper shows you how many milligrams are left in the cartridge. If your cartridge is nearly empty you can also dial the injection button until it cannot go any further, the dose display will then show the maximum dose that can be delivered. When the cartridge is empty, the injection button will not turn any further. If the display does not work, can my pen still be used? Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible to get a new pen. What happens if I dial the injection button beyond the maximum dose ('4.0' mg)? Some liquid may appear from the needle tip, and the numbers may disappear from the dose display. This is normal and will not affect your injection. To correct this, turn the injection button in the opposite direction of the arrow until numbers reappear on the dose display. Then dial back to your correct dose. Why is it difficult to turn or push the injection button? The injection button may become difficult to turn or to push. This may occur if the pen gets dirty due to contact with food, liquids or GENOTROPIN, or if the needle becomes clogged. Contact your healthcare provider if the issue does not resolve. Display Information Steady The selected dose size. The number indicates the dose size (in mg) that your pen will deliver if the injection button is fully pressed in. Steady A dose is not set.
