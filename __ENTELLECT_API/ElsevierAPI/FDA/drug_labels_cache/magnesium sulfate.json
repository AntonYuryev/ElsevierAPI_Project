Visually inspect Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer unless solution is clear and colorless to slightly yellow. \u2022 For intravenous use only \u2022 Administered via intravenous infusion pump Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection does not require dilution prior to intravenous administration. After removing the overwrap, check for minute leaks by squeezing the container fully. Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection if there is a leak or there is greater than 2 mL of water in the overwrap [see Description (11) ]. Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with incompatible drugs through the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in series connections. 2.2 Recommended Dosage \u2022 The recommended loading dosage of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients with eclampsia or preeclampsia is 4 to 6 grams over 15 minutes followed by a recommended maintenance dosage of 1 to 2 grams every hour. \u2022 Obtain serum magnesium concentrations and assess clinical status to adjust the dosage. \u2022 In patients with eclampsia, consider targeting the maintenance dosage to achieve serum magnesium concentrations of 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). For patients with recurrent eclampsia, consider giving an additional 2 gram intravenous bolus. \u2022 For patients with eclampsia, therapy should continue until seizures cease. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 30 to 40 grams of magnesium sulfate over 24 hours. \u2022 Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment and/or Oliguria \u2022 In patients with severe renal impairment and/or a urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, initiate Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with a 4 gram loading dose followed by a maintenance dosage of 1 gram every hour. \u2022 Titrate the magnesium sulfate maintenance dosage to maintain concentrations in the target range through frequent monitoring of magnesium concentrations and observation for clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (e.g., facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression).

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fetal-neonatal toxicity with prolonged use : Administration beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended and can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Risk of magnesium toxicity : Monitor magnesium concentrations and clinical signs of magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, an injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract hazards, for significant toxicity stop Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of elevated blood glucose: Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Co-administration with unapproved tocolytics : Do not use concomitantly with beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline and calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Aluminum toxicity : Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis : Use is contraindicated because use in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Fetal-Neonatal Toxicity with Prolonged Use Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days in pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus, including skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. Neonates of women receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (especially with prolonged maternal use) are at risk for magnesium toxicity including hyporeflexia, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. There is one reported case of neonatal death as the result of magnesium toxicity after transplacental exposure. The shortest duration of magnesium sulfate treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended. 5.2 Risk of Magnesium Toxicity Patients receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection are at risk for magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, acute renal failure and rarely, pulmonary edema. Monitor clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (for example, facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression) and magnesium concentrations during infusions of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more per minute). Serum magnesium concentrations usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium concentrations exceed 4 mEq per liter. Reflexes may be absent at concentration of 10 mEq per liter, at which point respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. If there is significant magnesium toxicity, stop the Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection infusion and recheck serum magnesium concentration. Patients with renal impairment are at greater risk of magnesium toxicity because magnesium is excreted by the body solely by the kidneys [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL per 4 hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in patients with preeclampsia. Discontinuation of the magnesium infusion is recommended when urine output is less than 100 mL every 4 hours to avoid magnesium toxicity, especially if serum creatinine is increasing progressively. 5.3 Risk of Elevated Blood Glucose Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus given the risk of elevated blood glucose. 5.4 Co-administration with Unapproved Tocolytics Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with unapproved tocolytics (e.g., beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline, or with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine). Serious adverse events including pulmonary edema and hypotension have occurred [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.5 Aluminum Toxicity Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains less than 25 mcg/L of aluminum). Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment who receive parenteral concentrations of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at concentrations associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. 5.6 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis. Use of magnesium sulfate in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by neuromuscular respiratory failure. Symptoms of myasthenic crisis may include difficulty swallowing, ptosis, facial droop, weakness and/or difficulty breathing that may require intubation. If myasthenic crisis is suspected, discontinue use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately. Secure the patient's airway. Consider intensive care unit admission and elective intubation, if respiratory failure is anticipated. Once the airway is secure, confirm the diagnosis. Therapies include plasmapheresis and plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunomodulating therapy in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose in water for injection for intravenous use. Each 100 mL contains 1 gram of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose, hydrous 5 grams in water for injection [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically known as sulfuric acid magnesium salt (1:1), heptahydrate and chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2219 7H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47. It occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. The molecular formula is C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2219 H 2 O and the molecular weight is 198.17. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. Water can permeate from inside the flexible plastic container into the overwrap [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Magnesium prevents seizures in patients with preeclampsia and controls seizures in patients with eclampsia by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium has a depressant effect on the central nervous system [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics With intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. The estimated magnesium concentration (above baseline) required to elicit half-maximum effect (EC 50 ) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with preeclampsia that received intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was reported to be 1.5 and 1.8 mEq per liter (1.9 and 2.2 mg per dL), respectively, in a published study. Effective anticonvulsant serum concentrations range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq per liter. Drug Interaction Studies The following information is based upon published case reports and clinical studies that could not be confirmed by an adequately controlled study, but still warrant consideration given the potential risks involved [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Neuromuscular Blocking Agents: Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade requiring modification of the neuromuscular blocking agent dosage and/or increased reversal agent requirements were reported in preeclamptic women who received magnesium sulfate treatment who underwent subsequent surgery (for example, caesarian section) with anesthesia that included either a depolarizing (d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine) or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (vecuronium, rocuronium). Narcotics and/or Propofol: Potentiation and prolongation of analgesic and/or sedative effects as well as a reduced requirement for an intravenous narcotic (fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol), intrathecal narcotic (fentanyl), and/or intravenous propofol was reported in magnesium sulfate treated patients who required surgery or intensive care that also included narcotic and/or propofol therapy. Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: An exaggerated hypotensive response (blood pressure 80\u201393/49\u201360 mm Hg) was reported in preeclamptic women who received oral nifedipine in addition to magnesium sulfate treatment. Blood pressure returned to previous levels within approximately 30 minutes with supportive care. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Elimination The average half-life and systemic clearance of magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic women is approximately 4 to 5 hours and 4 to 5 liters per hour, respectively. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment: Plasma magnesium concentrations of 7 to 12.3 mEq per liter (8.6 to 15.1 mg per dL) were reported in preeclamptic women with a urine output less than 100 mL per 4 hours that received 20 grams of magnesium sulfate intravenously over 2 to 8 hours in a published study [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fetal-neonatal toxicity with prolonged use : Administration beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended and can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities (2.2 , 5.1) \u2022 Risk of magnesium toxicity : Monitor magnesium concentrations and clinical signs of magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, an injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract hazards, for significant toxicity stop Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (5.2) \u2022 Risk of elevated blood glucose: Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus (5.3) \u2022 Co-administration with unapproved tocolytics : Do not use concomitantly with beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline and calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine (5.4) \u2022 Aluminum toxicity : Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment (5.5) \u2022 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis : Use is contraindicated because use in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis (5.6) 5.1 Fetal-Neonatal Toxicity with Prolonged Use Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days in pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus, including skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. Neonates of women receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (especially with prolonged maternal use) are at risk for magnesium toxicity including hyporeflexia, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. There is one reported case of neonatal death as the result of magnesium toxicity after transplacental exposure. The shortest duration of magnesium sulfate treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended. 5.2 Risk of Magnesium Toxicity Patients receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection are at risk for magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, acute renal failure and rarely, pulmonary edema. Monitor clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (for example, facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression) and magnesium concentrations during infusions of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more per minute). Serum magnesium concentrations usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium concentrations exceed 4 mEq per liter. Reflexes may be absent at concentration of 10 mEq per liter, at which point respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. If there is significant magnesium toxicity, stop the Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection infusion and recheck serum magnesium concentration. Patients with renal impairment are at greater risk of magnesium toxicity because magnesium is excreted by the body solely by the kidneys [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL per 4 hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in patients with preeclampsia. Discontinuation of the magnesium infusion is recommended when urine output is less than 100 mL every 4 hours to avoid magnesium toxicity, especially if serum creatinine is increasing progressively. 5.3 Risk of Elevated Blood Glucose Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus given the risk of elevated blood glucose. 5.4 Co-administration with Unapproved Tocolytics Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with unapproved tocolytics (e.g., beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline, or with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine). Serious adverse events including pulmonary edema and hypotension have occurred [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.5 Aluminum Toxicity Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains less than 25 mcg/L of aluminum). Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment who receive parenteral concentrations of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at concentrations associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. 5.6 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis. Use of magnesium sulfate in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by neuromuscular respiratory failure. Symptoms of myasthenic crisis may include difficulty swallowing, ptosis, facial droop, weakness and/or difficulty breathing that may require intubation. If myasthenic crisis is suspected, discontinue use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately. Secure the patient\u2019s airway. Consider intensive care unit admission and elective intubation, if respiratory failure is anticipated. Once the airway is secure, confirm the diagnosis. Therapies include plasmapheresis and plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunomodulating therapy in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 presents the potential clinical impact of medications that may be commonly administered concomitantly with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in the clinical setting. Table 1 : Potential Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection* Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clinical Impact: \u2022 Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade is possible with the concomitant use of magnesium sulfate and neuromuscular blocking agents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . \u2022 The underlying mechanism of this interaction may involve suppression of peripheral neuromuscular function by decreasing acetylcholine release, reduction of endplate sensitivity, and decreased muscle fiber excitability with magnesium sulfate therapy. Intervention: \u2022 Monitor respiration and the depth of neuromuscular blockade frequently (e.g., train-of-four monitoring) when a neuromuscular blocking agent is used concomitantly with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. \u2022 Adjust the dosage of the neuromuscular blocking agent accordingly to maintain the desired level of musculoskeletal activity. The amount of reversal agent(s) required to achieve adequate reversal of the neuromuscular blocking agent(s) may also be increased. Examples: \u2022 Depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: succinylcholine \u2022 Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, vecuronium Narcotics and/or Propofol Clinical Impact: \u2022 Potentiation and prolongation of analgesia and CNS depression is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with narcotics and/or propofol. The potential for magnesium sulfate to affect other CNS depressants is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . \u2022 The underlying mechanism of this interaction may involve antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) by magnesium sulfate therapy. Intervention: \u2022 Monitor the depth of CNS depression frequently using a reliable instrument. \u2022 Adjust the narcotic and/or propofol dosage accordingly to maintain the desired level of analgesia and sedation. Examples: \u2022 Narcotics and propofol Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers Clinical Impact: \u2022 An exaggerated hypotensive response is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. The potential for magnesium sulfate to affect other calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem and verapamil) is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Intervention: \u2022 Monitor vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiration) frequently. \u2022 Supportive care and/or discontinuation of the calcium channel blocker may be required. Examples: \u2022 Amlodipine, clevidipine, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, and nisoldipine Drugs that May Induce Magnesium Loss Clinical Impact: \u2022 Reduced magnesium concentrations may impact efficacy Intervention: \u2022 Monitor magnesium concentrations frequently and adjust the Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection dosage to maintain concentrations in the target range [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Examples: \u2022 Alcohol, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, cyclosporine, digitalis, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics *For drug incompatibility information [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . \u2022 Neuromuscular blocking agents : Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (7) \u2022 Narcotics and/or propofol : Potentiation and prolongation of analgesia and CNS depression is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (7) \u2022 Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers : An exaggerated hypotensive response is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (7) \u2022 Drugs that may induce magnesium loss with concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection : Alcohol, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, cyclosporine, digitalis, loop diuretics, and thiazide diuretics (7)"

Other signs and symptoms of magnesium overdosage include flushing, sweating, hypotension, weakness, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis, cardiac arrest, and prolongation of PR and QRS intervals. Patients with renal impairment and underlying neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis may experience magnesium intoxication at lower magnesium concentrations (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis). If patient is experiencing magnesium toxicity, immediately discontinue Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Artificial respiration may be required. Administer an injectable calcium salt to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Hypermagnesemia in the newborn (after administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection to the mother) may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose in water for injection for intravenous use. Each 100 mL contains 1 gram of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose, hydrous 5 grams in water for injection [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)] . Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically known as sulfuric acid magnesium salt (1:1), heptahydrate and chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47. It occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. The molecular formula is C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2022 H 2 O and the molecular weight is 198.17. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. Water can permeate from inside the Baxter VIAFLO flexible plastic container [composed of Polypropylene (PP), Polyamide (PA) and Polyethylene (PE)] into the overwrap [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. Dextrose Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Magnesium prevents seizures in patients with preeclampsia and controls seizures in patients with eclampsia by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium has a depressant effect on the central nervous system [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics With intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. The estimated magnesium concentration (above baseline) required to elicit half-maximum effect (EC 50 ) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with preeclampsia that received intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was reported to be 1.5 and 1.8 mEq per liter (1.9 and 2.2 mg per dL), respectively, in a published study. Effective anticonvulsant serum concentrations range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq per liter. Drug Interaction Studies The following information is based upon published case reports and clinical studies that could not be confirmed by an adequately controlled study, but still warrant consideration given the potential risks involved [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Neuromuscular Blocking Agents: Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade requiring modification of the neuromuscular blocking agent dosage and/or increased reversal agent requirements were reported in preeclamptic women who received magnesium sulfate treatment who underwent subsequent surgery (for example, caesarian section) with anesthesia that included either a depolarizing (d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine) or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (vecuronium, rocuronium). Narcotics and/or Propofol: Potentiation and prolongation of analgesic and/or sedative effects as well as a reduced requirement for an intravenous narcotic (fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol), intrathecal narcotic (fentanyl), and/or intravenous propofol was reported in magnesium sulfate treated patients who required surgery or intensive care that also included narcotic and/or propofol therapy. Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: An exaggerated hypotensive response (blood pressure 80-93/49-60 mm Hg) was reported in preeclamptic women who received oral nifedipine in addition to magnesium sulfate treatment. Blood pressure returned to previous levels within approximately 30 minutes with supportive care. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Elimination The average half-life and systemic clearance of magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic women is approximately 4 to 5 hours and 4 to 5 liters per hour, respectively. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment: Plasma magnesium concentrations of 7 to 12.3 mEq per liter (8.6 to 15.1 mg per dL) were reported in preeclamptic women with a urine output less than 100 mL per 4 hours that received 20 grams of magnesium sulfate intravenously over 2 to 8 hours in a published study [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias: Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Observe these patients during administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use with caution in these patients."

Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available data on the presence of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation.

In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults The colon cleansing efficacy of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. Water can permeate from inside the flexible plastic container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Cyclosporine Digitalis Alcohol Amphotericin B Diuretics Cisplatin"

      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy ( See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other l skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE . ) Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "Description Ansyr\u2122 Plastic Syringe Rx Only Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection, USP administered by the intravenous or intramuscular routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before intravenous use. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 5.5 to 7.0. The 50% concentration has an osmolarity of 4.06 mOsmol/mL (calc.). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated mgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O with molecular weight of 246.48 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. The plastic syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology Magnesium (Mg++) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/liter) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores are often not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/liter. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block may also occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Indications and Usage Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium (Mg++) level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/liter) and the serum calcium (Ca++) level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/liter) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures (convulsions) in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "Contraindications Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block and myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Warnings FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. Intravenous use in the eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to intravenous infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for intramuscular injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014 When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014 Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014 Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days.1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous intravenous infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (See OVERDOSAGE). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 grams in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "Adverse Reactions The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "Overdosage Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflect is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected intravenously to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both intravenous and intramuscular administration are appropriate. Intramuscular administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas intravenous doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of intravenous injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for intravenous infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep intramuscular injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 gram, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected intramuscularly every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given intramuscularly within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 grams, (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow intravenous infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In total parenteral nutrition, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 gram to 3 grams) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 gram to 1.25 grams) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 grams to 14 grams of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 grams to 5 grams in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, intramuscular doses of up to 10 gram (5 grams to 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial intravenous dose of 4 grams may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected intravenously over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 grams to 5 grams (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected intramuscularly into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 gram to 2 grams/hour by constant intravenous infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 grams to 40 grams should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other Uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 gram to 2 grams given intravenously. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 gram administered intramuscularly or intravenously. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 grams to 4 grams (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered intravenously over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 grams (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given intravenously. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Image1.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 mEq/liter to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 mEq/liter to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1% to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Cyclosporine Digitalis Alcohol Amphotericin B Diuretics Cisplatin"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 mEq/liter to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate in water for injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Magnesium sulfate in water for injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Teratogenic Effects: Magnesium sulfate in water for injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days 1 to 12 . Magnesium sulfate in water for injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous intravenous infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium sulfate in water for injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is administered to a nursing mother."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected intravenous to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 mL to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 mg to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 g to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium sulfate in water for injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of intravenous infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 g to 5 g (32.5 mEq to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 g/hour to 2 g/hour by constant intravenous infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 g to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 g to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, clear, colorless solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from polypropylene. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Cyclosporine Digitalis Alcohol Amphotericin B Diuretics Cisplatin"

When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralizations, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE . ) Labor and Delivery: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Cardiac arrhythmias: Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Contraindications (4) ]. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Observe these patients during administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use with caution in these patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was similar between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The sulfate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium contained in sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution were administered orally (gavage) to rats and dogs up to 28 days up to a maximum daily dose of 5 grams/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 3 times for rats and dogs, respectively, the recommended human dose of 44 grams/day or 0.89 grams/kg based on the body surface area). In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults The colon cleansing efficacy of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; Water for Injection q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Heavy metals Alkali carbonates and bicarbonates Hydrocortisone sodium succinate Alkali hydroxides Phosphates Arsenates Polymyxin B sulfate Barium Procaine hydrochloride Calcium Salicylates Clindamycin phosphate Strontium Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
      "In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity.",
      "In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily.",
      "In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities.",
      "Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV.",

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

      "OVERDOSAGE: Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Heavy metals Alkali carbonates and bicarbonates Hydrocortisone sodium succinate Alkali hydroxides Phosphates Arsenates Polymyxin B sulfate Barium Procaine hydrochloride Calcium Salicylates Clindamycin phosphate Strontium Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
      "In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period.

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( free flex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol",

      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate in water for injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with magnesium sulfate in water for injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D ( see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) . See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate in water for injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women.

If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate in water for injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in water for injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion.",

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer via intravenous infusion pump ( 2.1 ) Recommended loading dosage is 4 to 6 grams over 15 minutes followed by a recommended maintenance dosage of 1 to 2 grams every hour; maximum recommended dosage is 30 to 40 grams over 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Obtain serum magnesium concentrations and assess clinical status to adjust the dose ( 2.2 ) Administration beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) In patients with severe renal impairment and/or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, administer a 4 gram loading dose followed by a maintenance dosage of 1 gram every hour; do not exceed the maximum recommended dosage of 20 grams over 48 hours ( 2.3 ) Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with incompatible drugs through the same intravenous line, specifically with salicylates and alkali carbonates ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is: A clear solution. Visually inspect Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer unless solution is clear and colorless to slightly yellow. For intravenous use only Administered via intravenous infusion pump Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection does not require dilution prior to intravenous administration. Check for minute leaks by squeezing the container fully. Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection if there is a leak [see Description (11) ]. Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with incompatible drugs through the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in series connections. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended loading dosage of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients with eclampsia or preeclampsia is 4 to 6 grams over 15 minutes followed by a recommended maintenance dosage of 1 to 2 grams every hour. Obtain serum magnesium concentrations and assess clinical status to adjust the dosage. In patients with eclampsia, consider targeting the maintenance dosage to achieve serum magnesium concentrations of 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). For patients with recurrent eclampsia, consider giving an additional 2 gram intravenous bolus. For patients with eclampsia, therapy should continue until seizures cease. The maximum recommended dosage is 30 to 40 grams of magnesium sulfate over 24 hours. Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment and/or Oliguria In patients with severe renal impairment and/or a urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, initiate Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with a 4 gram loading dose followed by a maintenance dosage of 1 gram every hour. Titrate the magnesium sulfate maintenance dosage to maintain concentrations in the target range through frequent monitoring of magnesium concentrations and observation for clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (e.g., facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression). A lower maintenance dosage requirement is likely in these patients. Do not exceed the maximum recommended dosage of 20 grams of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection over 48 hours. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is not compatible with administration of a variety of solutions and forms precipitates of magnesium salts. Before using Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with another parenteral product, investigate potential incompatibilities. Incompatible products that should not be coadministered include salicylates and alkali carbonates."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fetal-neonatal toxicity with prolonged use : Administration beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended and can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Risk of magnesium toxicity : Monitor magnesium concentrations and clinical signs of magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, an injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract hazards, for significant toxicity stop Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection ( 5.2 ) Risk of elevated blood glucose: Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus ( 5.3 ) Co-administration with unapproved tocolytics : Do not use concomitantly with beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline and calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine ( 5.4 ) Aluminum toxicity : Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment ( 5.5 ) Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis : Use is contraindicated because use in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Fetal-Neonatal Toxicity with Prolonged Use Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days in pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus, including skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. Neonates of women receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (especially with prolonged maternal use) are at risk for magnesium toxicity including hyporeflexia, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. There is one reported case of neonatal death as the result of magnesium toxicity after transplacental exposure. The shortest duration of magnesium sulfate treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended. 5.2 Risk of Magnesium Toxicity Patients receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection are at risk for magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, acute renal failure and rarely, pulmonary edema. Monitor clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (for example, facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression) and magnesium concentrations during infusions of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more per minute). Serum magnesium concentrations usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium concentrations exceed 4 mEq per liter. Reflexes may be absent at concentration of 10 mEq per liter, at which point respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. If there is significant magnesium toxicity, stop the Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection infusion and recheck serum magnesium concentration. Patients with renal impairment are at greater risk of magnesium toxicity because magnesium is excreted by the body solely by the kidneys [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL per 4 hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in patients with preeclampsia. Discontinuation of the magnesium infusion is recommended when urine output is less than 100 mL every 4 hours to avoid magnesium toxicity, especially if serum creatinine is increasing progressively. 5.3 Risk of Elevated Blood Glucose Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus given the risk of elevated blood glucose. 5.4 Co-administration with Unapproved Tocolytics Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with unapproved tocolytics (e.g., beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline, or with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine). Serious adverse events including pulmonary edema and hypotension have occurred [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.5 Aluminum Toxicity Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains less than 25 mcg/L of aluminum). Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment who receive parenteral concentrations of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at concentrations associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. 5.6 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis. Use of magnesium sulfate in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by neuromuscular respiratory failure. Symptoms of myasthenic crisis may include difficulty swallowing, ptosis, facial droop, weakness and/or difficulty breathing that may require intubation. If myasthenic crisis is suspected, discontinue use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately. Secure the patient's airway. Consider intensive care unit admission and elective intubation, if respiratory failure is anticipated. Once the airway is secure, confirm the diagnosis. Therapies include plasmapheresis and plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunomodulating therapy in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 presents the potential clinical impact of medications that may be commonly administered concomitantly with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in the clinical setting. Table 1: Potential Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection For drug incompatibility information [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clinical Impact: Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade is possible with the concomitant use of magnesium sulfate and neuromuscular blocking agents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The underlying mechanism of this interaction may involve suppression of peripheral neuromuscular function by decreasing acetylcholine release, reduction of endplate sensitivity, and decreased muscle fiber excitability with magnesium sulfate therapy. Intervention: Monitor respiration and the depth of neuromuscular blockade frequently (e.g., train-of-four monitoring) when a neuromuscular blocking agent is used concomitantly with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Adjust the dosage of the neuromuscular blocking agent accordingly to maintain the desired level of musculoskeletal activity. The amount of reversal agent(s) required to achieve adequate reversal of the neuromuscular blocking agent(s) may also be increased. Examples: Depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: succinylcholine Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, vecuronium Narcotics and/or Propofol Clinical Impact: Potentiation and prolongation of analgesia and CNS depression is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with narcotics and/or propofol. The potential for magnesium sulfate to affect other CNS depressants is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The underlying mechanism of this interaction may involve antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) by magnesium sulfate therapy. Intervention: Monitor the depth of CNS depression frequently using a reliable instrument. Adjust the narcotic and/or propofol dosage accordingly to maintain the desired level of analgesia and sedation. Examples: Narcotics and propofol Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers Clinical Impact: An exaggerated hypotensive response is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. The potential for magnesium sulfate to affect other calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem and verapamil) is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Intervention: Monitor vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiration) frequently. Supportive care and/or discontinuation of the calcium channel blocker may be required. Examples: Amlodipine, clevidipine, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, and nisoldipine Drugs that May Induce Magnesium Loss Clinical Impact: Reduced magnesium concentrations may impact efficacy Intervention: Monitor magnesium concentrations frequently and adjust the Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection dosage to maintain concentrations in the target range [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Examples: Alcohol, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, cyclosporine, digitalis, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics Neuromuscular blocking agents : Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection ( 7 ) Narcotics and/or propofol : Potentiation and prolongation of analgesia and CNS depression is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection ( 7 ) Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers : An exaggerated hypotensive response is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection ( 7 ) Drugs that may induce magnesium loss with concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection : Alcohol, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, cyclosporine, digitalis, loop diuretics, and thiazide diuretics ( 7 )"

Other signs and symptoms of magnesium overdosage include flushing, sweating, hypotension, weakness, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis, cardiac arrest, and prolongation of PR and QRS intervals. Patients with renal impairment and underlying neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis may experience magnesium intoxication at lower magnesium concentrations (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis). If patient is experiencing magnesium toxicity, immediately discontinue Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Artificial respiration may be required. Administer an injectable calcium salt to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypermagnesemia in the newborn (after administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection to the mother) may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Magnesium prevents seizures in patients with preeclampsia and controls seizures in patients with eclampsia by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium has a depressant effect on the central nervous system [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics With intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. The estimated magnesium concentration (above baseline) required to elicit half-maximum effect (EC50) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with preeclampsia that received intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was reported to be 1.5 and 1.8 mEq per liter (1.9 and 2.2 mg per dL), respectively, in a published study. Effective anticonvulsant serum concentrations range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq per liter. Drug Interaction Studies The following information is based upon published case reports and clinical studies that could not be confirmed by an adequately controlled study, but still warrant consideration given the potential risks involved [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Neuromuscular Blocking Agents: Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade requiring modification of the neuromuscular blocking agent dosage and/or increased reversal agent requirements were reported in preeclamptic women who received magnesium sulfate treatment who underwent subsequent surgery (for example, caesarian section) with anesthesia that included either a depolarizing (d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine) or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (vecuronium, rocuronium). Narcotics and/or Propofol: Potentiation and prolongation of analgesic and/or sedative effects as well as a reduced requirement for an intravenous narcotic (fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol), intrathecal narcotic (fentanyl), and/or intravenous propofol was reported in magnesium sulfate treated patients who required surgery or intensive care that also included narcotic and/or propofol therapy. Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: An exaggerated hypotensive response (blood pressure 80\u201393/49\u201360 mm Hg) was reported in preeclamptic women who received oral nifedipine in addition to magnesium sulfate treatment. Blood pressure returned to previous levels within approximately 30 minutes with supportive care. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Elimination The average half-life and systemic clearance of magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic women is approximately 4 to 5 hours and 4 to 5 liters per hour, respectively. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment: Plasma magnesium concentrations of 7 to 12.3 mEq per liter (8.6 to 15.1 mg per dL) were reported in preeclamptic women with a urine output less than 100 mL per 4 hours that received 20 grams of magnesium sulfate intravenously over 2 to 8 hours in a published study [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias: Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis: Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. (5.8) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Observe these patients during administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use with caution in these patients. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, pruritus and urticaria have been reported with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was similar between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects."

In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults The colon cleansing efficacy of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep. Table 3: Proportion of Adult Patients with Successful Colon Cleansing Response Rates Treatment Group Regimen N Responders Responders were patients whose colon preparations were graded excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the colonoscopist. % (95% C.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stlres of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impuls. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but only larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized ot some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmakokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.2 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parental nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutriend admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration of kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immautre, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Thissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsion."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomegnesemia has been confirmed and the serium concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants -When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents - Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides - Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magenesium sulfate can cause fatal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal deminerlization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogencic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. the administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstretrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with sever impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. these include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and CNS depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute 1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyone 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For sever hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextros Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of dificiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenence requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20 % solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Image1.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2013When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2013Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2013Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."

In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution. For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV.

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; Water for Injection q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4,060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D ( See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

      "OVERDOSAGE: Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Heavy metals Alkali carbonates and bicarbonates Hydrocortisone sodium succinate Alkali hydroxides Phosphates Arsenates Polymyxin B sulfate Barium Procaine hydrochloride Calcium Salicylates Clindamycin phosphate Strontium Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
      "In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity.",
      "In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily.",
      "In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities.",
      "Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV.",

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible plastic container is free of polyvinylchloride. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Cyclosporine Digitalis Alcohol Amphotericin B Diuretics Cisplatin"

These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization's, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

      "Description Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection, USP administered by the intravenous or intramuscular routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before intravenous use. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 5.5 to 7.0. The 50% concentration has an osmolarity of 4.06 mOsmol/mL (calc.). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO4 \u2022 7H2O with molecular weight of 246.48 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. The plastic syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology Magnesium (Mg++) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/liter) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/liter. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Indications and Usage Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium (Mg++) level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/liter) and the serum calcium (Ca++) level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/liter) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures (convulsions) in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "Contraindications Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Warnings FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. Intravenous use in the eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to intravenous infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for intramuscular injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014 When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014 Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014 Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy (See Warnings and Precautions ) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days.1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous intravenous infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression ( See Overdosage ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 grams in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "Adverse Reactions The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "Overdosage Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected intravenously to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both intravenous and intramuscular administration are appropriate. Intramuscular administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas intravenous doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of intravenous injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for intravenous infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep intramuscular injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 gram, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected intramuscularly every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given intramuscularly within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 grams, (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow intravenous infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 gram to 3 grams) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 gram to 1.25 grams) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 grams to 14 grams of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 grams to 5 grams in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, intramuscular doses of up to 10 grams (5 grams or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial intravenous dose of 4 grams may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected intravenously over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 grams to 5 grams (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected intramuscularly into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 gram to 2 grams/hour by constant intravenous infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 grams to 40 grams should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other Uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 gram to 2 grams given intravenously. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 gram administered intramuscularly or intravenously. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 grams to 4 grams (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered intravenously over 30 seconds with extreme caution. For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 grams (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given intravenously. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high Heavy Metals concentrations) Hydrocortisone sodium Alkali carbonates and succinate bicarbonates Phosphates Alkali hydroxides Polymixin B sulfate Arsenates Procaine hydrochloride Barium Salicylates Calcium Strontium Clindamycin phosphate Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The single port bag is made of Nexcel M312A material, a 5-layer, polyolefin based on co-extrude film. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed Distribution Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE . ) Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion. Check the container for minute leaks by squeezing the inner bag firmly. If leaks are found, or if the seal is not intact, discard the solution, as the sterility may be compromised."

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; water for injection, q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4,060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2013When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2013Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2013Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Heavy metals Alkali carbonates and bicarbonates Hydrocortisone sodium succinate Alkali hydroxides Phosphates Arsenates Polymyxin B sulfate Barium Procaine hydrochloride Calcium Salicylates Clindamycin phosphate Strontium Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
      "In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity.",
      "In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily.",
      "In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function.

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO4 \u2022 7H2O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H2O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg++) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) Teratogenic Effects: Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other l skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days.1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE .) Labor and Delivery: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; Water for Injection q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE: Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer via intravenous infusion pump ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Recommended loading dosage is 4 to 6 grams over 15 minutes followed by a recommended maintenance dosage of 1 to 2 grams every hour; maximum recommended dosage is 30 to 40 grams over 24 hours ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Obtain serum magnesium concentrations and assess clinical status to adjust the dose ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Administration beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 In patients with severe renal impairment and/or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, administer a 4 gram loading dose followed by a maintenance dosage of 1 gram every hour; do not exceed the maximum recommended dosage of 20 grams over 48 hours ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with incompatible drugs through the same intravenous line, specifically with salicylates and alkali carbonates ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is: \u2022 A clear solution. Visually inspect Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer unless solution is clear and colorless to slightly yellow. \u2022 For intravenous use only \u2022 Administered via intravenous infusion pump Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection does not require dilution prior to intravenous administration. After removing the overwrap, check for minute leaks by squeezing the container fully. Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection if there is a leak or there is greater than 2 mL of water in the overwrap [see Description (11) ]. Do not administer Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with incompatible drugs through the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in series connections. 2.2 Recommended Dosage \u2022 The recommended loading dosage of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients with eclampsia or preeclampsia is 4 to 6 grams over 15 minutes followed by a recommended maintenance dosage of 1 to 2 grams every hour. \u2022 Obtain serum magnesium concentrations and assess clinical status to adjust the dosage. \u2022 In patients with eclampsia, consider targeting the maintenance dosage to achieve serum magnesium concentrations of 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). For patients with recurrent eclampsia, consider giving an additional 2 gram intravenous bolus. \u2022 For patients with eclampsia, therapy should continue until seizures cease. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 30 to 40 grams of magnesium sulfate over 24 hours. \u2022 Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.3 Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment and/or Oliguria \u2022 In patients with severe renal impairment and/or a urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, initiate Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with a 4 gram loading dose followed by a maintenance dosage of 1 gram every hour. \u2022 Titrate the magnesium sulfate maintenance dosage to maintain concentrations in the target range through frequent monitoring of magnesium concentrations and observation for clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (e.g., facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression). A lower maintenance dosage requirement is likely in these patients. \u2022 Do not exceed the maximum recommended dosage of 20 grams of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection over 48 hours. 2.4 Drug Incompatibilities Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is not compatible with administration of a variety of solutions and forms precipitates of magnesium salts.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fetal-neonatal toxicity with prolonged use : Administration beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended and can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Risk of magnesium toxicity : Monitor magnesium concentrations and clinical signs of magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, an injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract hazards, for significant toxicity stop Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of elevated blood glucose: Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Co-administration with unapproved tocolytics : Do not use concomitantly with beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline and calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Aluminum toxicity : Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis : Use is contraindicated because use in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Fetal-Neonatal Toxicity with Prolonged Use Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days in pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus, including skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. Neonates of women receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection (especially with prolonged maternal use) are at risk for magnesium toxicity including hyporeflexia, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. There is one reported case of neonatal death as the result of magnesium toxicity after transplacental exposure. The shortest duration of magnesium sulfate treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection beyond 5 to 7 days is not recommended. 5.2 Risk of Magnesium Toxicity Patients receiving Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection are at risk for magnesium toxicity including respiratory depression, acute renal failure and rarely, pulmonary edema. Monitor clinical signs of magnesium toxicity (for example, facial edema, diminished strength of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression) and magnesium concentrations during infusions of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more per minute). Serum magnesium concentrations usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg per 100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq per liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium concentrations exceed 4 mEq per liter. Reflexes may be absent at concentration of 10 mEq per liter, at which point respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. If there is significant magnesium toxicity, stop the Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection infusion and recheck serum magnesium concentration. Patients with renal impairment are at greater risk of magnesium toxicity because magnesium is excreted by the body solely by the kidneys [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL per 4 hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in patients with preeclampsia. Discontinuation of the magnesium infusion is recommended when urine output is less than 100 mL every 4 hours to avoid magnesium toxicity, especially if serum creatinine is increasing progressively. 5.3 Risk of Elevated Blood Glucose Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus given the risk of elevated blood glucose. 5.4 Co-administration with Unapproved Tocolytics Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with unapproved tocolytics (e.g., beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline, or with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine). Serious adverse events including pulmonary edema and hypotension have occurred [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.5 Aluminum Toxicity Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains less than 25 mcg/L of aluminum). Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment who receive parenteral concentrations of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at concentrations associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. 5.6 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis. Use of magnesium sulfate in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by neuromuscular respiratory failure. Symptoms of myasthenic crisis may include difficulty swallowing, ptosis, facial droop, weakness and/or difficulty breathing that may require intubation. If myasthenic crisis is suspected, discontinue use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately. Secure the patient's airway. Consider intensive care unit admission and elective intubation, if respiratory failure is anticipated. Once the airway is secure, confirm the diagnosis. Therapies include plasmapheresis and plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunomodulating therapy in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids."

Other signs and symptoms of magnesium overdosage include flushing, sweating, hypotension, weakness, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis, cardiac arrest, and prolongation of PR and QRS intervals. Patients with renal impairment and underlying neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis may experience magnesium intoxication at lower magnesium concentrations (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis). If patient is experiencing magnesium toxicity, immediately discontinue Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Artificial respiration may be required. Administer an injectable calcium salt to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypermagnesemia in the newborn (after administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection to the mother) may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose in water for injection for intravenous use. Each 100 mL contains 1 gram of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose, hydrous 5 grams in water for injection [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically known as sulfuric acid magnesium salt (1:1), heptahydrate and chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2219 7H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47. It occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. The molecular formula is C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2219 H 2 O and the molecular weight is 198.17. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. Water can permeate from inside the flexible plastic container (polyvinylchloride) into the overwrap [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Magnesium prevents seizures in patients with preeclampsia and controls seizures in patients with eclampsia by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium has a depressant effect on the central nervous system [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics With intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. The estimated magnesium concentration (above baseline) required to elicit half-maximum effect (EC 50 ) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with preeclampsia that received intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was reported to be 1.5 and 1.8 mEq per liter (1.9 and 2.2 mg per dL), respectively, in a published study. Effective anticonvulsant serum concentrations range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq per liter. Drug Interaction Studies The following information is based upon published case reports and clinical studies that could not be confirmed by an adequately controlled study, but still warrant consideration given the potential risks involved [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Neuromuscular Blocking Agents: Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade requiring modification of the neuromuscular blocking agent dosage and/or increased reversal agent requirements were reported in preeclamptic women who received magnesium sulfate treatment who underwent subsequent surgery (for example, caesarian section) with anesthesia that included either a depolarizing (d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine) or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (vecuronium, rocuronium). Narcotics and/or Propofol: Potentiation and prolongation of analgesic and/or sedative effects as well as a reduced requirement for an intravenous narcotic (fentanyl, sufentanil, tramadol), intrathecal narcotic (fentanyl), and/or intravenous propofol was reported in magnesium sulfate treated patients who required surgery or intensive care that also included narcotic and/or propofol therapy. Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: An exaggerated hypotensive response (blood pressure 80\u201393/49\u201360 mm Hg) was reported in preeclamptic women who received oral nifedipine in addition to magnesium sulfate treatment. Blood pressure returned to previous levels within approximately 30 minutes with supportive care. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Elimination The average half-life and systemic clearance of magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic women is approximately 4 to 5 hours and 4 to 5 liters per hour, respectively. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment: Plasma magnesium concentrations of 7 to 12.3 mEq per liter (8.6 to 15.1 mg per dL) were reported in preeclamptic women with a urine output less than 100 mL per 4 hours that received 20 grams of magnesium sulfate intravenously over 2 to 8 hours in a published study [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L.

      "PRECAUTIONS General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants\u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents\u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides\u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution. For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L.

      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution. For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( freeflex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate in water for injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with magnesium sulfate in water for injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) . See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate in water for injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-12 Magnesium sulfate in water for injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate in water for injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when magnesium sulfate in water for injection is administered to a nursing mother."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in water for injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM : Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous intravenous infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected intravenously to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-Eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of intravenous infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection. After the initial intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant intravenous infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum recommended dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate heptahydrate, USP is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol"

Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization's, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE. ) Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg per 100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate heptahydrate, USP is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol"

These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities.

      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia.

In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Cardiac arrhythmias: Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Contraindications (4) ]. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Observe these patients during administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use with caution in these patients."

Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available data on the presence of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution, administered as the recommended split-dose (2-day) regimen, were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was given as a one-day preparation (not a recommended regimen). Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation.

In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults The colon cleansing efficacy of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment\u2013 assess concurrent medications and consider testing in some patients ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) Patients with renal insufficiency\u2013 use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing ( 5.4 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation \u2013 rule out the diagnosis before administration ( 4 , 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration \u2013 observe during administration ( 5.7 ) Not for direct ingestion \u2013 dilute and take with additional water ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Patients with electrolyte abnormalities should have them corrected before treatment with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. In addition, use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment. [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. 5.4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution may increase these risks. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Such patients should be observed during administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. 5.8 Not for Direct Ingestion Each bottle must be diluted with water to a final volume of 16 ounces and ingestion of additional water as recommended is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undiluted solution may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22653%) are: overall discomfort, abdominal fullness, nausea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novel Laboratories, Inc. at 866-403-7592 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a multicenter, controlled clinical trial comparing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution with a bowel prep containing polyethylene glycol and electrolytes (PEG + E) that were administered in a split-dose (2-day) regimen, the most common adverse reactions after administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were overall discomfort, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache; see Table 1, below. Less common Adverse Reactions occurring were AV Block (1 case) and CK increase. In this study, patients receiving Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids; patients receiving the PEG + E bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids.

Higher rates of overall discomfort, abdominal distention, and nausea were observed with the evening-only (1-day) regimen compared to the split-dose (2-day) regimen for both preparations. Patients treated with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution had increased rates of vomiting with the evening-only (1-day) regimen. An evening-only (1-day) dosing regimen was associated with higher rates of abnormal values for some electrolytes when compared to the split-dose (2-day) regimen for both preparations. For Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution, the evening-only (1-day) regimen was associated with higher rates of total bilirubin (high), BUN (high), creatinine (high), osmolality (high), potassium (high) and uric acid (high) than the Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution split dose (2-day) regimen. Administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in an evening-only (1-day) dosing regimen is not recommended."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The osmotic effect of the unabsorbed ions, when ingested with a large volume of water, produces a copious watery diarrhea. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. After administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in six healthy volunteers, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (Tmax) was approximately 17 hours after the first half dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. The disposition of sulfate after Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was also studied in patients (N=6) with mild-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B) and in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). The renal impairment group had the highest serum sulfate AUC and C max , followed by the hepatic impairment group, and then by healthy subjects. Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and hepatic impairment patients. Renal impairment resulted in 54% higher mean AUC and 44% higher mean C max than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate levels of all three groups returned to their respective baseline levels by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours, starting after the first half dose, was similar between hepatic patients and normal volunteers, but was approximately 16% lower in moderate renal impairment patients than in healthy volunteers."

Studies to evaluate the possible impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution have not been performed. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The sulfate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium contained in Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were administered orally (gavage) to rats and dogs up to 28 days up to a maximum daily dose of 5 grams/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 3 times for rats and dogs, respectively, the recommended human dose of 44 grams/day or 0.89 grams/kg based on the body surface area). In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The colon cleansing efficacy of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study. In this study, 363 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel prep. In the Study Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was administered according to a split-dose preparation regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep. See Table 3 below. Table 3 : Colon Cleansing Response Rates Treatment Group Regimen N Responders 1 % ( 95 % C . I .)

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

      "OVERDOSAGE: Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV.

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; water for injection, q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4,060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO4\u20227H2O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants\u2013When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents\u2013Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides\u2013Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days.1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution. For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Heavy metals Alkali carbonates and bicarbonates Hydrocortisone sodium succinate Alkali hydroxides Phosphates Arsenates Polymyxin B sulfate Barium Procaine hydrochloride Calcium Salicylates Clindamycin phosphate Strontium Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

It has the following structural formula: C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2022 H 2 O M.W. 198.17 Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( free flex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. structure"

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women.

If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities.

      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 7.5 mL of a 2% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained, and the maximum recommended dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment\u2013 assess concurrent medications and consider testing in some patients ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) Patients with renal insufficiency\u2013 use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing ( 5.4 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation \u2013 rule out the diagnosis before administration ( 4 , 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration \u2013 observe during administration ( 5.7 ) Not for direct ingestion \u2013 dilute and take with additional water ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Patients with electrolyte abnormalities should have them corrected before treatment with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. In addition, use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment. [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. 5.4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution may increase these risks. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Such patients should be observed during administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. 5.8 Not for Direct Ingestion Each bottle must be diluted with water to a final volume of 16 ounces and ingestion of additional water as recommended is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undiluted solution may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances."

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. It is also not known whether Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 375 patients who received Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in clinical trials, 94 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 25 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution administered as a split-dose (2-day) regimen were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was given as a one-day preparation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The osmotic effect of the unabsorbed ions, when ingested with a large volume of water, produces a copious watery diarrhea. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. After administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in six healthy volunteers, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (Tmax) was approximately 17 hours after the first half dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. The disposition of sulfate after Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was also studied in patients (N=6) with mild-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B) and in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). The renal impairment group had the highest serum sulfate AUC and C max , followed by the hepatic impairment group, and then by healthy subjects. Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and hepatic impairment patients. Renal impairment resulted in 54% higher mean AUC and 44% higher mean C max than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate levels of all three groups returned to their respective baseline levels by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours, starting after the first half dose, was similar between hepatic patients and normal volunteers, but was approximately 16% lower in moderate renal impairment patients than in healthy volunteers."

Studies to evaluate the possible impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution have not been performed. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The sulfate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium contained in Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were administered orally (gavage) to rats and dogs up to 28 days up to a maximum daily dose of 5 grams/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 3 times for rats and dogs, respectively, the recommended human dose of 44 grams/day or 0.89 grams/kg based on the body surface area). In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The colon cleansing efficacy of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study. In this study, 363 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel prep. In the Study Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was administered according to a split-dose preparation regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. (5.1, 7.1) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. (5.2) Seizures : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. (5.3, 7.1) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. (5.4, 7.1) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out the diagnosis before administration. (4, 5.6) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. (5.7) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid. [ See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. [see Contraindications (4)]. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Observe these patients during administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use with caution in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that increase risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. (7.1) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients taking medications that increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4)]. 7.2 Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Administer oral medications at least one hour before starting each dose of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Administer tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to avoid chelation with magnesium. 7.3 Stimulant Laxatives Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available data on the presence of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in this age group is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14)] . In the pediatric trial, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses). Therefore, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . The safety profile of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The safety and effectiveness of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 375 patients who received sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in clinical trials, 94 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 25 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution administered as the recommended split-dose (2-day) regimen were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was given as a one-day preparation (not a recommended regimen). Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] ."

The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B).

In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults The colon cleansing efficacy of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was evaluated in a randomized, single- blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep. Table 3: Proportion of Adult Patients with Successful Colon Cleansing Response Rates 1 Responders were patients whose colon preparations were graded excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the colonoscopist. 2 Does not equal difference in tabled responder rates due to rounding effects.

The majority of patients were female (57%), white (78%), and of non-Hispanic or non-Latino ethnicity (91%). The mean age was 14 years. The median body weight was 60 kg (range 32 to 155 kg). Patients were randomized to sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 6-ounce doses), sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) or oral PEG solution. sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses); therefore, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Patients in the sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) group took the preparation in a \"split-dose\" regimen, where the first dose was taken the evening before colonoscopy, with the second dose taken the morning of the exam. Patients in the control group took the preparation according to its approved labeling on the evening before colonoscopy. Patients in the sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution group (two 4.5-ounce doses) were allowed to have a light breakfast on the day before colonoscopy, followed by clear liquids until the colonoscopy is completed the following day. Patients in the control group subjects were permitted only clear liquids on the day prior to colonoscopy until completion of the colonoscopy the following day. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received. The percentage of responders and the associated 95% confidence intervals for the sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) and Oral PEG solution are shown in Table 4. Efficacy was similar between patients who weighed 65 kg or more (n=12) and those patients who weighed less than 65 kg (n=15) in the sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) arm. Table 4: Proportion of Pediatric Patients 12 Years to 16 Years of Age with Successful Colon Cleansing Response Rates 1 Responders were patients whose colon preparations were graded excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the colonoscopist. 2 Does not equal difference in tabled responder rates due to rounding effects.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection, USP administered by the intravenous or intramuscular routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before intravenous use. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 5.5 to 7.0. The 50% concentration has an osmolarity of 4.06 mOsmol/mL (calc.). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O with molecular weight of 246.48 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. The plastic syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/liter) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/liter. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium (Mg ++ ) level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/liter) and the serum calcium (Ca ++ ) level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/liter) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures (convulsions) in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. Intravenous use in the eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to intravenous infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for intramuscular injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014 When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014 Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014 Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Teratogenic Effects Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous intravenous infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (See OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 grams in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse effects of parenterally administered magnesium usually are the result of magnesium intoxication. These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected intravenously to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both intravenous and intramuscular administration are appropriate. Intramuscular administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas intravenous doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of intravenous injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for intravenous infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep intramuscular injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 gram, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected intramuscularly every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given intramuscularly within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 grams, (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow intravenous infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 gram to 3 grams) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 gram to 1.25 grams) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 grams to 14 grams of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 grams to 5 grams in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, intramuscular doses of up to 10 grams (5 grams or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial intravenous dose of 4 grams may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected intravenously over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 grams to 5 grams (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected intramuscularly into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 gram to 2 grams/hour by constant intravenous infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 grams to 40 grams should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other Uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 gram to 2 grams given intravenously. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 gram administered intramuscularly or intravenously. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 grams to 4 grams (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered intravenously over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 grams (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given intravenously. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high Heavy Metals concentrations) Hydrocortisone sodium Alkali carbonates and succinate bicarbonates Phosphates Alkali hydroxides Polymixin B sulfate Arsenates Procaine hydrochloride Barium Salicylates Calcium Strontium Clindamycin phosphate Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection, USP administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; Water for Injection q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is 6.0 (5.5 to 7.0). The 50% concentration has an osmolarity of 4.06 mOsmol/mL (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous and 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Fetal Harm Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Aluminum Toxicity This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur even at lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014 When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014 Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014 Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients."

      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g, (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other Uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Hydrocortisone sodium Alkali carbonates and succinate bicarbonates Phosphates Alkali hydroxides Polymixin B sulfate Arsenates Procaine hydrochloride Barium Salicylates Calcium Strontium Clindamycin phosphate Tartrates Heavy Metals The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; Water for Injection q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4,060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV.

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP 50% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in Water for Injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. Must be diluted before IV use. Each mL contains: Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 500 mg; Water for Injection q.s. Sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. The pH of a 5% solution is between 5.5 and 7.0. (Osmolarity: 4060 mOsmol/L (calc.); 2.03 mM/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous; 4.06 mEq/mL magnesium sulfate anhydrous). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended only for use as a single dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded with the entire unit. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u20227H 2 O, with a molecular weight of 246.47 and occurs as colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Early symptoms of hypomagnesemia (less than 1.5 mEq/L) may develop as early as three to four days or within weeks. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end-plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), but it does not adversely affect the woman, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal plasma magnesium levels range from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. As plasma magnesium rises above 4 mEq/L, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the plasma level approaches 10 mEq/L. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower plasma levels of magnesium. Serum magnesium concentrations in excess of 12 mEq/L may be fatal. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by IV administration of calcium. Pharmacokinetics With IV administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following IM administration, the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.",

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP is suitable for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those observed in hypocalcemia. In such cases, the serum magnesium level is usually below the lower limit of normal (1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L) and the serum calcium level is normal (4.3 to 5.3 mEq/L) or elevated. In total parenteral nutrition (TPN), magnesium sulfate may be added to the nutrient admixture to correct or prevent hypomagnesemia which can arise during the course of therapy. Magnesium sulfate injection is also indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in a pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Parenteral administration of the drug is contraindicated in patients with heart block or myocardial damage."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. ALUMINUM TOXICITY: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication. IV use in eclampsia should be reserved for immediate control of life-threatening convulsions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Administer with caution if flushing and sweating occurs. When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics) are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL or more during the four hours preceding each dose. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/min). When repeated doses of the drug are given parenterally, knee jerk reflexes should be tested before each dose and if they are absent, no additional magnesium should be given until they return. Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/L). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/L. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/L, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate injection (50%) must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to IV infusion. Rate of administration should be slow and cautious, to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. The 50% solution also should be diluted to 20% or less for IM injection in infants and children. Laboratory Tests Magnesium sulfate injection should not be given unless hypomagnesemia has been confirmed and the serum concentration of magnesium is monitored. The normal serum level is 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2014When barbiturates, narcotics or other hypnotics (or systemic anesthetics), or other CNS depressants are to be given in conjunction with magnesium, their dosage should be adjusted with caution because of additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium. CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents \u2014Excessive neuromuscular block has occurred in patients receiving parenteral magnesium sulfate and a neuromuscular blocking agent; these drugs should be administered concomitantly with caution. Cardiac Glycosides \u2014Magnesium sulfate should be administered with extreme caution in digitalized patients, because serious changes in cardiac conduction which can result in heart block may occur if administration of calcium is required to treat magnesium toxicity. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium sulfate can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-10 Magnesium sulfate injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers Since magnesium is distributed into milk during parenteral magnesium sulfate administration, the drug should be used with caution in nursing women. Geriatrics Geriatric patients often require reduced dosage because of impaired renal function. In patients with severe impairment, dosage should not exceed 20 g in 48 hours. Serum magnesium should be monitored in such patients.",

      "OVERDOSAGE: Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained. Both IV and IM administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels in 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures (see below). Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate injection in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults, but the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children. In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity. In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. Intravenously, a dose of 4 to 5 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be infused. Simultaneously, IM doses of up to 10 g (5 g or 10 mL of the undiluted 50% solution in each buttock) are given. Alternatively, the initial IV dose of 4 g may be given by diluting the 50% solution to a 10 or 20% concentration; the diluted fluid (40 mL of a 10% solution or 20 mL of a 20% solution) may then be injected IV over a period of three to four minutes. Subsequently, 4 to 5 g (8 to 10 mL of the 50% solution) are injected IM into alternate buttocks every four hours as needed, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex and adequate respiratory function. Alternatively, after the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 grams/48 hours and frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained. Continuous use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. Other uses In counteracting the muscle-stimulating effects of barium poisoning, the usual dose of magnesium sulfate is 1 to 2 g given IV. For controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis or hypothyroidism, the usual adult dose is 1 g administered IM or IV. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, magnesium should be used only if simpler measures have failed and there is no evidence of myocardial damage. The usual dose is 3 to 4 g (30 to 40 mL of a 10% solution) administered IV over 30 seconds with extreme caution . For reduction of cerebral edema, 2.5 g (25 mL of a 10% solution) is given IV. Incompatibilities Magnesium sulfate in solution may result in a precipitate formation when mixed with solutions containing: Alcohol (in high concentrations) Heavy metals Alkali carbonates and bicarbonates Hydrocortisone sodium succinate Alkali hydroxides Phosphates Arsenates Polymyxin B sulfate Barium Procaine hydrochloride Calcium Salicylates Clindamycin phosphate Strontium Tartrates The potential incompatibility will often be influenced by the changes in the concentration of reactants and the pH of the solutions. It has been reported that magnesium may reduce the antibiotic activity of streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin when given together. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
      "In Magnesium Deficiency In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses (equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours). For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary. Alternatively, 5 g (approximately 40 mEq) can be added to one liter of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for slow IV infusion over a three-hour period. In the treatment of deficiency states, caution must be observed to prevent exceeding the renal excretory capacity.",
      "In Hyperalimentation In TPN, maintenance requirements for magnesium are not precisely known. The maintenance dose used in adults ranges from 8 to 24 mEq (1 to 3 g) daily; for infants, the range is 2 to 10 mEq (0.25 to 1.25 g) daily.",
      "In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate.

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in a 3%, 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium Sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. VIAFLO container is a flexible plastic container fabricated from a multilayer sheeting composed of Polypropylene (PP), Polyamide (PA) and Polyethylene (PE). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient's clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard.

Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected intravenously to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-Eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of intravenous infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection. After the initial intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant intravenous infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum recommended dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, USP is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) Teratogenic Effects: Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization\u2019s, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5 to 7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE. ) Labor and Delivery: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1-2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Cyclosporine Digitalis Alcohol Amphotericin B Diuretics Cisplatin"

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Intravenous magnesium should not be given to mothers with toxemia of pregnancy during the two hours preceding delivery."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5-7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection, can cause fetal abnormalities when administered beyond 5-7 days to pregnant women. There are retrospective epidemiological studies and case reports documenting fetal abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralizations, osteopenia and other skeletal abnormalities with continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for more than 5-7 days. 1-12 Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: When administered by continuous I.V. infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression. (See OVERDOSAGE . ) Labor and Delivery: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is administered to a nursing mother."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected I.V. to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as I.V. calcium."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) Seizures : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis: Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. (5.8) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Use Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Observe these patients during administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Use with caution in these patients. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions S erious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, pruritus and urticaria have been reported with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution to patients taking medications that increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )]. 7.2 Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Administer oral medications at least one hour before starting each dose of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Administer tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution to avoid chelation with magnesium. 7.3 Stimulant Laxatives Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available data on the presence of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in this age group is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In the pediatric trial, Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses). Therefore, Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . The safety profile of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 375 patients who received Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in clinical trials, 94 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 25 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution, administered as the recommended split-dose (2-day) regimen, were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was given as a one-day preparation (not a recommended regimen). Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after use of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in this age group is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In the pediatric trial, Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses). Therefore, Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . The safety profile of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] .

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Elimination After administration of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T max ) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. Excretion Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean C max was 44% higher, than healthy subjects. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C max ) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was similar between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults The colon cleansing efficacy of Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.

Pediatric Patients 12 Years to 16 Years of Age Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution was evaluated for colon cleansing in a randomized, single-blind, multicenter, dose-ranging, active-controlled study in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age. The majority of patients were female (57%), white (78%), and of non-Hispanic or non-Latino ethnicity (91%). The mean age was 14 years. The median body weight was 60 kg (range 32 to 155 kg). Patients were randomized to Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses), Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) or oral PEG solution. Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses); therefore, Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Patients in the Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) group took the preparation in a \u201csplit-dose\u201d regimen, where the first dose was taken the evening before colonoscopy, with the second dose taken the morning of the exam. Patients in the control group took the preparation according to its approved labeling on the evening before colonoscopy. Patients in the Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) group were allowed to have a light breakfast on the day before colonoscopy, followed by clear liquids until the colonoscopy is completed the following day. Patients in the control group subjects were permitted only clear liquids on the day prior to colonoscopy until completion of the colonoscopy the following day. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received. The percentage of responders and the associated 95% confidence intervals for the Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) and Oral PEG solution are shown in Table 4. Efficacy was similar between patients who weighed 65 kg or more (n=12) and those patients who weighed less than 65 kg (n=15) in the Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution (two 4.5-ounce doses) arm.

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose in water for injection. Each 100 mL contains 1 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose, hydrous 5 g in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in a 1% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage form and size. Magnesium sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2022 H 2 O M.W. 198.17 Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( free flex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol",

Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 7.5 mL of a 2% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained, and the maximum recommended dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion.",

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in 4% and 8% concentrations. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage forms and sizes. Magnesium sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( free flex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol",

      "For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in water for injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion.",
