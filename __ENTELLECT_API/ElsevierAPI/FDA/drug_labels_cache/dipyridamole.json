    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is believed that platelet reactivity and interaction with prosthetic cardiac valve surfaces, resulting in abnormally shortened platelet survival time, is a significant factor in thromboembolic complications occurring in connection with prosthetic heart valve replacement. Dipyridamole tablets have been found to lengthen abnormally shortened platelet survival time in a dose-dependent manner. In three randomized controlled clinical trials involving 854 patients who had undergone surgical placement of a prosthetic heart valve, dipyridamole tablets, in combination with warfarin, decreased the incidence of postoperative thromboembolic events by 62 to 91% compared to warfarin treatment alone. The incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving the combination of dipyridamole tablets and warfarin ranged from 1.2 to 1.8%. In three additional studies involving 392 patients taking dipyridamole tablets and coumarin-like anticoagulants, the incidence of thromboembolic events ranged from 2.3 to 6.9%. In these trials, the coumarin anticoagulant was begun between 24 hours and 4 days postoperatively, and the dipyridamole tablets were begun between 24 hours and 10 days postoperatively. The length of follow-up in these trials varied from 1 to 2 years. Dipyridamole tablets do not influence prothrombin time or activity measurements when administered with warfarin. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Hemodynamics In dogs intraduodenal doses of dipyridamole of 0.5 to 4.0 mg/kg produced dose-related decreases in systemic and coronary vascular resistance leading to decreases in systemic blood pressure and increases in coronary blood flow. Onset of action was in about 24 minutes and effects persisted for about 3 hours. Similar effects were observed following intravenous dipyridamole in doses ranging from 0.025 to 2.0 mg/kg. In man the same qualitative hemodynamic effects have been observed. However, acute intravenous administration of dipyridamole may worsen regional myocardial perfusion distal to partial occlusion of coronary arteries. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following an oral dose of dipyridamole tablets, the average time to peak concentration is about 75 minutes. The decline in plasma concentration following a dose of dipyridamole tablets fits a two-compartment model. The alpha half-life (the initial decline following peak concentration) is approximately 40 minutes. The beta half-life (the terminal decline in plasma concentration) is approximately 10 hours. Dipyridamole is highly bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized in the liver where it is conjugated as a glucuronide and excreted with the bile."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect and should be used with caution in patients with severe coronary artery disease (e.g., unstable angina or recently sustained myocardial infarction). Chest pain may be aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration. Hypotension Dipyridamole should be used with caution in patients with hypotension since it can produce peripheral vasodilation. Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with dipyridamole tablets who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt dipyridamole tablets for 48 hours prior to stress testing. Intake of dipyridamole tablets within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. Laboratory Tests Dipyridamole has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dipyridamole tablets. The following information was obtained from the literature. Adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: PREGNANCY CATEGORY B Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral dipyridamole doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1 1/2 , 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, dipyridamole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers As dipyridamole is excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when dipyridamole tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population below the age of 12 years have not been established."

In addition, angina pectoris has been reported rarely and there have been rare reports of liver dysfunction. On those uncommon occasions when adverse reactions have been persistent or intolerable, they have ceased on withdrawal of the medication. When dipyridamole tablets were administered concomitantly with warfarin, bleeding was no greater in frequency or severity than that observed when warfarin was administered alone. In rare cases, increased bleeding during or after surgery has been observed. In post-marketing reporting experience, there have been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, urticaria, severe bronchospasm, and angioedema), larynx edema, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthritis, nausea, dyspepsia, paresthesia, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, cholelithiasis, hypotension, palpitation, and tachycardia."

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose.

Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur . In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinicalexperience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intakeof aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications (4.1) ] Allergy [ see Contraindications (4.2) ] Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA, Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Body as a Whole: Hypothermia, chest pain, allergic reaction, syncope Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris, hypotension Central Nervous System: Cerebral edema, dizziness, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Fluid and Electrolyte: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis, gastritis, ulceration and perforation, hemorrhage rectum, melena, GI hemorrhage Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Hearing loss Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure, cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis, myalgia Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hypoglycemia, dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hematoma, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, purpura Psychiatric Disorders: Confusion, agitation Respiratory: Tachypnea, dyspnea, hemoptysis Skin and Appendages Disorders: Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma, pruritus, urticaria, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: Allergic vasculitis, flushing Other Adverse Events: Anorexia, aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin\u00ad dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data) . Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [ see Contraindications (4.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u00adguanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage (10) ] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bb z with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10) ] . Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole: In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3).

      "Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator described as 2,6 bis-(diethanolamino)-4,8 dipiperidino-pyrimido-(5,4-d) pyrimidine. The structural formula is: C24H40N8O4 MW 504.63 Dipyridamole Injection, USP is a sterile, odorless, pale yellow liquid which can be diluted in sodium chloride injection or dextrose injection for intravenous administration. Each mL contains 5 mg dipyridamole, USP, 50 mg polyethylene glycol 600 and 2 mg tartaric acid in Water for Injection, USP. pH 2.2-3.2; hydrochloric acid added for pH adjustment. Formula1.jpg"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology In a study of 10 patients with angiographically normal or minimally stenosed (less than 25% luminal diameter narrowing) coronary vessels, Dipyridamole Injection in a dose of 0.56 mg/kg infused over 4 minutes resulted in an average fivefold increase in coronary blood flow velocity compared to resting coronary flow velocity (range 3.8 to 7 times resting velocity). The mean time to peak flow velocity was 6.5 minutes from the start of the 4-minute infusion (range 2.5 to 8.7 minutes). Cardiovascular responses to the intravenous administration of Dipyridamole Injection when given to patients in the supine position include a mild but significant increase in heart rate of approximately 20% and mild but significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 2-8%, with vital signs returning to baseline values in approximately 30 minutes. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator in man. The mechanism of vasodilation has not been fully elucidated, but may result from inhibition of uptake of adenosine, an important mediator of coronary vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole are abolished by administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline. How dipyridamole-induced vasodilation leads to abnormalities in thallium distribution and ventricular function is also uncertain but presumably represents a \u201csteal\u201d phenomenon in which relatively intact vessels dilate and sustain enhanced flow, leaving reduced pressure and flow across areas of hemodynamically important coronary vascular constriction. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Plasma dipyridamole concentrations decline in a triexponential fashion following intravenous infusion of dipyridamole, with halflives averaging 3-12 minutes, 33-62 minutes and 11.6-15 hours. Two minutes following a 0.568 mg/kg dose of Dipyridamole Injection administered as a 4-minute infusion, the mean dipyridamole serum concentration is 4.6 \u00b1 1.3 mcg/mL. The average plasma protein binding of dipyridamole is approximately 99%, primarily toa1-glycoprotein. Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver to the glucuronic acid conjugate and excreted with the bile. The average total body clearance is 2.3-3.5 mL/min/kg, with an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1-2.5 L/kg and a central apparent volume of 3-5 liters."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Indications and Usage Dipyridamole Injection is indicated as an alternative to exercise in thallium myocardial perfusion imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately. In a study of about 1100 patients who underwent coronary arteriography and Dipyridamole Injection assisted thallium imaging, the results of both tests were interpreted blindly and the sensitivity and specificity of the dipyridamole thallium study in predicting the angiographic outcome were calculated. The sensitivity of the dipyridamole test (true positive dipyridamole divided by the total number of patients with positive angiography) was about 85%. The specificity (true negative divided by the number of patients with negative angiograms) was about 50%. In a subset of patients who had exercise thallium imaging as well as dipyridamole thallium imaging, sensitivity and specificity of the two tests were almost identical."

    "warnings": [
      "Warnings Serious adverse reactions associated with the administration of intravenous Dipyridamole Injection have included cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, seizures, anaphylactoid reaction and bronchospasm. There have been reported cases of asystole, sinus node arrest, sinus node depression and conduction block. Patients with abnormalities of cardiac impulse formation/conduction or severe coronary artery disease may be at increased risk for these events. In a study of 3911 patients given intravenous dipyridamole as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging, two types of serious adverse events were reported: 1. four cases of myocardial infarction (0.1%), two fatal (0.05%) and two non-fatal (0.05%) and 2. six cases of severe bronchospasm (0.2%). Although the incidence of these serious adverse events was small (0.3%, 10 of 3911), the potential clinical information to be gained through use of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE noting the rate of false positive and false negative results) must be weighed against the risk to the patient. Patients with a history of unstable angina may be at a greater risk for severe myocardial ischemia. Patients with a history of asthma may be at a greater risk for bronchospasm during Dipyridamole Injection use. When thallium myocardial perfusion imaging is performed with intravenous dipyridamole, parenteral aminophylline should be readily available for relieving adverse events such as bronchospasm or chest pain. Vital signs should be monitored during, and for 10-15 minutes following, the intravenous infusion of dipyridamole and an electrocardiographic tracing should be obtained using at least one chest lead. Should severe chest pain or bronchospasm occur, parenteral aminophylline may be administered by slow intravenous injection (50-100 mg over 30-60 seconds) in doses ranging from 50 to 250 mg. In the case of severe hypotension, the patient should be placed in a supine position with the head tilted down if necessary, before administration of parenteral aminophylline. If 250 mg of aminophylline does not relieve chest pain symptoms within a few minutes, sublingual nitroglycerin may be administered. If chest pain continues despite use of aminophylline and nitroglycerin, the possibility of myocardial infarction should be considered. If the clinical condition of a patient with an adverse event permits a one-minute delay in the administration of parenteral aminophylline, thallium-201 may be injected and allowed to circulate for one minute before the injection of aminophylline. This will allow initial thallium perfusion imaging to be performed before reversal of the pharmacologic effects of dipyridamole on the coronary circulation."

      "Precautions See WARNINGS . Drug Interactions Oral maintenance theophylline and other xanthine derivatives such as caffeine may abolish the coronary vasodilatation induced by intravenous Dipyridamole Injection administration. This could lead to a false negative thallium imaging result (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u2013 Mechanism of Action). Myasthenia gravis patients receiving therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors may experience worsening of their disease in the presence of dipyridamole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed at doses of up to 75 mg/kg/day (9.4 times1 the maximum recommended daily human oral dose) in mice (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females) and rats (up to 111 weeks in males and females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (63 times 1. the maximum recommended daily human oral dose). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg/day. 1Calculation based on assumed body weight of 50kg Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects \u2013 Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in mice and rats at daily oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg (15.6 times1 the maximum recommended daily human oral dose) and in rabbits at daily oral doses of up to 20 mg/kg (2.5 times1 the maximum recommended daily human oral dose) have revealed no evidence of impaired embryonic development due to dipyridamole. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 1Calculation based on assumed body weight of 50kg Nursing Mothers Dipyridamole is excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration The dose of intravenous Dipyridamole Injection as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging should be adjusted according to the weight of the patient. The recommended dose is 0.142 mg/kg/min (0.57 mg/kg total) infused over 4 minutes. Although the maximum tolerated dose has not been determined, clinical experience suggests that a total dose beyond 60 mg is not needed for any patient. Prior to intravenous administration, Dipyridamole Injection should be diluted in at least a 1:2 ratio with sodium chloride injection 0.45%, sodium chloride injection 0.9% or dextrose injection 5% for a total volume of approximately 20 to 50 mL. Infusion of undiluted dipyridamole may cause local irritation. Thallium-201 should be injected within 5 minutes following the 4-minute infusion of dipyridamole. Do not mix Dipyridamole Injection with other drugs in the same syringe or infusion container. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding ( 5.1 ) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) Interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules 48 hours before using intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents for stress testing ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur . In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) ] Allergy [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ) ] Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Endo at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding ( 7.1 ) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. A nagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data) . Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u00ad-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bb z with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole: In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u00ad-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding. (5.1) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency. (5.2, 5.3) Interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules 48 hours before using intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents for stress testing. ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contain aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.",

      "5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension.",
      "5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1) ] Allergy [see Contraindications (4.2) ] Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6,602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. NOS = not otherwise specified. Discontinuation due to adverse events in ESPS2 was 25% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25% for extended-release dipyridamole, 19% for aspirin, and 21% for placebo (refer to Table 2).

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.

      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6,602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

Note: ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg. The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Figure 1 ESPS2: Cumulative Stroke Rate (Fatal or Nonfatal) Over 24 months of Follow-Up Combined Stroke or Death Endpoint In ESPS2, Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke or death by 24.2% compared to placebo. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke or death by 12.1% compared to aspirin alone and by 10.3% compared to extended-release dipyridamole alone. These results were not statistically significant. Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 11.3% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 11.0% for aspirin alone, 11.4% for extended-release dipyridamole alone and 12.3% for placebo alone. The differences between the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin alone and extended-release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant. These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients. 10"

Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data) . Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady-state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .",

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20% to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage (10) ] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bb z with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 g to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e. the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10) ] . Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole: In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20% to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state.

The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1,250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules 48 hours before using intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents for stress testing ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] \u2022 Allergy [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] \u2022 Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar RxLLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6,602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ] . Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications ( 4.3 ) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate < 10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ] . Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 grams. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Absorption Dipyridamole Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole When aspirin and dipyridamole extended-release capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbz with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 grams), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: Aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

Figure 1 ESPS2: Cumulative Stroke Rate (Fatal or Nonfatal) Over 24 months of Follow-Up Combined Stroke or Death Endpoint In ESPS2, aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke or death by 24.2% compared to placebo. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke or death by 12.1% compared to aspirin alone and by 10.3% compared to extended-release dipyridamole alone. These results were not statistically significant. Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 11.3% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, 11% for aspirin alone, 11.4% for extended-release dipyridamole alone and 12.3% for placebo alone. The differences between the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin alone and extended-release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant. These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients."

Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [ see Drug Interaction (7.1) ]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contain aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see Use in specific Population ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in specific Population ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%."

The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Body as a Whole: Hypothermia, chest pain, allergic reaction, syncope Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris, hypotension Central Nervous System: Cerebral edema, dizziness, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Fluid and Electrolyte: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis, gastritis, ulceration and perforation, hemorrhage rectum, melena, GI hemorrhage Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Hearing loss Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure, cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis, myalgia Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hypoglycemia, dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hematoma, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, purpura Psychiatric Disorders : Confusion, agitation Respiratory : Tachypnea, dyspnea, hemoptysis Skin and Appendages Disorders : Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma, pruritus, urticaria, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) Urogenital : Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders : Allergic vasculitis, flushing Other Adverse Events: Anorexia, aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole ( see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3', 5\u2019- guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbz with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage ( 10 ).]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole: In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke or death by 12.1% compared to aspirin alone and by 10.3% compared to extended-release dipyridamole alone. These results were not statistically significant. Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 11.3% for Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, 11% for aspirin alone, 11.4% for extended-release dipyridamole alone and 12.3% for placebo alone. The differences between the Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin alone and extended-release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant. These incidence rates for Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients. Figure1.jpg"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding ( 5.1 ) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) Interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules 48 hours before using intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents for stress testing ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur . In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications (4.1) ] Allergy [ see Contraindications (4.2) ] Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA, Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin\u00ad dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data) . Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [ see Contraindications (4.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u00adguanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage (10) ] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bb z with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10) ] . Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole: In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

Figure 1 ESPS2: Cumulative Stroke Rate (Fatal or Nonfatal) Over 24 months of Follow-Up Combined Stroke or Death Endpoint In ESPS2, aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule reduced the risk of stroke or death by 24.2% compared to placebo. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule reduced the risk of stroke or death by 12.1% compared to aspirin alone and by 10.3% compared to extended-release dipyridamole alone. These results were not statistically significant. Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 11.3% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 11% for aspirin alone, 11.4% for extended-release dipyridamole alone and 12.3% for placebo alone. The differences between the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin alone and extended-release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant. These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In a study of 10 patients with angiographically normal or minimally stenosed (less than 25% luminal diameter narrowing) coronary vessels, Dipyridamole Injection in a dose of 0.56 mg/kg infused over 4 minutes resulted in an average fivefold increase in coronary blood flow velocity compared to resting coronary flow velocity (range 3.8 to 7 times resting velocity). The mean time to peak flow velocity was 6.5 minutes from the start of the 4-minute infusion (range 2.5 to 8.7 minutes). Cardiovascular responses to the intravenous administration of Dipyridamole Injection when given to patients in the supine position include a mild but significant increase in heart rate of approximately 20% and mild but significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 2-8%, with vital signs returning to baseline values in approximately 30 minutes. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator in man. The mechanism of vasodilation has not been fully elucidated, but may result from inhibition of uptake of adenosine, an important mediator of coronary vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole are abolished by administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline. How dipyridamole-induced vasodilation leads to abnormalities in thallium distribution and ventricular function is also uncertain but presumably represents a \u201csteal\u201d phenomenon in which relatively intact vessels dilate and sustain enhanced flow, leaving reduced pressure and flow across areas of hemodynamically important coronary vascular constriction. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Plasma dipyridamole concentrations decline in a triexponential fashion following intravenous infusion of dipyridamole, with half-lives averaging 3-12 minutes, 33-62 minutes and 11.6-15 hours. Two minutes following a 0.568 mg/kg dose of Dipyridamole Injection administered as a 4-minute infusion, the mean dipyridamole serum concentration is 4.6 \u00b1 1.3 mcg/mL. The average plasma protein binding of dipyridamole is approximately 99%, primarily to \u03b1 1 -glycoprotein. Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver to the glucuronic acid conjugate and excreted with the bile. The average total body clearance is 2.3-3.5 mL/min/kg, with an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1-2.5 L/kg and a central apparent volume of 3-5 liters."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dipyridamole Injection is indicated as an alternative to exercise in thallium myocardial perfusion imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately. In a study of about 1100 patients who underwent coronary arteriography and Dipyridamole Injection assisted thallium imaging, the results of both tests were interpreted blindly and the sensitivity and specificity of the dipyridamole thallium study in predicting the angiographic outcome were calculated. The sensitivity of the dipyridamole test (true positive dipyridamole divided by the total number of patients with positive angiography) was about 85%. The specificity (true negative divided by the number of patients with negative angiograms) was about 50%. In a subset of patients who had exercise thallium imaging as well as dipyridamole thallium imaging, sensitivity and specificity of the two tests were almost identical."

      "WARNINGS Serious adverse reactions associated with the administration of intravenous Dipyridamole Injection have included cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, seizures, anaphylactoid reaction and bronchospasm. There have been reported cases of asystole, sinus node arrest, sinus node depression and conduction block. Patients with abnormalities of cardiac impulse formation/conduction or severe coronary artery disease may be at increased risk for these events. In a study of 3911 patients given intravenous dipyridamole as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging, two types of serious adverse events were reported: 1) four cases of myocardial infarction (0.1%), two fatal (0.05%) and two non-fatal (0.05%) and 2) six cases of severe bronchospasm (0.2%). Although the incidence of these serious adverse events was small (0.3%, 10 of 3911), the potential clinical information to be gained through use of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE noting the rate of false positive and false negative results) must be weighed against the risk to the patient. Patients with a history of unstable angina may be at a greater risk for severe myocardial ischemia. Patients with a history of asthma may be at a greater risk for bronchospasm during Dipyridamole Injection use. When thallium myocardial perfusion imaging is performed with intravenous dipyridamole, parenteral aminophylline should be readily available for relieving adverse events such as bronchospasm or chest pain. Vital signs should be monitored during, and for 10-15 minutes following, the intravenous infusion of dipyridamole and an electrocardiographic tracing should be obtained using at least one chest lead. Should severe chest pain or bronchospasm occur, parenteral aminophylline may be administered by slow intravenous injection (50-100 mg over 30-60 seconds) in doses ranging from 50 to 250 mg. In the case of severe hypotension, the patient should be placed in a supine position with the head tilted down if necessary, before administration of parenteral aminophylline. If 250 mg of aminophylline does not relieve chest pain symptoms within a few minutes, sublingual nitroglycerin may be administered. If chest pain continues despite use of aminophylline and nitroglycerin, the possibility of myocardial infarction should be considered. If the clinical condition of a patient with an adverse event permits a one-minute delay in the administration of parenteral aminophylline, thallium-201 may be injected and allowed to circulate for one minute before the injection of aminophylline. This will allow initial thallium perfusion imaging to be performed before reversal of the pharmacologic effects of dipyridamole on the coronary circulation."

Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6,602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications ( 4.3 ) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate < 10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 grams. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Absorption Dipyridamole Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbz with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 grams), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: Aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In a study of 10 patients with angiographically normal or minimally stenosed (less than 25% luminal diameter narrowing) coronary vessels, Dipyridamole Injection in a dose of 0.56 mg/kg infused over 4 minutes resulted in an average fivefold increase in coronary blood flow velocity compared to resting coronary flow velocity (range 3.8 to 7 times resting velocity). The mean time to peak flow velocity was 6.5 minutes from the start of the 4-minute infusion (range 2.5 to 8.7 minutes). Cardiovascular responses to the intravenous administration of Dipyridamole Injection when given to patients in the supine position include a mild but significant increase in heart rate of approximately 20% and mild but significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 2-8%, with vital signs returning to baseline values in approximately 30 minutes. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator in man. The mechanism of vasodilation has not been fully elucidated, but may result from inhibition of uptake of adenosine, an important mediator of coronary vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole are abolished by administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline. How dipyridamole-induced vasodilation leads to abnormalities in thallium distribution and ventricular function is also uncertain but presumably represents a \u201csteal\u201d phenomenon in which relatively intact vessels dilate and sustain enhanced flow, leaving reduced pressure and flow across areas of hemodynamically important coronary vascular constriction. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Plasma dipyridamole concentrations decline in a triexponential fashion following intravenous infusion of dipyridamole, with half-lives averaging 3-12 minutes, 33-62 minutes and 11.6-15 hours. Two minutes following a 0.568 mg/kg dose of Dipyridamole Injection administered as a 4-minute infusion, the mean dipyridamole serum concentration is 4.6 \u00b1 1.3 mcg/mL. The average plasma protein binding of dipyridamole is approximately 99%, primarily to \u03b11-glycoprotein. Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver to the glucuronic acid conjugate and excreted with the bile. The average total body clearance is 2.3-3.5 mL/min/kg, with an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1-2.5 L/kg and a central apparent volume of 3-5 liters."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Dipyridamole Injection is indicated as an alternative to exercise in thallium myocardial perfusion imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately. In a study of about 1100 patients who underwent coronary arteriography and Dipyridamole Injection assisted thallium imaging, the results of both tests were interpreted blindly and the sensitivity and specificity of the dipyridamole thallium study in predicting the angiographic outcome were calculated. The sensitivity of the dipyridamole test (true positive dipyridamole divided by the total number of patients with positive angiography) was about 85%. The specificity (true negative divided by the number of patients with negative angiograms) was about 50%. In a subset of patients who had exercise thallium imaging as well as dipyridamole thallium imaging, sensitivity and specificity of the two tests were almost identical."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serious adverse reactions associated with the administration of intravenous Dipyridamole Injection have included cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, seizures, anaphylactoid reaction and bronchospasm. There have been reported cases of asystole, sinus node arrest, sinus node depression and conduction block. Patients with abnormalities of cardiac impulse formation/conduction or severe coronary artery disease may be at increased risk for these events. In a study of 3911 patients given intravenous dipyridamole as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging, two types of serious adverse events were reported: 1) four cases of myocardial infarction (0.1%), two fatal (0.05%) and two non-fatal (0.05%) and 2) six cases of severe bronchospasm (0.2%). Although the incidence of these serious adverse events was small (0.3%, 10 of 3911), the potential clinical information to be gained through use of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE noting the rate of false positive and false negative results) must be weighed against the risk to the patient. Patients with a history of unstable angina may be at a greater risk for severe myocardial ischemia. Patients with a history of asthma may be at a greater risk for bronchospasm during Dipyridamole Injection use. When thallium myocardial perfusion imaging is performed with intravenous dipyridamole, parenteral aminophylline should be readily available for relieving adverse events such as bronchospasm or chest pain. Vital signs should be monitored during, and for 10-15 minutes following, the intravenous infusion of dipyridamole and an electrocardiographic tracing should be obtained using at least one chest lead. Should severe chest pain or bronchospasm occur, parenteral aminophylline may be administered by slow intravenous injection (50-100 mg over 30-60 seconds) in doses ranging from 50 to 250 mg. In the case of severe hypotension, the patient should be placed in a supine position with the head tilted down if necessary, before administration of parenteral aminophylline. If 250 mg of aminophylline does not relieve chest pain symptoms within a few minutes, sublingual nitroglycerin may be administered. If chest pain continues despite use of aminophylline and nitroglycerin, the possibility of myocardial infarction should be considered. If the clinical condition of a patient with an adverse event permits a one-minute delay in the administration of parenteral aminophylline, thallium-201 may be injected and allowed to circulate for one minute before the injection of aminophylline. This will allow initial thallium perfusion imaging to be performed before reversal of the pharmacologic effects of dipyridamole on the coronary circulation."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS See WARNINGS . Drug Interactions Oral maintenance theophylline and other xanthine derivatives such as caffeine may abolish the coronary vasodilatation induced by intravenous Dipyridamole Injection administration. This could lead to a false negative thallium imaging result (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u2013 Mechanism of Action). Myasthenia gravis patients receiving therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors may experience worsening of their disease in the presence of dipyridamole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed at doses of up to 75 mg/kg/day (9.4 times* the maximum recommended daily human oral dose) in mice (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females) and rats (up to 111 weeks in males and females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (63 times* the maximum recommended daily human oral dose). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg/day. * Calculation based on assumed body weight of 50 kg. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects \u2013 Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in mice and rats at daily oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg (15.6 times* the maximum recommended daily human oral dose) and in rabbits at daily oral doses of up to 20 mg/kg (2.5 times* the maximum recommended daily human oral dose) have revealed no evidence of impaired embryonic development due to dipyridamole. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. * Calculation based on assumed body weight of 50 kg. Nursing Mothers Dipyridamole is excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is believed that platelet reactivity and interaction with prosthetic cardiac valve surfaces, resulting in abnormally shortened platelet survival time, is a significant factor in thromboembolic complications occurring in connection with prosthetic heart valve replacement. Dipyridamole tablets have been found to lengthen abnormally shortened platelet survival time in a dose-dependent manner. In three randomized controlled clinical trials involving 854 patients who had undergone surgical placement of a prosthetic heart valve, dipyridamole tablets, in combination with warfarin, decreased the incidence of postoperative thromboembolic events by 62% to 91% compared to warfarin treatment alone. The incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving the combination of dipyridamole tablets and warfarin ranged from 1.2% to 1.8%. In three additional studies involving 392 patients taking dipyridamole tablets and coumarin-like anticoagulants, the incidence of thromboembolic events ranged from 2.3% to 6.9%. In these trials, the coumarin anticoagulant was begun between 24 hours and 4 days postoperatively, and the dipyridamole tablets were begun between 24 hours and 10 days postoperatively. The length of follow-up in these trials varied from 1 to 2 years. Dipyridamole tablets do not influence prothrombin time or activity measurements when administered with warfarin. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 mcg/mL to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Hemodynamics In dogs intraduodenal doses of dipyridamole of 0.5 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/kg produced dose-related decreases in systemic and coronary vascular resistance leading to decreases in systemic blood pressure and increases in coronary blood flow. Onset of action was in about 24 minutes and effects persisted for about 3 hours. Similar effects were observed following intravenous dipyridamole in doses ranging from 0.025 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg. In man the same qualitative hemodynamic effects have been observed. However, acute intravenous administration of dipyridamole may worsen regional myocardial perfusion distal to partial occlusion of coronary arteries. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following an oral dose of dipyridamole tablets, the average time to peak concentration is about 75 minutes. The decline in plasma concentration following a dose of dipyridamole tablets fits a two-compartment model. The alpha half-life (the initial decline following peak concentration) is approximately 40 minutes. The beta half-life (the terminal decline in plasma concentration) is approximately 10 hours. Dipyridamole is highly bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized in the liver where it is conjugated as a glucuronide and excreted with the bile."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Coronary Artery Disease: Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect and should be used with caution in patients with severe coronary artery disease (e.g., unstable angina or recently sustained myocardial infarction). Chest pain may be aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. Hepatic Insufficiency: Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration. Hypotension: Dipyridamole should be used with caution in patients with hypotension since it can produce peripheral vasodilation. Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents: Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with dipyridamole tablets who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt dipyridamole tablets for 48 hours prior to stress testing. Intake of dipyridamole tablets within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. Laboratory Tests Dipyridamole has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dipyridamole tablets. The following information was obtained from the literature. Adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson): Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1,250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral dipyridamole doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, dipyridamole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers As dipyridamole is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when dipyridamole tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population below the age of 12 years have not been established."

In addition, angina pectoris has been reported rarely and there have been rare reports of liver dysfunction. On those uncommon occasions when adverse reactions have been persistent or intolerable, they have ceased on withdrawal of the medication. When dipyridamole tablets were administered concomitantly with warfarin, bleeding was no greater in frequency or severity than that observed when warfarin was administered alone. In rare cases, increased bleeding during or after surgery has been observed. In post-marketing reporting experience, there have been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, urticaria, severe bronchospasm, and angioedema), larynx edema, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthritis, nausea, dyspepsia, paresthesia, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, cholelithiasis, hypotension, palpitation, and tachycardia."

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose.

The recommended dose of Aspirin and Extended-Release Dipyridamole Capsules is one capsule given orally twice daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Swallow capsules whole without chewing. Aspirin and Extended-Release Dipyridamole Capsules can be administered with or without food. \u2022 One capsule twice daily (morning and evening) with or without food ( 2 ) \u2022 In case of intolerable headaches during initial treatment, switch to one capsule at bedtime and low-dose aspirin in the morning; resume BID dosing within one week ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Do not chew capsule ( 2 ) \u2022 Not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets ( 2 ) \u2022 Dispense in this unit-of-use container ( 16 ) 2.1 Alternative Regimen in Case of Intolerable Headaches In the event of intolerable headaches during initial treatment, switch to one capsule at bedtime and low-dose aspirin in the morning. Because there are no outcome data with this regimen and headaches become less of a problem as treatment continues, patients should return to the usual regimen as soon as possible, usually within one week."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules 48 hours before using intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents for stress testing ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur . In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] \u2022 Allergy [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] \u2022 Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Endo at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

Subject-years is defined as cumulative number of days on treatment divided by 365.25. Note: ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg. The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. NOS = not otherwise specified. Discontinuation due to adverse events in ESPS2 was 25% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25% for extended-release dipyridamole, 19% for aspirin, and 21% for placebo (refer to Table 2).

Subject-years is defined as cumulative number of days on treatment divided by 365.25. Note: ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg. The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson) Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A 2A -receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Because of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Data Human Data Published data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. Animal Data Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data) . Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u2011-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Absorption Dipyridamole: Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Aspirin: Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food Dipyridamole: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Aspirin: When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Aspirin: Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole: Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bb z with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole which was 13.6 hours. Aspirin: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dipyridamole: In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

Renal Dysfunction: Dipyridamole: In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Aspirin inhibits ovulation in rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

Figure 1 ESPS2: Cumulative Stroke Rate (Fatal or Nonfatal) Over 24 months of Follow-Up Combined Stroke or Death Endpoint In ESPS2, aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke or death by 24.2% compared to placebo. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke or death by 12.1% compared to aspirin alone and by 10.3% compared to extended-release dipyridamole alone. These results were not statistically significant. Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 11.3% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 11.0% for aspirin alone, 11.4% for extended-release dipyridamole alone and 12.3% for placebo alone. The differences between the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin alone and extended-release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant. These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients. Aspirin"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsulesincreases the risk of bleeding (5.1) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (5.2, 5.3) Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contain aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.4 Pregnancy Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contain aspirin, aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in the third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m 2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pregnant women. If aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.",

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1) ] Allergy [see Contraindications (4.2) ] Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or www.avkare.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6,602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6,602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. Other Adverse Events Adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in the ESPS2 study and that were medically judged to be possibly related to either dipyridamole or aspirin are listed below. Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction, fever Cardiovascular: Hypotension Central Nervous System: Coma, dizziness, paresthesia, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Gastrointestinal: Gastritis, ulceration and perforation Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Tinnitus and deafness. Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperglycemia, thirst Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Hematoma, gingival bleeding Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation Reproductive: Uterine hemorrhage Respiratory: Hyperpnea, asthma, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema Special Senses Other Disorders: Taste loss Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, urticaria Urogenital: Renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: Flushing Laboratory Changes Over the course of the 24-month study (ESPS2), patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole showed a decline (mean change from baseline) in hemoglobin of 0.25 g/dL, hematocrit of 0.75% and erythrocyte count of 0.13x10 6 /mm 3 .",
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6,602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events. Stroke Endpoint Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3). Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke by 36.8% compared to placebo (p <0.001).

Note: ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg. The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. ESPS2: Cumulative Stroke Rate (Fatal or Nonfatal) Over 24 months of Follow-UP Combined Stroke or Death Endpoint In ESPS2, aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke or death by 12.1% compared to aspirin alone and by 10.3% compared to extended-release dipyridamole alone. These results were not statistically significant. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the risk of stroke or death by 24.2% compared to placebo. Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 11.3% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 11% for aspirin alone, 11.4% for extended-release dipyridamole alone and 12.3% for placebo alone. The differences between the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin alone and extended-release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant. These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients. Figure 1"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with anti-coagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents.",

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential. Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin. Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3\",5\"-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3\",5\"guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A 2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other\"s inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Dipyridamole Absorption Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL). Effect of Food When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C max ) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20% to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. Distribution Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbz with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Due to the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole which, in Trial 9.123 was 13.6 hours. Special Populations Geriatric Patients: In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole. Hepatic Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure. Renal Dysfunction: No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with renal dysfunction. In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age. Aspirin Absorption Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin. Effect of Food When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. Distribution Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Metabolism and Elimination Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10) ] . Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. Special Populations Hepatic Dysfunction: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Renal Dysfunction: Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min). Aspirin and Extended-release Dipyridamole Capsules Drug Interaction A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state."

Aspirin, alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1,250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is believed that platelet reactivity and interaction with prosthetic cardiac valve surfaces, resulting in abnormally shortened platelet survival time, is a significant factor in thromboembolic complications occurring in connection with prosthetic heart valve replacement. Dipyridamole tablets have been found to lengthen abnormally shortened platelet survival time in a dose-dependent manner. In three randomized controlled clinical trials involving 854 patients who had undergone surgical placement of a prosthetic heart valve, dipyridamole tablets, in combination with warfarin, decreased the incidence of postoperative thromboembolic events by 62 to 91% compared to warfarin treatment alone. The incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving the combination of dipyridamole tablets and warfarin ranged from 1.2 to 1.8%. In three additional studies involving 392 patients taking dipyridamole tablets and coumarin-like anticoagulants, the incidence of thromboembolic events ranged from 2.3 to 6.9%. In these trials, the coumarin anticoagulant was begun between 24 hours and 4 days postoperatively, and the dipyridamole tablets were begun between 24 hours and 10 days postoperatively. The length of follow-up in these trials varied from 1 to 2 years. Dipyridamole tablets do not influence prothrombin time or activity measurements when administered with warfarin. Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5-1.9 mg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A 2 -receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). Hemodynamics In dogs intraduodenal doses of dipyridamole of 0.5 to 4.0 mg/kg produced dose-related decreases in systemic and coronary vascular resistance leading to decreases in systemic blood pressure and increases in coronary blood flow. Onset of action was in about 24 minutes and effects persisted for about 3 hours. Similar effects were observed following intravenous dipyridamole in doses ranging from 0.025 to 2.0 mg/kg. In man the same qualitative hemodynamic effects have been observed. However, acute intravenous administration of dipyridamole may worsen regional myocardial perfusion distal to partial occlusion of coronary arteries. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following an oral dose of dipyridamole tablets, the average time to peak concentration is about 75 minutes. The decline in plasma concentration following a dose of dipyridamole tablets fits a two-compartment model. The alpha half-life (the initial decline following peak concentration) is approximately 40 minutes. The beta half-life (the terminal decline in plasma concentration) is approximately 10 hours. Dipyridamole is highly bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized in the liver where it is conjugated as a glucuronide and excreted with the bile."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Coronary Artery Disease: Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect and should be used with caution in patients with severe coronary artery disease (e.g., unstable angina or recently sustained myocardial infarction). Chest pain may be aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. Hepatic Insufficiency: Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration. Hypotension: Dipyridamole should be used with caution in patients with hypotension since it can produce peripheral vasodilation. Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents: Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with dipyridamole tablets who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt dipyridamole tablets for 48 hours prior to stress testing. Intake of dipyridamole tablets within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. Laboratory Tests Dipyridamole has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dipyridamole tablets. The following information was obtained from the literature. Adenosinergic agents (e.g., adenosine, regadenoson): Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A2A-receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m 2 basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose (MRHD) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral dipyridamole doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1 \u00bd, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, dipyridamole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers As dipyridamole is excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when dipyridamole tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population below the age of 12 years have not been established."
