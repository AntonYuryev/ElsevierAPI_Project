      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 Less than 25 50% 0.5 \u20131.5 25-50 67% Greater than 1.5 Greater than 50 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x 10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than15 % Dose in the Next Course 50-75 100 50 33 Greater than 75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration : For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration : The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability : Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute Azacitidine for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for Injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for Injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.6, 2.7) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Shilpa Medicare Limited 1-888-557-1212 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Renal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to Azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with Azacitidine was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of Azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of Azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous Azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders : agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders : atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders : eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders : diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions : catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders : cholecystitis. Immune system disorders : anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations : abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders : dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified : leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders : cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders : loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures : cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders : orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\"observation\") in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u2264 50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6 ; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7 ). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 (5.6) 0 (0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive Azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous Azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous Azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \"improved.\" About 24% of Azacitidine -treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8 ). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45.0%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azacitidine for injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of: Adult patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). ( 1.1) 1.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Azacitidine for injection is indicated for treatment of adult patients with the following French-American- British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir% decrease in countsfrom baseline Bone MarrowBiopsy Cellularity at Timeof Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in theNext Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serumcreatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine For Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the syringe must be re-suspended by inverting the syringe 2-3 times and vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms for 30 seconds immediately prior to administration. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C(36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 A nemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closelyfor toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 ) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labelingsections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical TrialsExperience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS:Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio- respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock,hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Azacitidine for injection contains azacitidine, which is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor. Azacitidine is 4-amino-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one. The structural formula is as follows: The empirical formula is C 8 H 12 N 4 O 5 . The molecular weight is 244.20. Azacitidine is a white to off- white powder. Azacitidine was found to be soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide, sparingly soluble in water and insoluble in acetone and ethanol. The finished product is supplied in a sterile form for reconstitution as a suspension for subcutaneous injection or reconstitution as a solution with further dilution for intravenous infusion. Vials of azacitidine for injection contain 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg mannitol as a sterile lyophilized powder."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination MetabolismAn in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. SpecificPopulations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day.Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems :An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment. T able 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine for injection-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine for injection randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. T able 8.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was13.0 months. Table 9.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5-1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures .1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16 ) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10-40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with azacitidine was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio\u00ad respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders : loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 - 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 - 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CL cr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 mcM (IV C max = 10.6 mcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 mcM to 100 mcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2 mg/kg (6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration > 4 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration > 4 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201dAbout 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 - 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir% decrease in countsfrom baseline Bone MarrowBiopsy Cellularity at Timeof Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50 - 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in theNext Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serumcreatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the syringe must be re-suspended by inverting the syringe 2-3 times and vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms for 30 seconds immediately prior to administration. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability : Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C(36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5.2 A nemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closelyfor toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labelingsections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical TrialsExperience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDSThe data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS:Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio- respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock,hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitdine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility[see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination MetabolismAn in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. SpecificPopulations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day.Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems :An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products,antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment. T able 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. T able 8.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8).In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was13.0 months.

The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). \u2022 MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). \u2022 Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values \u2022 For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x 10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 - 1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25 - 50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% \u2022 For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x 10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x 10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50 - 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration : For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration : The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability : Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50-100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute Azacitidine for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). \u2022 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for Injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for Injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 ) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: \u0366 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u0366 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u0366 Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u0366 Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to Azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous Azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

A patient experienced diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m 2 , almost 4 times the recommended starting dose. The events resolved without sequelae, and the correct dose was resumed the following day. In the event of overdosage, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment, as necessary.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Nonproliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u2264 50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine treatment.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous Azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous Azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of Azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9: Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50 - 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 ) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg per mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg per mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3 ) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes . The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6 ; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7 ). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8 ). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit (2.3). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Table 1 Table 2 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Table 3 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine (2.1, 5.1). \u2022 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently (5.2). \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity (5.3). \u2022 Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys (5.4). \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate (5.5). \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception (5.6). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1 ) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1)] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6, 2.7) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: o Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] o Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] o Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] o Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Somerset Therapeutics, LLC at 1-800-417-9175 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (post implantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells;and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cellsystems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells;and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cellsystems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine -treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine -treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9.

The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for Injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). \u2022MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for Injection 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). \u2022Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit (2.3). \u2022Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for Injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x109 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x109 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x109 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x109 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x109 /L, or platelets less than 75 x109 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Table 1 Table 2 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 1 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 1 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Table 3 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine (2.1, 5.1). \u2022Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently (5.2). \u2022Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity (5.3). \u2022Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys (5.4). \u2022Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for Injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate (5.5). \u2022Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception (5.6). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for Injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for Injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine for Injection may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1 ) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for Injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for Injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6, 2.7) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for Injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: o Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] o Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] o Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] o Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Reliance Life Sciences PVT. LTD. at 1-800-889-2333 / rls.drugsafety@relbio.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 2 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine -treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with azacitidine was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months). In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed (8.2) Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (post implantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells;and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cellsystems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 5). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 4. Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics Table 5. Response Criteria The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine -treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 6). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 6. Response Rates Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine -treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 7.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). \u25022.1 Important Administration Information \u2502Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x 10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 Less than 25 50% 0.5 1.5 25-50 67% Greater than 1.5 Greater than 50 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x 10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x 10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50 - 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration : For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration : The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute Azacitidine for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). \u25025.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products \u2502Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for Injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for Injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine may not be effective. \u2502Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6 , 2.7 ) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. \u2502Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Shilpa Medicare Limited 1-888-557-1212 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Renal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to Azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m\u00b2. In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m\u00b2. Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of Azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of Azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous Azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose [ see Data ]. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m\u00b2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\"observation\") in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts 50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoeitic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine ( N = 89 ) Observation Before Crossover ( N = 83 ) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 (5.6) 0 (0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive Azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous Azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous Azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \"improved.\" About 24% of Azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: ( Intent-to-Treat Population ) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusions independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for Injection 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for Injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] and delay or reduce dosage if necessary as described below. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.4 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 to 1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25 to 50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30 to 60 15 to 30 Less than 15 50 to 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. If unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 2.6 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 2.7 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for Injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for Injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.8 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for Injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. When Azacitidine for Injection is reconstituted using Sterile Water for Injection that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted product may be held under refrigerated conditions (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 12 hours. When Azacitidine for Injection is reconstituted using refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, the reconstituted product may be stored under refrigerated conditions (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 30 hours. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for Injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Doses greater than 4 mL should be divided equally into 2 syringes and injected into 2 separate sites. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Suspension Stability Azacitidine for Injection reconstituted with non-refrigerated Sterile Water for Injection for subcutaneous administration may be stored for up to 2 hours at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for up to 12 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). When reconstituted with refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, it may be stored for 30 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). 2.9 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for Injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for Injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for Injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for Injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for Injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for Injection vial. Solution Stability Azacitidine for Injection reconstituted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine for Injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for Injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for Injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine for Injection may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for Injection for oral azacitidine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for Injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. After administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because Azacitidine for Injection is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin less than 30 g/L. Azacitidine for Injection is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [ see Contraindications (4) ] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for Injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to less than 20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML (an unapproved use) treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate less than 20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for Injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, azacitidine caused adverse developmental outcomes when administered to mice and rats at doses of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 and 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 4% to 16% and 8%) of the recommended human daily dose of 75 mg/m 2 , respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Renal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 MDS patients from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS : nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (Greater Than 2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS : Discontinuation : leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held : leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced : leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 1 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group; patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 5% (and not described in Tables 1 or 2) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia, splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4% to 16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 to 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 to 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of azacitidine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on a breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfeed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Azacitidine for Injection. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 6 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for Injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients less than 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE One case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical trials. A patient experienced diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m 2 , almost 4 times the recommended starting dose. The events resolved without sequelae, and the correct dose was resumed the following day. In the event of overdosage, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for Azacitidine for Injection overdosage."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The area under the curve (AUC) and peak concentration (C max ) of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the dose range of 25 mg/m 2 (0.33 times the lowest approved recommended dosage) to 100 mg/m 2 (the maximum approved recommended dosage). The mean and standard deviation (SD) of C max was 750 \u00b1 403 ng/mL after a single subcutaneous administration of 75 mg/m 2 azacitidine. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration with a median time to C max (T max ) of 0.5 hour. The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on AUC. Distribution Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Elimination Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for less than 1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection). However due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations.). This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug Interaction Studies No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites that compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts less than or equal to 50 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC less than 1 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 3; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 4). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 3.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine -treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 5). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 5. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 (5.6) 0 (0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in MDS patients with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 to 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 6). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 6. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in MDS Patients Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza \u00ae (azacitidine for injection).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS:The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ) Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 2.4 Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 -1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 % Dose in the Next Course 50 - 75 100 50 33 Greater than 75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved.To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection,USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection,USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection,USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to Azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of Azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of Azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous Azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3 ) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failur. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6 ; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7 ). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine for injection treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in Azacitidine for injection-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all Azacitidine for injection randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) ( Table 8 ). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine for injection (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive Azacitidine for injection treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous Azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous Azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of Azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8 ). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45.0%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) 14.2 Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir% decrease in countsfrom baseline Bone MarrowBiopsy Cellularity at Timeof Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in theNext Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serumcreatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the syringe must be re-suspended by inverting the syringe 2-3 times and vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms for 30 seconds immediately prior to administration. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability : Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storagetimelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C(36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5.2 A nemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closelyfor toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labelingsections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical TrialsExperience ecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDSThe data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS:Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio- respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock,hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10.Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility[see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10.Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities)."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Azacitidine for injection contains azacitidine, which is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor. Azacitidine is 4-amino-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one. The structural formula is as follows: The empirical formula is C 8 H 12 N 4 O 5 . The molecular weight is 244.20. Azacitidine is a white to off- white powder. Azacitidine was found to be soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide, sparingly soluble in water and insoluble in acetone and ethanol. The finished product is supplied in a sterile form for reconstitution as a suspension for subcutaneous injection or reconstitution as a solution with further dilution for intravenous infusion. Vials of azacitidine for injection contain 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg mannitol as a sterile lyophilized powder."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination MetabolismAn in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. SpecificPopulations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day.Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems :An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \uf0a350.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products,antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment. T able 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8).In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was13.0 months.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5-1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures .1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16 ) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10-40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with azacitidine was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio\u00ad respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders : loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 - 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 - 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CL cr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 mcM (IV C max = 10.6 mcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 mcM to 100 mcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2 mg/kg (6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration > 4 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration > 4 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201dAbout 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 - 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS:The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ) Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 -1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 % Dose in the Next Course 50 - 75 100 50 33 Greater than 75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for Azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to Azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine for injection in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with Azacitidine for injection was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of Azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of Azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous Azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3 ) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Azacitidine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Interstitial lung disease Tumor lysis syndrome Injection site necrosis Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) Differentiation syndrome Pericardial effusion Pericarditis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6 ; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7 ). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine for injection treatment. Table 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8.

Treatment with subcutaneous Azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous Azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of Azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8 ). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45.0%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting. ( 2.2 ) Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit. ( 2.3 ) Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate. ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ) 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x 10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 to 1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25 to 50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x 10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x 10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x 10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30 to 60 15 to 30 Less than 15 % Dose in the Next Course 50 to 75 Greater than 75 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 ) ] . 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 mL to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently. ( 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity. ( 5.3 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys. ( 5.4 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. ( 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin < 30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to < 20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate < 20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Most common adverse reactions (> 30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (> 2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with azacitidine was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g., erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g., infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 mg/m 2 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4% to 16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 to 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 to 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 mg/m 2 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 mg/m 2 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/mL occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes . The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for < 1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/mL occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes . The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for < 1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 mg/m 2 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 mg/m 2 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u2264 50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC < 1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8: Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0.0) (< 0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 (5.6) 0 (0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 to 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9: Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azacitidine for injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of: Adult patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Azacitidine for injection is indicated for treatment of adult patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate (2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir% decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir(%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 % Dose in the Next Course 50-75 100 50 33 Greater than 75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the syringe must be re-suspended by inverting the syringe 2-3 times and vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms for 30 seconds immediately prior to administration. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability :Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently (5.2) . Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ) . Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception (5.6). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: \u2022 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia (6.1) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact North Star RxLLc AT 1-844-375-6847 or FDA at 1-800-332-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS:Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 1 or 2) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio\u00ad-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed (8.2) . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 - 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 - 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day.Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products,antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 4). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment. T able 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. T able 8.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 - 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9.

Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 - 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9.

Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50 - 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg per mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg per mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes . The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes . The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6 ; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7 ). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) ( Table 8 ). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azacitidine for injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). ( 1 ) 1.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Azacitidine for injection is indicated for treatment of patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL)."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting. ( 2.1 ) Repeat cycles every 4 weeks ( 2.2 ). After 2 cycles, may increase dose to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen and no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred ( 2.2 ). Patients should be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. Complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.2 ). Monitor patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ). 2.1 First Treatment Cycle The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.2 Subsequent Treatment Cycles Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary as described below. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3.0 \u00d710 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 \u00d710 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75.0 \u00d710 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (\u00d710 9 /L) Platelets (\u00d710 9 /L) Less than 0.5 Less than 25 50% 0.5 \u20131.5 25-50 67% Greater than 1.5 Greater than 50 100% For patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3.0 \u00d710 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 \u00d710 9 /L, or platelets less than 75.0 \u00d710 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 % Dose in the Next Course 50 - 75 100 50 33 greater than 75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. 2.4 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.5 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 2.6 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.7 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL sterile water for injection. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. The resulting suspension will contain azacitidine 25 mg/mL. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. When Azacitidine for injection is reconstituted using water for injection that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted product may be held under refrigerated conditions (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F - 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. When Azacitidine for injection is reconstituted using refrigerated (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F - 46\u00b0F) water for injection, the reconstituted product may be stored under refrigerated conditions (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F - 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Suspension Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted with non-refrigerated water for injection for subcutaneous administration may be stored for up to 1 hour at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for up to 8 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F); when reconstituted with refrigerated (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0F - 46\u00b0F) water for injection, it may be stored for 22 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). 2.8 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL sterile water for injection. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.1 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.2 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.3 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.4 ). Embryo-Fetal Risk: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. After administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. 5.3 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for nonMDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) ] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. 5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Risk Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females with reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with azacitidine for injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Men should be advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with azacitidine for injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Embryo-Fetal Risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route): nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route): Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Most common adverse reactions (>30%) by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-367-3395 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 MDS patients from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Table 1 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 1 or 2) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Discontinue nursing taking into consideration the importance of drug to mother ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with azacitidine for injection. Males Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should not father a child and should use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Azacitidine for injection contains azacitidine, which is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is 4-amino-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-s-triazin-2(1H)-one. The structural formula is as follows: The empirical formula is C 8 H 12 N 4 O 5 . The molecular weight is 244. Azacitidine is a white to off-white solid. Azacitidine was found to be insoluble in acetone, ethanol, and methyl ethyl ketone; slightly soluble in ethanol/water (50/50), propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol; sparingly soluble in water, water saturated octanol, 5% dextrose in water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, normal saline and 5% Tween 80 in water; and soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The finished product is supplied in a sterile form for reconstitution as a suspension for subcutaneous injection or reconstitution as a solution with further dilution for intravenous infusion. Vials of azacitidine for injection contain 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg mannitol as a sterile lyophilized powder. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 MDS patients following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen does not result in drug accumulation. Elimination Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations In patients with cancer the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Therefore, a Cycle 1 dose modification is not recommended. The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine may be metabolized by the liver. Whether azacitidine metabolism may be affected by known microsomal enzyme inhibitors or inducers has not been studied. An in vitro study with cultured human hepatocytes indicated that azacitidine at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV C max = 10.6 \u00b5M) does not cause any inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. The potential of azacitidine to inhibit other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is not known. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% - 40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\"observation\") in patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 3; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 4). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment. Table 3.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 5. Response Rates Azacitidine for Injection (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \"improved.\" About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in MDS patients with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 6 ). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 6.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit; ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x109/L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x109/L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x109/L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 Less than 25 50% 0.5 to 1.5 25 to 50 67% Greater than 1.5 Greater than 50 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x109/L, ANC less than 1.5 x109/L, or platelets less than 75 x109/L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (% ) 30 to 60 15 to 30 Less than 15 % Dose in the Next Course 50 to 75 100 50 33 Greater than 75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2. Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0 C/77\u00b0 F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0 C (77\u00b0 F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0 to 8 \u00b0 C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C / 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2 \u00b0 to 8\u00b0 C (36 \u00b0 to 46\u00b0 F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin < 30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to < 20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate < 20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4% to 16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 to 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 to 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose . 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration . Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for < 1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2 mg/kg (6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u2264 50 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC < 1 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u2265 4 weeks Marrow < 5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR) , duration \u2265 4 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u2265 50% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u2265 50% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u2265 75% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine Observation Before Crossover (N=89) (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 (5.6) 0 (0) \uff080.06\uff09 Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 to 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 9). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n=179) Conventional Care Regimens (n=179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation\u2019s Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 \u20131.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir% decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serumcreatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine For Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the syringe must be re-suspended by inverting the syringe 2-3 times and vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms for 30 seconds immediately prior to administration. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability : Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closelyfor toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labelingsections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal Toxicity[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine for injection in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine for injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine for injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine for injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine for injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine for injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine for injection in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with azacitidine for injection was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine for injection, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine for injection. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine for injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio- respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease -Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine for injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine for injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine for injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 1 week after the last dose 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine for injection. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine for injection and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility[see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine for injection in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination MetabolismAn in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u00b5M) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems :An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts <50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine for injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine for injection-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine for injection randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine for injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine For Injection (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 (0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine for injection treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine for injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine for injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8).In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) 95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0 %) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] , and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5-1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25-50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures .1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability : Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10-40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). \u2022 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Table 4 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine in Study 4. Similar to Studies 1 and 2 described above, duration of exposure to treatment with azacitidine was longer (mean 12.2 months) compared with best supportive care (mean 7.5 months).

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio\u00ad respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders : loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial lung disease - Tumor lysis syndrome - Injection site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) - Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) - Differentiation syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 - 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 - 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 - 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 - 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities)."

In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE One case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical trials. A patient experienced diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m 2 , almost 4 times the recommended starting dose. The events resolved without sequelae, and the correct dose was resumed the following day. In the event of overdosage, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment, as necessary.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CL cr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 mcM (IV C max = 10.6 mcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 mcM to 100 mcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2 mg/kg (6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201dAbout 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 - 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azacitidine for injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). (1) 1.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Azacitidine for injection is indicated for treatment of patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL)."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection or intravenous (IV) infusion. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting. ( 2.1 ) Repeat cycles every 4 weeks (2.2) . After 2 cycles, may increase dose to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen and no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred ( 2.2 ). Patients should be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. Complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.2 ). Monitor patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ). 2.1 First Treatment Cycle The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.2 Subsequent Treatment Cycles Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary as described below. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC \u22653.0 x10 9 /L, ANC \u22651.5 x 10 9 /L, and platelets \u226575.0 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC ( x10 9 / L ) Platelets ( x10 9 / L ) <0.5 <25.0 50% 0.5 \u20131.5 25.0-50.0 67% >1.5 >50.0 100% For patients whose baseline counts are WBC <3.0 x10 9 /L, ANC<1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets <75.0 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline 30-60 15-30 <15 % Dose in the Next Course 50-75 100 50 33 >75 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are >25% above the nadir and rising. If a >25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. 2.4 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to <20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 2.5 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.6 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.7 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL sterile water for injection. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. The resulting suspension will contain Azacitidine 25 mg/mL. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration : Doses greater than 4 mL should be divided equally into 2 syringes. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration : The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. Doses greater than 4 mL should be divided equally into 2 syringes. The product must be refrigerated immediately. When Azacitidine for injection is reconstituted using water for injection that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted product may be held under refrigerated conditions (2\u00baC-8\u00baC, 36\u00baF-46\u00baF) for up to 8 hours. When azacitidine for injection is reconstituted using refrigerated (2\u00baC-8\u00baC, 36\u00baF-46\u00baF) water for injection, the reconstituted product may be stored under refrigerated conditions (2\u00baC-8\u00baC, 36\u00baF-46\u00baF) for up to 22 hours. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Doses greater than 4 mL should be divided equally into 2 syringes and injected into 2 separate sites. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Suspension Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted with non-refrigerated water for injection for subcutaneous administration may be stored for up to 1 hour at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for up to 8 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F); when reconstituted with refrigerated (2\u00baC - 8\u00baC, 36\u00baF - 46\u00baF) water for injection, it may be stored for 22 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). 2.8 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL sterile water for injection. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain Azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 - 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for injection reconstituted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.1 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.2 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since Azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.3 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.4 ). Embryo-Fetal Risk: Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. After administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because Azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during Azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [ see Contraindications (4.1) ].Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. 5.3 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous Azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for nonMDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with Azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, Azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. 5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.5 Embryo Fetal Risk Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females with reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with Azacitidine for injection [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Men should be advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with Azacitidine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Embryo-Fetal Risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (SC or IV Route) : nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by IV route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (SC or IV Route): Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Most common adverse reactions (>30%) by SC route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by IV route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia (6.1) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 MDS patients from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (SC administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with SC administration and one with IV administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (SC administration) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the IV study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Table 1 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine (SC) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine -treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with SC administration of Azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of Azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of SC treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the IV and SC studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the IV route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either SC or IV Azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 1 or 2) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders : agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders : atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders : eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders : diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions : catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders : cholecystitis. Immune system disorders : anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations : abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders : dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified : leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders : cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders : loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures : cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders : orthostatic hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Interstitial lung disease Tumor lysis syndrome Injection site necrosis Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Discontinue nursing taking into consideration the importance of drug to mother (8.2) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of Azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose [see Data].Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, Azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study Azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with Azacitidine. Males Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should not father a child and should use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to Azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CL cr ] < 30 mL/min) has no major effect on the exposure of Azacitidine after multiple SC administrations. Therefore, Azacitidine can be administered to patients with renal impairment without Cycle 1 dose adjustment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Gender There were no clinically relevant differences in safety and efficacy based on gender. 8.8 Race Greater than 90% of all patients in all trials were Caucasian. Therefore, no comparisons between Caucasians and non-Caucasians were possible."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no data on the use of Azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose [see Data].Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, Azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study Azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of Azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to Azacitidine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Azacitidine were studied in 6 MDS patients following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous (SC) dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous (IV) dose. Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after SC administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour. The bioavailability of SC Azacitidine relative to IV azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following IV dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent SC clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after SC administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of SC administration of Azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation. Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of Azacitidine and its metabolites. Following IV administration of radioactive Azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following SC administration of 14 C-Azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (Azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after IV and SC administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations In patients with cancer the pharmacokinetics of Azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were compared following daily SC dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased Azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Therefore, a Cycle 1 dose modification is not recommended. The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of Azacitidine have not been studied. Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with Azacitidine have been conducted. An in vitro study of Azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that Azacitidine may be metabolized by the liver. Whether Azacitidine metabolism may be affected by known microsomal enzyme inhibitors or inducers has not been studied. An in vitro study with cultured human hepatocytes indicated that azacitidine at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV Cmax = 10.6 \u03bcM) does not cause any inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. The potential of Azacitidine to inhibit other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is not known. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that Azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with Azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of Azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of Azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of Azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine for injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\"observation\") in patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u2264 50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoeitic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in (Table 3); the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 4). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine treatment. Table 3.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 5.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \"improved.\" About 24% of Azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in MDS patients with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive Azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with Azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = Azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 6). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 6.

The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x 10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 to 1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25 to 50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30 to 60 15 to 30 Less than 15 50 to 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products : Do not substitute azacitidine for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). Hepatotoxicity : Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). Renal Toxicity : Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 , 2.7) ] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: o Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] o Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] o Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] o Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio\u00ad respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4% to 16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 to 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 to 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u2264 50.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N = 89) Observation Before Crossover (N = 83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 (0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 (5.6) 0 (0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 (0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 to 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n = 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n = 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45.0%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azacitidine for injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of: \u00b7 Adult patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Azacitidine for injection is indicated for treatment of adult patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u00b7 Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). \u00b7 MDS: The recommended starting dosage for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is azacitidine for injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. See full prescribing information for schedule for subsequent cycles. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting ( 2.2 ). \u00b7 Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.3 ). \u00b7 Monitor all patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.6 , 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for azacitidine for injection differ from that of oral azacitidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 2.2 First Treatment Cycle for Adults The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.3 Subsequent Treatment Cycles for Adults Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values \u00b7 For adult patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 0.5 to 1.5 Greater than 1.5 Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 25 25 to 50 Greater than 50 50% 67% 100% \u00b7 For adult patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30 to 60 15 to 30 Less than 15 50 to 75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.7 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.8 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16) ] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.9 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. See Table 2 for suspension stability storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for delayed subcutaneous administration. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Table 2 Suspension Stability: Storage timelines based on the temperature of the diluent for suspension stability storage: Suspension Stability Storage timelines Diluent Storage Temperature/Duration Room temperature (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store at room temperature at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 1 hour or refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 8 hours. Cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) Sterile Water for Injection, USP Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 22 hours. 2.10 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration. Adult Patients with MDS Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 to 100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial. Solution Stability: Azacitidine for injection reconstituted and diluted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine ( 2.1 , 5.1 ). \u00b7 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.2 ). \u00b7 Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.3 ). \u00b7 Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.4 ). \u00b7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.5 ). \u00b7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Azacitidine can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , the recommended dose and schedule for azacitidine for injection are different from those of oral azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using azacitidine for injection at the recommended dosage of oral azacitidine may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using oral azacitidine at the doses recommended for azacitidine for injection may not be effective. Do not substitute azacitidine for injection for oral azacitidine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5.2 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with MDS. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. In adult patients with MDS, after administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.4 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 )] . Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: o Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] o Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) ] o Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] o Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (>30%) in adult patients with MDS by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MDS The data described below reflect exposure to azacitidine in 443 patients with MDS from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 2 99% were white. Most patients received daily azacitidine doses of 75 mg/m . Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) in Adult Patients with MDS: Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with azacitidine (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the azacitidine-treated group than for the observation group: patients received azacitidine for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

In Studies 1, 2 and 4 with subcutaneous administration of azacitidine, adverse reactions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction tended to increase in incidence with higher doses of azacitidine. Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of <5% (and not described in Tables 2 or 3) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2212 Interstitial lung disease \u2212 Tumor lysis syndrome \u2212 Injection site necrosis \u2212 Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) \u2212 Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) \u2212 Differentiation syndrome \u2212 Pericardial effusion \u2212 Pericarditis \u2212 Cutaneous vasculitis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4% to 16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4 to 8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1 to 3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of azacitidine on the breastfed infant, or the effects of azacitidine on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from azacitidine, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, can cause fetal harm when azacitidine administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating azacitidine. Contraception Females Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with azacitidine and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in pediatric patients with MDS have not been established. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients <65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However,due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 adult patients with MDS following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour after subcutaneous administration. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes. The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation with intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Elimination Metabolism An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. Excretion Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacytidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, or race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and subcutaneous azacitidine have not been studied. Pediatric Patients Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection). However, due to Celgene Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with cancer, the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: An in vitro study at azacitidine concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (IV C max = 10.6 \u03bcM) in human liver microsomes indicated that azacitidine does not cause any inhibition of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Transporter Systems: An in vitro study with LLC-PK1 cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) indicated that azacitidine is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Azacitidine does not inhibit, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20% to 80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in adult patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 6; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 7). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment. Table 6.

Response Criteria RA RARS RAEB RAEB-T CMMoL Complete Response (CR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow <5% blasts Peripheral Blood Normal CBC if abnormal at baseline Absence of blasts in the peripheral circulation Partial Response (PR), duration \u22654 weeks Marrow No marrow requirements \u226550% decrease in blasts Improvement of marrow dyspoiesis Peripheral Blood \u226550% restoration in the deficit from normal levels of baseline white cells, hemoglobin and platelets if abnormal at baseline No blasts in the peripheral circulation For CMMoL, if WBC is elevated at baseline, a \u226575% reduction in the excess count over the upper limit of normal The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine -treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p<0.0001) (Table 8). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 8. Response Rates Azacitidine (N=89) Observation Before Crossover (N=83) Response n (%) n (%) P value Overall (CR+PR) 14 (15.7) 0 ( 0.0) (<0.0001) Complete (CR) 5 ( 5.6) 0 ( 0.0) (0.06) Partial (PR) 9 (10.1) 0 ( 0.0) -- Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%. Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of azacitidine -treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 to 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause: (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 8). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 9. Effect of Azacitidine on RBC Transfusions in Patients with MDS Efficacy Parameter Azacitidine plus BSC (n= 179) Conventional Care Regimens (n= 179) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline who became transfusion independent on treatment 1 50/111 (45.0%) (95% CI: 35.6%, 54.8%) 13/114 (11.4%) (95% CI: 6.2%, 18.7%) Number and percent of patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline who became transfusion-dependent on treatment 10/68 (14.7%) (95% CI: 7.3%, 25.4%) 28/65 (43.1%) (95% CI: 30.9%, 56.0%) 1 A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent. Pediatric use information is approved for Celgene Corporation's Vidaza (azacitidine for injection).

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azacitidine for Injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). 1.1 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Azacitidine for Injection is indicated for treatment of patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL)."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology values, is Azacitidine for Injection 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days to be administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Premedicate for nausea and vomiting. ( 2.1 ) Repeat cycles every 4 weeks ( 2.2 ). After 2 cycles, may increase dose to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen and no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred ( 2.2 ). Patients should be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. Complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles ( 2.2 ). Continue treatment as long as the patient continues to benefit ( 2.2 ). Monitor patients for hematologic response and for renal toxicity; delay or reduce dosage as appropriate ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ). 2.1 First Treatment Cycle The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting. Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose. 2.2 Subsequent Treatment Cycles Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ], and delay or reduce dosage if necessary as described below. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values For patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3.0 x10 9 /L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10 9 /L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75.0 x10 9 /L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle: Nadir Counts % Dose in the Next Course ANC (x10 9 /L) Platelets (x10 9 /L) Less than 0.5 Less than 25 50% 0.5-1.5 25-50 67% Greater than 1.5 Greater than 50 100% For patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3.0 x10 9 /L, ANC less than 1.5 x10 9 /L, or platelets less than 75.0 x10 9 /L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose. WBC or Platelet Nadir % decrease in counts from baseline Bone Marrow Biopsy Cellularity at Time of Nadir (%) 30-60 15-30 Less than 15 50-75 Greater than 75 % Dose in the Next Course 100 50 33 75 50 33 If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%. 2.4 Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 2.5 Use in Geriatric Patients Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 ) ]. 2.6 Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection Azacitidine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The Azacitidine for Injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly [ see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Do not save any unused portions for later administration. 2.7 Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Reconstitute Azacitidine for Injection aseptically with 4 mL sterile water for injection. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. The resulting suspension will contain azacitidine 25 mg/mL. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance. Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g. dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution. Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration: The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g. dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. When Azacitidine for Injection is reconstituted using water for injection that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted product may be held under refrigerated conditions (2\u00baC-8\u00baC, 36\u00baF-46\u00baF) for up to 8 hours. When Azacitidine for Injection is reconstituted using refrigerated (2\u00baC-8\u00baC, 36\u00baF-46\u00baF) water for injection, the reconstituted product may be stored under refrigerated conditions (2\u00baC-8\u00baC, 36\u00baF- 46\u00baF) for up to 22 hours. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. Subcutaneous Administration To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. Azacitidine for Injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Suspension Stability : Azacitidine for Injection reconstituted with non-refrigerated water for injection for subcutaneous administration may be stored for up to 1 hour at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for up to 8 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F); when reconstituted with refrigerated (2\u00baC -8\u00baC, 36\u00baF-46\u00baF) water for injection, it may be stored for 22 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). 2.8 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Reconstitute the appropriate number of Azacitidine for Injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL sterile water for injection. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg/mL. The solution should be clear. Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the required amount of Azacitidine for Injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50-100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection. Intravenous Solution Incompatibility Azacitidine for Injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of Azacitidine for Injection and should therefore be avoided. Intravenous Administration Azacitidine for Injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10-40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the Azacitidine for Injection vial. Solution Stability : Azacitidine for Injection reconstituted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently ( 5.1 ). Hepatotoxicity: Patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment are at higher risk for toxicity ( 5.2 ). Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients with renal impairment for toxicity since azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys ( 5.3 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Azacitidine for Injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5.4 ). Embryo-Fetal Risk: Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia Azacitidine for Injection causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. After administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin <30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. Safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for Injection in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. 5.3 Renal Toxicity Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate <20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5) ]. Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. 5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Azacitidine for Injection may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Risk Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females with reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Men should be advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with Azacitidine for Injection."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections: o Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] o Hepatotoxocity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] o Renal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] o Tumor Lysis Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] o Embryo-Fetal Risk [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) : nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia, ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (>2%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention (Subcutaneous or Intravenous Route) : Discontinuation: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Dose Held: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. Most common adverse reactions (>30%) by subcutaneous route are: nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, pyrexia, leukopenia, diarrhea, injection site erythema, constipation, neutropenia and ecchymosis. Most common adverse reactions by intravenous route also included petechiae, rigors, weakness and hypokalemia ( 6.1 ).

The data described below reflect exposure to Azacitidine for Injection in 443 MDS patients from 4 clinical studies. Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to Azacitidine for Injection, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine for Injection was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m 2 . In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to Azacitidine for Injection. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white. Most patients received daily Azacitidine for Injection doses of 75 mg/m 2 . Table 1 presents adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with Azacitidine for Injection (subcutaneous) in Studies 1 and 2. It is important to note that duration of exposure was longer for the Azacitidine for Injection-treated group than for the observation group: patients received Azacitidine for Injection for a mean of 11.4 months while mean time in the observation arm was 6.1 months.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment. Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage). In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous Azacitidine for Injection, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of < 5% (and not described in Tables 1 or 2) were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardiorespiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy. Eye disorders: eye hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal disorders: diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess. General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: leukemia cutis. Nervous system disorders: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage. Renal and urinary disorders: loin pain, renal failure. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration. Surgical and medical procedures: cholecystectomy. Vascular disorders: orthostatic hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Azacitidine for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Interstitial lung disease Tumor lysis syndrome Injection site necrosis Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) Necrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases) Differentiation syndrome"

Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses lower than the recommended human daily dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single IP (intraperitoneal) injection of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) azacitidine on gestation day 10. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation day 15 at doses of ~3-12 mg/m 2 (approximately 4%-16% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In rats, azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given IP on gestation days 4-8 (postimplantation) at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% of the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis), although treatment in the preimplantation period (on gestation days 1-3) had no adverse effect on the embryos. Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single IP dose of 3 to 12 mg/m 2 (approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) given on gestation day 9, 10, 11 or 12. In this study azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3-12 mg/m 2 on gestation days 9 and 10; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9% of control at the highest dose on gestation day 9. Fetal anomalies included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly), and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, edema, and rib abnormalities). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk, the effects of Azacitidine for Injection on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Azacitidine for Injection on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azacitidine in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Azacitidine for Injection, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Azacitidine for Injection. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection. Males Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should not father a child and should use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine for Injection. Infertility Based on animal data, azacitidine could have an effect on male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2 and 3, 62% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In addition, there were no relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients. Of the 179 patients randomized to azacitidine in Study 4, 68% were 65 years and older and 21% were 75 years and older. Survival data for patients 65 years and older were consistent with overall survival results. The majority of adverse reactions occurred at similar frequencies in patients < 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Monitor renal function in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3 ) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine for Injection is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine for Injection is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 MDS patients following a single 75 mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m 2 intravenous dose. Absorption Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 \u00b1 403 ng/mL occurred in 0.5 hour. Distribution The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 \u00b1 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 \u00b1 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 \u00b1 8 minutes . The AUC and C max of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation. Elimination Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours. Specific Populations In patients with cancer the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m 2 . Therefore, a Cycle 1 dose modification is not recommended. The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. Drug-Drug Interactions No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine may be metabolized by the liver. Whether azacitidine metabolism may be affected by known microsomal enzyme inhibitors or inducers has not been studied. An in vitro study with cultured human hepatocytes indicated that azacitidine at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (IV C max = 10.6 \u00b5M) does not cause any inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. The potential of azacitidine to inhibit other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is not known. In vitro studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5."

Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls. The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m 2 (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m 2 (approximately 20%-40% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m 2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous Azacitidine for Injection plus supportive care with supportive care alone (\u201cobservation\u201d) in patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts \u226450.0 x 10 9 /L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC <1.0 x 10 9 /L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 3; the 2 groups were similar. Azacitidine for Injection was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m 2 if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to Azacitidine for Injection if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 4). Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive Azacitidine for Injection treatment. Table 3.

The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to Azacitidine for Injection had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5 th treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. Table 5.

Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous Azacitidine for Injection resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous Azacitidine for Injection resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine for Injection dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study. Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered \u201cimproved.\u201d About 24% of Azacitidine for Injection-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days. Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in MDS patients with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause : (Intent-to-Treat Population) Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 6). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months. Table 6.
