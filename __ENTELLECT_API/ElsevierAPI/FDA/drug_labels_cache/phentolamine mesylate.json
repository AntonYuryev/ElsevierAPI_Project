      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The reconstituted solution should be used upon preparation and should not be stored. Note: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 1. Prevention or control of hypertensive episodes in the patient with pheochromocytoma. For preoperative reduction of elevated blood pressure, 5 mg of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP (1mg for children) is injected intravenously or intramuscularly 1 or 2 hours before surgery, and repeated if necessary. During surgery, Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP (5 mg for adults, 1 mg for children) is administered intravenously as indicated, to help prevent or control paroxysms of hypertension, tachycardia, respiratory depression, convulsions, or other effects of epinephrine intoxication. (Postoperatively, norepinephrine may be given to control the hypotension that commonly follows complete removal of a pheochromocytoma.) 2. Prevention or treatment of dermal necrosis and sloughing following intravenous administration or extravasation of norepinephrine. For Prevention: 10 mg of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP is added to each liter of solution containing norepinephrine. The pressor effect of norepinephrine is not affected. For Treatment: 5-10 mg of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP in 10 mL of saline is injected into the area of extravasation within 12 hours. 3. Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma \u2014 Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP blocking test. The test is most reliable in detecting pheochromocytoma in patients with sustained hypertension and least reliable in those with paroxysmal hypertension. False-positive tests may occur in patients with hypertension without pheochromocytoma. a. Intravenous Preparation The CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS sections should be reviewed. Sedatives, analgesics, and all other medications except those that might be deemed essential (such as digitalis and insulin) are withheld for at least 24 hours, and preferably 48 -72 hours, prior to the test. Antihypertensive drugs are withheld until blood pressure returns to the untreated, hypertensive level. This test is not performed on a patient who is normotensive. Procedure The patient is kept at rest in the supine position throughout the test, preferably in a quiet, darkened room. Injection of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP is delayed until blood pressure is stabilized, as evidenced by blood pressure readings taken every 10 minutes for at least 30 minutes. Five milligrams of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP is dissolved in 1mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The dose for adults is 5 mg; for children, 1 mg. The syringe needle is inserted into the vein, and injection is delayed until pressor response to venipuncture has subsided. Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP is injected rapidly. Blood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. Interpretation A positive response, suggestive of pheochromocytoma, is indicated when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. Usually, maximal effect is evident within 2 minutes after injection. A return to preinjection pressure commonly occurs within 15-30 minutes but may occur more rapidly. If blood pressure decreases to a dangerous level, the patient should be treated as outlined under OVERDOSAGE . A positive response should always be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures, preferably by measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites. A negative response is indicated when the blood pressure is elevated, unchanged, or reduced less than 35 mmHg, systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic after injection of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP. A negative response to this test does not exclude the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, especially in patients with paroxysmal hypertension in whom the incidence of false-negative responses is high. b. Intramuscular If the intramuscular test for pheochromocytoma is preferred, preparation is the same as for the intravenous test. Five milligrams of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP is then dissolved in 1mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The dose for adults is 5 mg intramuscularly; for children, 3 mg. Blood pressure is recorded every 5 minutes for 30-45 minutes following injection.

Phentolamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from phentolamine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother."

      "OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity No deaths due to acute poisoning with phentolamine have been reported. Oral LD 50 \u2019s (mg/kg): mice, 1000; rats, 1250. Signs and Symptoms Overdosage with phentolamine is characterized chiefly by cardiovascular disturbances, such as arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypotension, and possibly shock. In addition, the following might occur: excitation, headache, sweating, pupillary contraction, visual disturbances; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; hypoglycemia. Treatment There is no specific antidote. A decrease in blood pressure to dangerous levels or other evidence of shocklike conditions should be treated vigorously and promptly. The patient\u2019s legs should be kept raised and a plasma expander should be administered. If necessary, intravenous infusion or norepi-nephrine, titrated to maintain blood pressure at the normotensive level, and all available supportive measures should be included. Epinephrine should not be used, since it may cause a paradoxical reduction in blood pressure."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The reconstituted solution should be used upon preparation and should not be stored. 1. Prevention or control of hypertensive episodes in the patient with pheochromo-cytoma. For preoperative reduction of elevated blood pressure, 5 mg of phentolamine mesylate (1 mg for children) is injected intravenously or intramuscularly 1 or 2 hours before surgery, and repeated if necessary. During surgery, phentolamine mesylate (5 mg for adults, 1 mg for children) is administered intravenously as indicated, to help prevent or control paroxysms of hypertension, tachycardia, respiratory depression, convulsions, or other effects of epinephrine intoxication. (Postoperatively, norepinephrine may be given to control the hypotension that commonly follows complete removal of a pheochromocytoma.) 2. Prevention or treatment of dermal necrosis and sloughing following intravenous administration or extravasation of norepinephrine. For Prevention: 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate is added to each liter of solution containing norepinephrine. The pressor effect of norepinephrine is not affected. For Treatment: 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 mL of saline is injected into the area of extravasation within 12 hours. 3. Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma - phentolamine blocking test . The test is most reliable in detecting pheochromocytoma in patients with sustained hypertension and least reliable in those with paroxysmal hypertension. False-positive tests may occur in patients with hypertension without pheochromocytoma. a. Intravenous Preparation The CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS sections should be reviewed. Sedatives, analgesics, and all other medications except those that might be deemed essential (such as digitalis and insulin) are withheld for at least 24 hours, and preferably 48 to 72 hours, prior to the test. Antihypertensive drugs are withheld until blood pressure returns to the untreated, hypertensive level. This test is not preformed on a patient who is normotensive. Procedure The patient is kept at rest in a supine position throughout the test, preferably in a quiet, darkened room. Injection of phentolamine is delayed until blood pressure is stabilized, as evidenced by blood pressure readings taken every 10 minutes for at least 30 minutes. Five milligrams of phentolamine mesylate is dissolved in 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The dose for adults is 5 mg; for children, 1 mg. The syringe needle is inserted into the vein, and injection is delayed until pressor response to venipuncture has subsided. Phentolamine is injected rapidly. Blood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. Interpretation A positive response, suggestive of pheochromocytoma, is indicated when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mm Hg systolic and 25 mm Hg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mm Hg systolic and 25 mm Hg diastolic. Usually, maximal effect is evident within 2 minutes after injection. A return to preinjection pressure commonly occurs within 15 to 30 minutes but may occur more rapidly. If blood pressure decreases to a dangerous level, the patient should be treated as outlined under OVERDOSAGE . A positive response should always be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures, preferably by measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites. A negative response is indicated when the blood pressure is elevated, unchanged, or reduced less than 35 mm Hg systolic and 25 mm Hg diastolic after injection of phentolamine. A negative response to this test does not exclude the diagnosis of pheo-chromocytoma, especially in patients with paroxysmal hypertension in whom the incidence of false-negative responses is high. b. Intramuscular If the intramuscular test for pheochromocytoma is preferred, preparation is the same as for the intravenous test. Five milligrams of phentolamine mesylate is then dissolved in 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The dose for adults is 5 mg intramuscularly; for children, 3 mg. Blood pressure is recorded every 5 minutes for 30 to 45 minutes following injection. A positive response is indicated when the blood pressure is reduced 35 mm Hg systolic and 25 mm Hg diastolic, or more, within 20 minutes following injection. Note: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."
