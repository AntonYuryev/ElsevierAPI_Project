    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral inhalation only. Two inhalations of STIOLTO RESPIMAT once-daily at the same time of day. ( 2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT is two inhalations once-daily at the same time of the day. Do not use STIOLTO RESPIMAT more than two inhalations every 24 hours. 2.2 Administration Information For oral inhalation only. Prior to first use, the STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. When using the unit for the first time, patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . No dosage adjustment is required for geriatric, hepatically-impaired, or renally-impaired patients. However, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment given STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6 , 8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS LABA as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increases the risk of serious asthma-related events. ( 5.1 ) Do not initiate STIOLTO RESPIMAT in acutely deteriorating COPD patients. ( 5.2 ) Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta 2 -agonists can be used as needed for acute relief. ( 5.2 ) Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Excessive use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal. ( 5.3 ) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. ( 5.4 ) Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT immediately. ( 5.5 ) Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs. ( 5.6 , 5.7 ) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.8 ) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.9 ) Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Serious Asthma-Related Events \u2013 Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death The safety and efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Contraindications (4) ] . Use of long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA) as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone. A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including olodaterol, one of the active ingredients in STIOLTO RESPIMAT. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT has been conducted. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD. 5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate. STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonist. When beginning STIOLTO RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing STIOLTO RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta 2 -agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated. COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STIOLTO RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta 2 -agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dosage is not appropriate in this situation. 5.3 Excessive Use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT and Use With Other Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists As with other inhaled drugs containing beta 2 -adrenergic agents, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta 2 -agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. 5.4 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching may occur after administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to STIOLTO RESPIMAT. 5.5 Paradoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may cause paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 5.6 Cardiovascular Effects Olodaterol, like other beta 2 -agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. 5.7 Coexisting Conditions Olodaterol, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QT interval, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta 2 -agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. 5.8 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.9 Worsening of Urinary Retention STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.10 Renal Impairment Because tiotropium is a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.11 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta 2 -adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalemia may be potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] , which may increase the susceptibility for cardiac arrhythmias. Clinically notable decreases in serum potassium or changes in blood glucose were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of olodaterol with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. Olodaterol has not been investigated in patients whose diabetes mellitus is not well controlled."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS LABA, such as olodaterol, one of the active components in STIOLTO RESPIMAT, as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma, increase the risk of asthma-related events. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Warning and Precautions (5.1) ]. The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most common adverse reactions (>3% incidence and more than an active control) were nasopharyngitis, cough, and back pain. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. The clinical program for STIOLTO RESPIMAT included 7,151 subjects with COPD in two 52-week active-controlled trials, one 12-week placebo-controlled trial, three 6-week placebo-controlled cross-over trials, and four additional trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,988 subjects received at least 1 dose of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Adverse reactions observed in the \u226412-week trials were consistent with those observed in the 52-week trials, which formed the primary safety database. The primary safety database consisted of pooled data from the two 52-week double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group confirmatory clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2). These trials included 5,162 adult COPD patients (72.9% males and 27.1% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 1,029 were treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT once daily. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasians (71.1%) with a mean age of 63.8 years and a mean percent predicted FEV 1 at baseline of 43.2%. In these two trials, tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg were included as active control arms and no placebo was used. In these two clinical trials, 74% of patients exposed to STIOLTO RESPIMAT reported an adverse reaction compared to 76.6% and 73.3% in the olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg groups, respectively. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 7.4% for STIOLTO RESPIMAT treated patients compared to 9.9% and 9.0% for olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg treated patients. The adverse reaction most commonly leading to discontinuation was worsening COPD. The most common serious adverse reactions were COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. Table 1 shows all adverse drug reactions that occurred with an incidence of >3% in the STIOLTO RESPIMAT treatment group and a higher incidence rate than the active comparator groups listed.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other adrenergic drugs may potentiate effect. Use with caution. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution. ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and drugs that prolong QTc interval may potentiate effect on cardiovascular system. Use with extreme caution. ( 7.4 ) Beta-blockers may decrease effectiveness. Use with caution and only when medically necessary. ( 7.5 ) Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Adrenergic Drugs If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the sympathetic effects of olodaterol, one component of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.6 , 5.10 , 5.11) ] . 7.2 Sympathomimetics, Xanthine Derivatives, Steroids, or Diuretics Tiotropium has been used concomitantly with short-acting and long-acting sympathomimetic (beta-agonists) bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids, without increases in adverse reactions. Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of olodaterol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 7.3 Non-Potassium Sparing Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dosage of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT with non-potassium sparing diuretics. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Tricyclic Antidepressants, QTc Prolonging Drugs STIOLTO RESPIMAT, as with other drugs containing beta 2 -agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval may be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 7.5 Beta-Blockers Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and the olodaterol component of STIOLTO RESPIMAT may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. 7.6 Anticholinergics There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid co-administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 , 5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 7.7 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 and P-gp Efflux Transporter In a drug interaction study using the strong dual CYP and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, a 1.7-fold increase of olodaterol maximum plasma concentrations and AUC was observed [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ] . Olodaterol was evaluated in clinical trials for up to one year at doses up to twice the recommended therapeutic dosage. No dosage adjustment of STIOLTO RESPIMAT is necessary."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for potential anticholinergic side effects. ( 2 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies with STIOLTO RESPIMAT or its individual components, tiotropium bromide and olodaterol, in pregnant women to inform of drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. Animal reproduction studies were conducted with the individual components of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, tiotropium bromide and olodaterol. There are clinical considerations with the use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ) . STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Based on animal reproduction studies, no structural abnormalities were observed when tiotropium was administered by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 790 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in rats and rabbits administered tiotropium at maternally toxic doses 430 times and 40 times the MRHDID, respectively (see Data ) . Based on animal studies, olodaterol was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats or rabbits during organogenesis at inhalation doses of approximately 2,731 or 1,353 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis), in rats or rabbits, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery There are no adequate and well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of STIOLTO RESPIMAT on preterm labor or labor at term. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies with the combination of tiotropium and olodaterol are not available; however, studies are available with the individual components. Tiotropium In 2 separate embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received tiotropium during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 790 and 8 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 1,471 and 7 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). No evidence of structural abnormalities was observed in rats or rabbits. However, in rats, tiotropium caused fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and the mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation at tiotropium doses of approximately 40 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 78 mcg/kg/day). In rabbits, tiotropium caused an increase in post-implantation loss at a tiotropium dose of approximately 430 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 400 mcg/kg/day). Such effects were not observed at approximately 5 and 95 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 9 and 88 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). Olodaterol Olodaterol was not teratogenic in rats at inhalation doses approximately 2,731 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 1,054 mcg/kg/day). No significant effects occurred in rabbits at inhalation doses approximately 1,353 times the MRHDID in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 974 mcg/kg/day). Placental transfer of olodaterol was observed in pregnant rats. Olodaterol has been shown to be teratogenic in New Zealand rabbits at inhalation doses approximately 7,130 times the MRHDID in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 2,489 mcg/kg/day). Olodaterol exhibited the following fetal toxicities: enlarged or small heart atria or ventricles, eye abnormalities, and split or distorted sternum. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiotropium or olodaterol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tiotropium, olodaterol, and/or their metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats, however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear (see Data ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for STIOLTO RESPIMAT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from STIOLTO RESPIMAT or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The distributions of tiotropium bromide or olodaterol into milk were investigated in separate studies after a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg or 0.4 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively, to lactating rats. Tiotropium, olodaterol, and/or their metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations above those in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use COPD does not normally occur in children. The safety and effectiveness of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in the pediatric population has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Based on available data, no adjustment of STIOLTO RESPIMAT dosage in geriatric patients is warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Of the 1,029 patients who received STIOLTO RESPIMAT at the recommended dose once daily in the clinical studies from the pooled 1-year database, 525 (51.0%) were <65 years of age, 407 (39.6%) were 65 to <75, 96 (9.3%) were 75 to <85, and 1 (0.1%) was \u226585. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed, and in the 1-year pooled data, the adverse drug reaction profiles were similar in the older population compared to the patient population overall. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. A study in subjects with severe hepatic impairment was not performed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. However, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies with STIOLTO RESPIMAT or its individual components, tiotropium bromide and olodaterol, in pregnant women to inform of drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. Animal reproduction studies were conducted with the individual components of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, tiotropium bromide and olodaterol. There are clinical considerations with the use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ) . STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Based on animal reproduction studies, no structural abnormalities were observed when tiotropium was administered by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 790 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in rats and rabbits administered tiotropium at maternally toxic doses 430 times and 40 times the MRHDID, respectively (see Data ) . Based on animal studies, olodaterol was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats or rabbits during organogenesis at inhalation doses of approximately 2,731 or 1,353 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis), in rats or rabbits, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery There are no adequate and well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of STIOLTO RESPIMAT on preterm labor or labor at term. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies with the combination of tiotropium and olodaterol are not available; however, studies are available with the individual components. Tiotropium In 2 separate embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received tiotropium during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 790 and 8 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 1,471 and 7 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). No evidence of structural abnormalities was observed in rats or rabbits. However, in rats, tiotropium caused fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and the mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation at tiotropium doses of approximately 40 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 78 mcg/kg/day). In rabbits, tiotropium caused an increase in post-implantation loss at a tiotropium dose of approximately 430 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 400 mcg/kg/day). Such effects were not observed at approximately 5 and 95 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 9 and 88 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). Olodaterol Olodaterol was not teratogenic in rats at inhalation doses approximately 2,731 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 1,054 mcg/kg/day). No significant effects occurred in rabbits at inhalation doses approximately 1,353 times the MRHDID in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 974 mcg/kg/day). Placental transfer of olodaterol was observed in pregnant rats. Olodaterol has been shown to be teratogenic in New Zealand rabbits at inhalation doses approximately 7,130 times the MRHDID in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 2,489 mcg/kg/day). Olodaterol exhibited the following fetal toxicities: enlarged or small heart atria or ventricles, eye abnormalities, and split or distorted sternum."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE STIOLTO RESPIMAT contains both tiotropium bromide and olodaterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Tiotropium High doses of tiotropium may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms. However, there were no systemic anticholinergic adverse effects following a single inhaled dose of up to 282 mcg tiotropium in 6 healthy volunteers. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, bilateral conjunctivitis and dry mouth were seen following repeated once-daily inhalation of 141 mcg of tiotropium. Dry mouth/throat and dry nasal mucosa occurred in a dose-dependent [10-40 mcg daily] manner, were observed following 14-day dosing of up to 40 mcg tiotropium bromide inhalation solution in healthy subjects. Olodaterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of olodaterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms, e.g., myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, headache, tremor, dry mouth, muscle spasms, nausea, fatigue, malaise, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of olodaterol. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of STIOLTO RESPIMAT together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION STIOLTO RESPIMAT is a combination of tiotropium, an anticholinergic, and olodaterol, a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA). The drug substance tiotropium bromide monohydrate is chemically described as (1\u03b1, 2\u00df, 4\u00df, 5\u03b1, 7\u00df)-7-[(Hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ] nonane bromide monohydrate. It is a synthetic, non-chiral, quaternary ammonium compound. Tiotropium bromide is a white or yellowish white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in methanol. The structural formula is: Tiotropium bromide (monohydrate) has a molecular mass of 490.4 and a molecular formula of C 19 H 22 NO 4 S 2 Br \u2219 H 2 O. The drug substance olodaterol hydrochloride is chemically described as 2H-1,4-Benzoxazin-3H(4H)-one, 6-hydroxy-8-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,1-dimethylethyl]-amino]ethyl]-, monohydrochloride. Olodaterol hydrochloride is a white to off-white powder that is sparingly-slightly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. The molecular weight is 422.9 g/mole (salt): 386.5 g/mole (base), and the molecular formula is C 21 H 26 N 2 O 5 \u00d7 HCl as a hydrochloride. The conversion factor from salt to free base is 1.094. The structural formula is: The drug product, STIOLTO RESPIMAT, is composed of a sterile aqueous solution of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol hydrochloride filled into a 4.5 mL plastic container crimped into an aluminum cylinder (STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge) for use with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. Excipients include, benzalkonium chloride, edetate disodium, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge is only intended for use with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler is a hand held, pocket sized oral inhalation device that uses mechanical energy to generate a slow-moving aerosol cloud of medication from a metered volume of the drug solution. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler has a light green-colored cap. When used with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler each cartridge, containing 4 grams of sterile aqueous solution, delivers the labeled number of metered actuations after preparation for use. Each dose (one dose equals two actuations) from the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler delivers 5 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 6.247 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate) and 5 mcg olodaterol (equivalent to 5.473 mcg olodaterol hydrochloride) in 22.1 mcL from the mouthpiece. As with all inhaled drugs, the actual amount of drug delivered to the lung may depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between the actuation of the inhaler and inspiration through the delivery system. The duration of inspiration should be at least as long as the spray duration (1.5 seconds). Chemical Structure Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action STIOLTO RESPIMAT STIOLTO RESPIMAT contains both tiotropium and olodaterol. The properties described below for the individual components apply to STIOLTO RESPIMAT. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medication (an anticholinergic and a beta-agonist) that have different effects on clinical and physiological indices. Tiotropium Tiotropium is a long-acting, muscarinic antagonist which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect. Olodaterol Olodaterol is a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA). The compound exerts its pharmacological effects by binding and activation of beta 2 -adrenoceptors after topical administration by inhalation. Activation of these receptors in the airways results in a stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that mediates the synthesis of cyclic-3', 5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Elevated levels of cAMP induce bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscle cells. In vitro studies have shown that olodaterol has 241-fold greater agonist activity at beta 2 -adrenoceptors compared to beta 1 -adrenoceptors and 2,299-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta 3 -adrenoceptors. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Beta-adrenoceptors are divided into three subtypes: beta 1 -adrenoceptors predominantly expressed on cardiac muscle, beta 2 -adrenoceptors predominantly expressed on airway smooth muscle, and beta 3 -adrenoceptors predominantly expressed on adipose tissue. Beta 2 -agonists cause bronchodilation. Although the beta 2 -adrenoceptor is the predominant adrenergic receptor in the airway smooth muscle, it is also present on the surface of a variety of other cells, including lung epithelial and endothelial cells and in the heart. The precise function of beta 2 -receptors in the heart is not known, but their presence raises the possibility that even highly selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology STIOLTO RESPIMAT In two 52-week randomized, double-blind trials using STIOLTO RESPIMAT that enrolled 5,162 patients with COPD, ECG assessments were performed post-dose on days 1, 85, 169, and 365. In a pooled analysis the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of >30 msec using both the Bazett (QTcB) and Fredericia (QTcF), corrections of QT for heart rate were not different for the STIOLTO RESPIMAT group compared to olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg across the assessments conducted. Tiotropium The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium inhalation powder 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium inhalation powder 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30\u201360 msec was higher in the tiotropium group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical trials with tiotropium did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. Olodaterol The effect of olodaterol on the QT/QTc interval of the ECG was investigated in 24 healthy male and female volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active (moxifloxacin)- controlled study at single doses of 10, 20, 30, and 50 mcg. Dose-dependent QtcI (individual subject corrected QT interval) prolongation was observed. The maximum mean (one-sided 95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcI from placebo after baseline correction was 2.5 (5.6) ms, 6.1 (9.2) ms, 7.5 (10.7) ms, and 8.5 (11.6) ms following doses of 10, 20, 30, and 50 mcg, respectively. The effect of 5 mcg and 10 mcg olodaterol on heart rate and rhythm was assessed using continuous 24-hour ECG recording (Holter monitoring) in a subset of 772 patients in the 48-week, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials. There were no dose- or time-related trends or patterns observed for the magnitudes of mean changes in heart rate or premature beats. Shifts from baseline to the end of treatment in premature beats did not indicate meaningful differences between olodaterol 5 mcg, 10 mcg, and placebo. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics STIOLTO RESPIMAT When STIOLTO RESPIMAT was administered by the inhalation route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for tiotropium and for olodaterol were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately. Tiotropium Tiotropium is administered as an inhalation spray. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. Olodaterol Olodaterol showed linear pharmacokinetics. On repeated once-daily inhalation, steady-state of olodaterol plasma concentrations was achieved after 8 days, and the extent of exposure was increased up to 1.8-fold as compared to a single dose. Absorption Tiotropium Following inhalation of the solution by young healthy volunteers, urinary excretion data suggests that approximately 33% of the inhaled dose reaches the systemic circulation. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2% to 3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium for the same reason. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 5 to 7 minutes after inhalation. Olodaterol Olodaterol reaches maximum plasma concentrations generally within 10 to 20 minutes following drug inhalation. In healthy volunteers the absolute bioavailability of olodaterol following inhalation was estimated to be approximately 30%, whereas the absolute bioavailability was below 1% when given as an oral solution. Thus, the systemic availability of olodaterol after inhalation is mainly determined by lung absorption, while any swallowed portion of the dose only negligibly contributes to systemic exposure. Distribution Tiotropium The drug has a plasma protein binding of 72% and shows a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Olodaterol Olodaterol exhibits multi-compartmental disposition kinetics after inhalation as well as after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution is high (1,110 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissue. In vitro binding of [ 14 C] olodaterol to human plasma proteins is independent of concentration and is approximately 60%. Elimination Metabolism Tiotropium The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, both not binding to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase 2 metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Olodaterol Olodaterol is substantially metabolized by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation at the methoxy moiety followed by conjugation. Of the six metabolites identified, only the unconjugated demethylation product binds to beta 2 -receptors. This metabolite, however, is not detectable in plasma after chronic inhalation of the recommended therapeutic dose. Cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, with negligible contribution of CYP3A4, are involved in the O-demethylation of olodaterol, while uridine diphosphate glycosyl transferase isoforms UGT2B7, UGT1A1, 1A7, and 1A9 were shown to be involved in the formation of olodaterol glucuronides. Excretion Tiotropium The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after an intravenous dose in young healthy volunteers. Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After inhalation of the solution by patients with COPD, urinary excretion is 18.6% (0.932 mcg) of the dose, the remainder being mainly non-absorbed drug in the gut that is eliminated via the feces. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. After chronic once-daily inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Olodaterol Total clearance of olodaterol in healthy volunteers is 872 mL/min, and renal clearance is 173 mL/min. The terminal half-life following intravenous administration is 22 hours. The terminal half-life following inhalation in contrast is about 45 hours, indicating that the latter is determined by absorption rather than by elimination processes. However, the effective half-life at daily dose of 5 mcg calculated from C max from COPD patients is 7.5 hours. Following intravenous administration of [ 14 C]-labeled olodaterol, 38% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and 53% was recovered in feces. The amount of unchanged olodaterol recovered in the urine after intravenous administration was 19%. Following oral administration, only 9% of olodaterol and/or its metabolites was recovered in urine, while the major portion was recovered in feces (84%). More than 90% of the dose was excreted within 6 and 5 days following intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Following inhalation, excretion of unchanged olodaterol in urine within the dosing interval in healthy volunteers at steady state accounted for 5% to 7% of the dose. Drug Interactions STIOLTO RESPIMAT Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with STIOLTO RESPIMAT have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with individual components tiotropium and olodaterol. When tiotropium and olodaterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for each component were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately. Tiotropium An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once-daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium. Olodaterol Drug-drug interaction studies were carried out using fluconazole as a model inhibitor of CYP 2C9 and ketoconazole as a potent P-gp (and CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9) inhibitor. Fluconazole : Co-administration of 400 mg fluconazole once a day for 14 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol. Ketoconazole : Co-administration of 400 mg ketoconazole once a day for 14 days increased olodaterol C max by 66% and AUC 0-1 by 68%. Tiotropium : Co-administration of tiotropium bromide, delivered as a fixed-dose combination with olodaterol, for 21 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol, and vice versa. Specific Populations Olodaterol A pharmacokinetic meta-analysis showed that no dose adjustment is necessary based on the effect of age, gender, and weight on systemic exposure in COPD patients after inhalation of olodaterol. Geriatric Patients Tiotropium: As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (347 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 275 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values. Renal Impairment Tiotropium Following inhaled administration of therapeutic doses of tiotropium to steady-state to patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 - <90 mL/min) resulted in 23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 17% higher C max,ss values. Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - <60 mL/min) resulted in 57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). In COPD patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min), a single intravenous administration of tiotropium bromide resulted in 94% higher AUC 0-4 and 52% higher C max compared to COPD patients with normal renal function. Olodaterol Olodaterol levels were increased by approximately 40% in subjects with severe renal impairment. A study in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment was not performed. Hepatic Impairment Tiotropium The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Olodaterol Subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no changes in C max or AUC, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatically impaired subjects and their healthy controls. A study in subjects with severe hepatic impairment was not performed."

Shifts from baseline to the end of treatment in premature beats did not indicate meaningful differences between olodaterol 5 mcg, 10 mcg, and placebo."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics STIOLTO RESPIMAT When STIOLTO RESPIMAT was administered by the inhalation route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for tiotropium and for olodaterol were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately. Tiotropium Tiotropium is administered as an inhalation spray. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. Olodaterol Olodaterol showed linear pharmacokinetics. On repeated once-daily inhalation, steady-state of olodaterol plasma concentrations was achieved after 8 days, and the extent of exposure was increased up to 1.8-fold as compared to a single dose. Absorption Tiotropium Following inhalation of the solution by young healthy volunteers, urinary excretion data suggests that approximately 33% of the inhaled dose reaches the systemic circulation. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2% to 3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium for the same reason. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 5 to 7 minutes after inhalation. Olodaterol Olodaterol reaches maximum plasma concentrations generally within 10 to 20 minutes following drug inhalation. In healthy volunteers the absolute bioavailability of olodaterol following inhalation was estimated to be approximately 30%, whereas the absolute bioavailability was below 1% when given as an oral solution. Thus, the systemic availability of olodaterol after inhalation is mainly determined by lung absorption, while any swallowed portion of the dose only negligibly contributes to systemic exposure. Distribution Tiotropium The drug has a plasma protein binding of 72% and shows a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Olodaterol Olodaterol exhibits multi-compartmental disposition kinetics after inhalation as well as after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution is high (1,110 L), suggesting extensive distribution into tissue. In vitro binding of [ 14 C] olodaterol to human plasma proteins is independent of concentration and is approximately 60%. Elimination Metabolism Tiotropium The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, both not binding to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase 2 metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Olodaterol Olodaterol is substantially metabolized by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation at the methoxy moiety followed by conjugation. Of the six metabolites identified, only the unconjugated demethylation product binds to beta 2 -receptors. This metabolite, however, is not detectable in plasma after chronic inhalation of the recommended therapeutic dose. Cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, with negligible contribution of CYP3A4, are involved in the O-demethylation of olodaterol, while uridine diphosphate glycosyl transferase isoforms UGT2B7, UGT1A1, 1A7, and 1A9 were shown to be involved in the formation of olodaterol glucuronides. Excretion Tiotropium The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after an intravenous dose in young healthy volunteers. Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After inhalation of the solution by patients with COPD, urinary excretion is 18.6% (0.932 mcg) of the dose, the remainder being mainly non-absorbed drug in the gut that is eliminated via the feces. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. After chronic once-daily inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Olodaterol Total clearance of olodaterol in healthy volunteers is 872 mL/min, and renal clearance is 173 mL/min. The terminal half-life following intravenous administration is 22 hours. The terminal half-life following inhalation in contrast is about 45 hours, indicating that the latter is determined by absorption rather than by elimination processes. However, the effective half-life at daily dose of 5 mcg calculated from C max from COPD patients is 7.5 hours. Following intravenous administration of [ 14 C]-labeled olodaterol, 38% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and 53% was recovered in feces. The amount of unchanged olodaterol recovered in the urine after intravenous administration was 19%. Following oral administration, only 9% of olodaterol and/or its metabolites was recovered in urine, while the major portion was recovered in feces (84%). More than 90% of the dose was excreted within 6 and 5 days following intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Following inhalation, excretion of unchanged olodaterol in urine within the dosing interval in healthy volunteers at steady state accounted for 5% to 7% of the dose. Drug Interactions STIOLTO RESPIMAT Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with STIOLTO RESPIMAT have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with individual components tiotropium and olodaterol. When tiotropium and olodaterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for each component were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately. Tiotropium An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once-daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium. Olodaterol Drug-drug interaction studies were carried out using fluconazole as a model inhibitor of CYP 2C9 and ketoconazole as a potent P-gp (and CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9) inhibitor. Fluconazole : Co-administration of 400 mg fluconazole once a day for 14 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol. Ketoconazole : Co-administration of 400 mg ketoconazole once a day for 14 days increased olodaterol C max by 66% and AUC 0-1 by 68%. Tiotropium : Co-administration of tiotropium bromide, delivered as a fixed-dose combination with olodaterol, for 21 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol, and vice versa. Specific Populations Olodaterol A pharmacokinetic meta-analysis showed that no dose adjustment is necessary based on the effect of age, gender, and weight on systemic exposure in COPD patients after inhalation of olodaterol. Geriatric Patients Tiotropium: As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (347 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 275 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values. Renal Impairment Tiotropium Following inhaled administration of therapeutic doses of tiotropium to steady-state to patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 - <90 mL/min) resulted in 23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 17% higher C max,ss values. Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - <60 mL/min) resulted in 57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). In COPD patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min), a single intravenous administration of tiotropium bromide resulted in 94% higher AUC 0-4 and 52% higher C max compared to COPD patients with normal renal function. Olodaterol Olodaterol levels were increased by approximately 40% in subjects with severe renal impairment. A study in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment was not performed. Hepatic Impairment Tiotropium The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Olodaterol Subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no changes in C max or AUC, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatically impaired subjects and their healthy controls. A study in subjects with severe hepatic impairment was not performed."

Tiotropium No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in a 104-week inhalation study in rats at tiotropium doses up to 59 mcg/kg/day, in an 83-week inhalation study in female mice at doses up to 145 mcg/kg/day, and in a 101-week inhalation study in male mice at doses up to 2 mcg/kg/day. These doses correspond to approximately 30, 40, and 0.5 times the recommended human daily inhalation dose (RHDID) on a mcg/m 2 basis, respectively. Tiotropium bromide demonstrated no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity in the following assays: the bacterial gene mutation assay, the V79 Chinese hamster cell mutagenesis assay, the chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes in vitro , the mouse micronucleus assay in vivo , and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in primary rat hepatocytes in vitro . In rats, decreases in the number of corpora lutea and the percentage of implants were noted at inhalation tiotropium doses of 78 mcg/kg/day or greater (approximately 35 times the RHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis). No such effects were observed at 9 mcg/kg/day (approximately 4 times than the RHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis). The fertility index; however, was not affected at inhalation doses up to 1,689 mg/kg/day (approximately 760 times the RHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis). Olodaterol Two-year inhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice to assess the carcinogenic potential of olodaterol. Lifetime treatment of female rats induced leiomyomas of the mesovarium at doses of 25.8 and 270 mcg/kg/day (approximately 18- and 198-fold, respectively, the RHDID on an AUC basis). No tumor findings were observed in male rats at doses up to 270 mcg/kg/day (approximately 230-fold the RHDID on an AUC basis). Lifetime treatment of female mice induced leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas of the uterus at doses \u226576.9 mcg/kg/day (approximately 106-fold the RHDID on an AUC basis). No tumor findings were observed in male mice at doses up to 255 mcg/kg/day (approximately 455-fold the RHDID on an AUC basis). Increases in leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas of the female rodent reproductive tract have been similarly demonstrated with other beta 2 -adrenergic agonist drugs. The relevance of these findings to human use is unknown. Olodaterol was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames test or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay. Olodaterol produced increased frequency of micronuclei in rats after intravenous doses. The increased frequency of micronuclei was likely related to drug enhanced (compensatory) erythropoiesis. The mechanism for induction of micronuclei formation is likely not relevant at clinical exposures. Olodaterol did not impair male or female fertility in rats at inhalation doses up to 3,068 mcg/kg/day (approximately 2,322 times the RHDID on an AUC basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT were evaluated in a clinical development program that included three dose ranging trials, two active-controlled trials, three active- and placebo-controlled trials, and one placebo-controlled trial. The efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT is based primarily on two 4-week dose-ranging trials in 592 COPD patients and two confirmatory active-controlled 52-week trials (Trials 1 and 2) in 5,162 COPD patients. Dose-Ranging Trials Dose selection for STIOLTO RESPIMAT was primarily based on trials for the individual components, tiotropium bromide and olodaterol. Dose selection was also supported by two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 4-week trials. In one trial in 232 patients with COPD, three tiotropium doses (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mcg) were given in combination with olodaterol 5 or 10 mcg and were evaluated compared to olodaterol monotherapy. Results demonstrated improvement in trough FEV 1 for the combination when compared to olodaterol alone. The difference in trough FEV 1 for the tiotropium bromide/olodaterol doses of 1.25/5, 2.5/5, and 5/5 mcg once daily from olodaterol 5 mcg were 0.054 L (95% CI 0.016, 0.092), 0.065 L (0.027, 0.103), and 0.084 L (0.046, 0.122), respectively. In the second trial in 360 patients with COPD, three olodaterol doses (2, 5, and 10 mcg) were given in combination with tiotropium 5 mcg and were evaluated compared to tiotropium monotherapy. The difference in trough FEV 1 for the tiotropium/olodaterol doses of 5/2, 5/5, and 5/10 mcg once daily from tiotropium 5 mcg were 0.024 L (95% CI -0.029, 0.076), 0.033 L (-0.019, 0.085), and 0.057 L (0.004, 0.110), respectively. Results of these trials supported the evaluation of once-daily doses of tiotropium bromide/olodaterol 2.5/5 mcg and 5/5 mcg in the confirmatory trials. Confirmatory Trials A total of 5,162 COPD patients (1,029 receiving STIOLTO RESPIMAT, 1,038 receiving olodaterol 5 mcg, and 1,033 receiving tiotropium bromide 5 mcg) were studied in two confirmatory trials of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Trials 1 and 2 were 52-week, replicate, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, parallel group trials that compared STIOLTO RESPIMAT to tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg. In these trials, all products were administered via the RESPIMAT inhaler. The trials enrolled patients 40 years of age or older with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years, and moderate to very severe pulmonary impairment (post-bronchodilator FEV 1 less than 80% predicted normal [GOLD Stage 2-4]; post-bronchodilator FEV 1 to FVC ratio of less than 70%). All treatments were administered once daily in the morning. The primary endpoints were change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-3hr and trough FEV 1 after 24 weeks of treatment. The majority of the 5162 patients were male (73%), white (71%) or Asian (25%), with a mean age of 64.0 years. Mean post-bronchodilator FEV 1 was 1.37 L (GOLD 2 [50%], GOLD 3 [39%], GOLD 4 [11%]). Mean beta 2 -agonist responsiveness was 16.6% of baseline (0.171 L). Pulmonary medications allowed as concomitant therapy included inhaled steroids [47%] and xanthines [10%]. In both Trials 1 and 2, STIOLTO RESPIMAT demonstrated significant improvements in FEV 1 AUC 0-3hr and trough FEV 1 after 24 weeks compared to tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg (Table 2). The increased bronchodilator effects of STIOLTO RESPIMAT compared to tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg were maintained throughout the 52-week treatment period. STIOLTO RESPIMAT displayed a mean increase in FEV 1 from baseline of 0.137 L (range: 0.133-0.140 L) within 5 minutes after the first dose. Patients treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT used less rescue medication compared to patients treated with tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg.

Results from Trial 2 are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 FEV 1 profile for STIOLTO RESPIMAT, tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg over a 24-hour dosing interval after 24 weeks (12 hr PFT subset from Trial 2) The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was assessed in Trials 1 and 2 and in two additional 12-week placebo-controlled trials (Trials 3 and 4). In the first 12-week trial, SGRQ responder rates at week 12 (defined as an improvement in score of 4 or more as a threshold) were 53%, 42%, and 31% for STIOLTO RESPIMAT, tiotropium 5 mcg, and placebo, respectively, with odds ratios of 1.6 (95% CI 1.1, 2.4) and 2.5 (95% CI 1.6, 3.8) for STIOLTO RESPIMAT vs. tiotropium 5 mcg and STIOLTO RESPIMAT vs. placebo, respectively. In the second 12-week trial, results were similar with odds ratios of 1.5 (95% CI 1.0, 2.3) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.5, 3.4) for STIOLTO RESPIMAT vs. tiotropium 5 mcg and STIOLTO RESPIMAT vs. placebo, respectively. For the 52-week trials similar responder rates were seen. In Trial 1, the odds ratios for STIOLTO vs. tiotropium 5 mcg and STIOLTO vs. olodaterol 5 mcg at week 24 were 1.6 (95% CI 1.2, 2.0) and 1.9 (95% CI 1.5, 2.4), respectively. The results were similar in the 52-week Trial 2, with odds ratios for STIOLTO vs. tiotropium 5 mcg and STIOLTO vs. olodaterol 5 mcg of 1.3 (95% CI 1.0, 1.7) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.1, 1.9), respectively. Exacerbations Tiotropium 5 mcg Trials Evaluating Exacerbations The effect of tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray on exacerbations was evaluated in three 48-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that included COPD exacerbations as the primary endpoint. Exacerbations of COPD were defined as a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underlying COPD, with duration of three days or more, requiring a prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids and/or hospitalization. In a pooled analysis of the first two trials, tiotropium 5 mcg significantly reduced the number of COPD exacerbations compared to placebo with a rate ratio of 0.78 (95% CI 0.67, 0.92). In the third trial, tiotropium 5 mcg delayed the time to first COPD exacerbation compared to placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.63, 0.77). STIOLTO RESPIMAT Trial Evaluating Exacerbations In a one-year, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled parallel group clinical trial (Trial 5), the effect of STIOLTO RESPIMAT on COPD exacerbations was compared with tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray. Exacerbations were defined as above. Enrolled patients (3,939 patients receiving STIOLTO RESPIMAT and 3,941 patients receiving tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray) had a history of COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months. The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations. The majority of patients were male (71%) and Caucasian (79%). The mean age was 66 years, and mean post-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted was 45%. STIOLTO RESPIMAT treatment did not demonstrate superiority to tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray for the primary endpoint, the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations, with a rate ratio of 0.93 (99% CI, 0.85-1.02, p=0.0498). The study did not reach the pre-specified significance level of 0.01. Figure 1"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Serious Asthma-Related Events Inform patients that LABA, such as STIOLTO RESPIMAT, when used as monotherapy [without an inhaled corticosteroid], increase the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. Not for Acute Symptoms STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. (The healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used.) Instruct patients to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: Worsening of symptoms Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician Instruct patients not to stop therapy with STIOLTO RESPIMAT without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. Do Not Use Additional Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists Patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists on a regular basis should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these products and use them only for the symptomatic relief of acute symptoms. When patients are prescribed STIOLTO RESPIMAT, other inhaled medications containing long-acting beta 2 -agonists should not be used. Patients should not use more than the recommended once-daily dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Excessive use of sympathomimetics may cause significant cardiovascular effects, and may be fatal. Risks Associated with Beta 2 -Agonist Therapy Inform patients of adverse effects associated with beta 2 -agonists, such as palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, or nervousness. Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, may occur after administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Advise patient to immediately discontinue treatment and consult a physician should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inform patients that STIOLTO RESPIMAT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Advise patients that if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, patients should discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Urinary Retention Difficulty passing urine and dysuria may be symptoms of new or worsening prostatic hyperplasia or bladder outlet obstruction. Patients should be instructed to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Visual Effects Eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema may be signs of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. Inform patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs and symptoms develop. Advise patients that miotic eye drops alone are not considered to be effective treatment. Inform patients that care must be taken not to allow the aerosol cloud to enter into the eyes as this may cause blurring of vision and pupil dilation. Since dizziness and blurred vision may occur with the use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, caution patients about engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Instructions for Administering STIOLTO RESPIMAT It is important for patients to understand how to correctly administer STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhalation spray using the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. Instruct patients that STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhalation spray should only be administered via the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler and the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler should not be used for administering other medications. Instruct patients that priming STIOLTO RESPIMAT is essential to ensure appropriate content of the medication in each actuation. When using the unit for the first time, the STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. STIOLTO RESPIMAT patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then to repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use ."

Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to tiotropium bromide inhalation powder. In addition, tiotropium bromide inhalation powder should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. 5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled medicines, including tiotropium bromide inhalation powder, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled short- acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. Treatment with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder should be stopped and other treatments considered. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.6 Renal Impairment As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reactions (>5% incidence in the 1-year placebo- controlled trials) were upper respiratory tract infection, dry mouth, sinusitis, pharyngitis, non-specific chest pain, urinary tract infection, dyspepsia, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. 6-Month to 1-Year Trials The data described below reflect exposure to tiotropium bromide inhalation powder in 2,663 patients. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1,308 patients were treated with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran's Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected. The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention. Four multicenter, 1-year, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials evaluated tiotropium bromide inhalation powder in patients with COPD. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of \u22653% in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials where the rates in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group exceeded placebo by \u22651%. The frequency of corresponding reactions in the ipratropium-controlled trials is included for comparison.

Other reactions that occurred in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group at a frequency of 1% to 3% in the placebo-controlled trials where the rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Body as a Whole : allergic reaction, leg pain; Central and Peripheral Nervous System : dysphonia, paresthesia; Gastrointestinal System Disorders : gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), gastroesophageal reflux, stomatitis (including ulcerative stomatitis); Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia; Musculoskeletal System Disorders : skeletal pain; Cardiac Events : angina pectoris (including aggravated angina pectoris); Psychiatric Disorder : depression; Infections : herpes zoster; Respiratory System Disorder (Upper): laryngitis; Vision Disorder : cataract. In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% were atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, angioedema, and urinary retention. In the 1-year trials, the incidence of dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection increased with age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Two multicenter, 6-month, controlled studies evaluated tiotropium bromide inhalation powder in patients with COPD. The adverse reactions and the incidence rates were similar to those seen in the 1-year controlled trials. 4-Year Trial The data described below reflect exposure to tiotropium bromide inhalation powder in 5,992 COPD patients in a 4-year placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, 2,986 patients were treated with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age range from 40 to 88 years, was 75% male, 90% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 40%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. When the adverse reactions were analyzed with a frequency of \u22653% in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group where the rates in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group exceeded placebo by \u22651%, adverse reactions included (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder, placebo): pharyngitis (12.5%, 10.8%), sinusitis (6.5%, 5.3%), headache (5.7%, 4.5%), constipation (5.1%, 3.7%), dry mouth (5.1%, 2.7%), depression (4.4%, 3.3%), insomnia (4.4%, 3.0%), and arthralgia (4.2%, 3.1%). Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed that were reported more frequently in COPD patients treated with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder than placebo include: dehydration, skin ulcer, stomatitis, gingivitis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dry skin, skin infection, and joint swelling. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for potential anticholinergic side effects ( 2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited human data with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. Based on animal reproduction studies, no structural abnormalities were observed when tiotropium was administered by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 790 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in rats and rabbits administered tiotropium at maternally toxic doses 430 times and 40 times the MRHDID, respectively [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In 2 separate embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received tiotropium during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 790 and 8 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 1,471 and 7 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). No evidence of structural abnormalities was observed in rats or rabbits. However, in rats, tiotropium caused fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and the mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation at tiotropium doses of approximately 40 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 78 mcg/kg/day). In rabbits, tiotropium caused an increase in post-implantation loss at a tiotropium dose of approximately 430 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 400 mcg/kg/day). Such effects were not observed at approximately 5 and 95 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 9 and 88 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiotropium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tiotropium is present in milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear [see Data] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tiotropium bromide inhalation powder and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tiotropium bromide inhalation powder or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The distribution of tiotropium bromide into milk was investigated after a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg to lactating rats. Tiotropium and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations above those in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is not indicated for use in children. The safety and effectiveness of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Based on available data, no adjustment of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder dosage in geriatric patients is warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Of the total number of patients who received tiotropium bromide inhalation powder in the 1-year clinical trials, 426 were <65 years, 375 were 65 to 74 years, and 105 were \u226575 years of age. Within each age subgroup, there were no differences between the proportion of patients with adverse events in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder and the comparator groups for most events. Dry mouth increased with age in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group (differences from placebo were 9.0%, 17.1%, and 16.2% in the aforementioned age subgroups). A higher frequency of constipation and urinary tract infections with increasing age was observed in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group in the placebo-controlled studies. The differences from placebo for constipation were 0%, 1.8%, and 7.8% for each of the age groups. The differences from placebo for urinary tract infections were \u20130.6%, 4.6%, and 4.5%. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed among these groups. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE High doses of tiotropium may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms. However, there were no systemic anticholinergic adverse effects following a single inhaled dose of up to 282 mcg tiotropium in 6 healthy volunteers. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, bilateral conjunctivitis and dry mouth were seen following repeated once- daily inhalation of 141 mcg of tiotropium. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. Accidental Ingestion Acute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules is unlikely since it is not well-absorbed systemically. A case of overdose has been reported from postmarketing experience. A female patient was reported to have inhaled 30 capsules over a 2.5 day period, and developed altered mental status, tremors, abdominal pain, and severe constipation. The patient was hospitalized, tiotropium bromide inhalation powder was discontinued, and the constipation was treated with an enema. The patient recovered and was discharged on the same day."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder consists of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules and a LupinHaler device. Each white opaque, hypromellose tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule contains a dry powder consisting of 18 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 22.5 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate USP) blended with lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The contents of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules are intended for oral inhalation only, and are intended for administration only with the LupinHaler device. The active component of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is tiotropium. The drug substance, tiotropium bromide monohydrate, is an anticholinergic with specificity for muscarinic receptors. It is chemically described as (1\u03b1, 2\u03b2, 4\u03b2, 5\u03b1, 7\u03b2)-7-[(Hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo [3.3.1.0 2,4 ] nonane bromide monohydrate. It is a synthetic, non-chiral, quaternary ammonium compound. Tiotropium bromide is a white or yellowish white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in methanol. The structural formula is: Tiotropium bromide (monohydrate) has a molecular mass of 490.4 and a molecular formula of C 19 H 22 NO 4 S 2 Br \u2022 H 2 O. The LupinHaler device is an inhalation device used to inhale the dry powder contained in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. The dry powder is delivered from the LupinHaler device at flow rates as low as 20 L/min. Under standardized in vitro testing, the LupinHaler device delivers a mean of 10.4 mcg tiotropium when tested at a flow rate of 39 L/min for 3.1 seconds (2 L total). In a study of 26 adult patients with COPD and severely compromised lung function [mean FEV 1 1.02 L (range 0.45 to 2.24 L); 37.6% of predicted (range 16% to 65%)], the median peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the LupinHaler device was 30.0 L/min (range 20.4 to 45.6 L/min). The amount of drug delivered to the lungs will vary depending on patient factors such as inspiratory flow and peak inspiratory flow through the LupinHaler device, which may vary from patient to patient, and may vary with the exposure time of the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule outside the blister pack.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30 to 60 msec was higher in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical studies with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tiotropium is administered by dry powder inhalation. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with COPD evaluating once-daily tiotropium delivered from the RESPIMAT inhaler (5 mcg) and as inhalation powder (18 mcg) from the LupinHaler device resulted in a similar systemic exposure between the two products. Absorption Following dry powder inhalation by young healthy volunteers, the absolute bioavailability of 19.5% suggests that the fraction reaching the lung is highly bioavailable. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2-3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 7 minutes after inhalation. Distribution Tiotropium is 72% bound to plasma protein and had a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg after intravenous administration to young healthy volunteers. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after intravenous administration in young healthy volunteers. After chronic once-daily dry powder inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Metabolism The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, neither of which binds to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase II metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations did not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Excretion Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After dry powder inhalation to COPD patients at steady state, urinary excretion was 7% (1.3 mcg) of the unchanged dose over 24 hours. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (365 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 271 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values following administration via LupinHaler device. Renal Impairment Following 4-week tiotropium bromide inhalation powder or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT \u00ae once daily dosing in patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60-<90 mL/min) resulted in 6-23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 6-17% higher C max,ss values; moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-<60 mL/min) resulted in 54-57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 15-31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). There is insufficient data for tiotropium exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) following inhalation of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT \u00ae . However AUC 0-4 and C max were 94% and 52% higher, respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment following intravenous infusion of tiotropium bromide. Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Drug Interactions An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The tiotropium bromide inhalation powder clinical development program consisted of six Phase 3 studies in 2,663 patients with COPD (1,308 receiving tiotropium bromide inhalation powder): two 1-year, placebo-controlled studies, two 6-month, placebo-controlled studies and two 1-year, ipratropium-controlled studies. These studies enrolled patients who had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, were 40 years of age or older, had a history of smoking greater than 10 pack-years, had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) less than or equal to 60% or 65% of predicted, and a ratio of FEV 1 /FVC of less than or equal to 0.7. In these studies, tiotropium bromide inhalation powder, administered once-daily in the morning, provided improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ), with peak effect occurring within 3 hours following the first dose. Two additional trials evaluated exacerbations: a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 1,829 COPD patients in a US Veterans Affairs setting and a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial of 5,992 COPD patients. Long-term effects on lung function and other outcomes, were also evaluated in the 4-year multicenter trial. 6-Month to 1-Year Effects on Lung Function In the 1-year, placebo-controlled trials, the mean improvement in FEV 1 at 30 minutes was 0.13 liters (13%) with a peak improvement of 0.24 liters (24%) relative to baseline after the first dose (Day 1). Further improvements in FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were observed with pharmacodynamic steady state reached by Day 8 with once-daily treatment. The mean peak improvement in FEV 1 , relative to baseline, was 0.28 to 0.31 liters (28% to 31%), after 1 week (Day 8) of once-daily treatment. Improvement of lung function was maintained for 24 hours after a single dose and consistently maintained over the 1-year treatment period with no evidence of tolerance. In the two 6-month, placebo-controlled trials, serial spirometric evaluations were performed throughout daytime hours in Trial A (12 hours) and limited to 3 hours in Trial B. The serial FEV 1 values over 12 hours (Trial A) are displayed in Figure 1. These trials further support the improvement in pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder, which persisted over the spirometric observational period. Effectiveness was maintained for 24 hours after administration over the 6-month treatment period. Figure 1 : Mean FEV 1 Over Time (prior to and after administration of study drug) on Days 1 and 169 for Trial A (a Six-Month Placebo-Controlled Study)* *Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 169, a total of 183 and 149 patients in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder and placebo groups, respectively, completed the trial. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Results of each of the 1-year ipratropium-controlled trials were similar to the results of the 1-year placebo-controlled trials. The results of one of these trials are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 : Mean FEV 1 Over Time (0 to 6 hours post-dose) on Days 1 and 92, Respectively for One of the Two Ipratropium-Controlled Studies* *Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 92 (primary endpoint), a total of 151 and 69 patients in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder and ipratropium groups, respectively, completed through 3 months of observation. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in 105 patients with COPD demonstrated that bronchodilation was maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval in comparison to placebo, regardless of whether tiotropium bromide inhalation powder was administered in the morning or in the evening. Throughout each week of the 1-year treatment period in the two placebo-controlled trials, patients taking tiotropium bromide inhalation powder had a reduced requirement for the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists. Reduction in the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists, as compared to placebo, was demonstrated in one of the two 6 -month studies. 4-Year Effects on Lung Function A 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial involving 5,992 COPD patients was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder on disease progression (rate of decline in FEV 1 ). Patients were permitted to use all respiratory medications (including short-acting and long- acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. The patients were 40 to 88 years of age, 75% male, and 90% Caucasian with a diagnosis of COPD and a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of 39% predicted (range = 9% to 76%) at study entry. There was no difference between the groups in either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, yearly rate of decline in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , as demonstrated by similar slopes of FEV 1 decline over time (Figure 3). Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder maintained improvements in trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 (adjusted means over time: 87 to 103 mL) throughout the 4 years of the study (Figure 3). Figure 3 : Trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 Mean Values at Each Time Point Repeated measure ANOVA was used to estimate means. Means are adjusted for baseline measurements. Baseline trough FEV 1 (observed mean) = 1.12. Patients with \u22653 acceptable pulmonary function tests after Day 30 and non-missing baseline value were included in the analysis. Exacerbations The effect of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in two clinical trials: a 4-year clinical trial described above and a 6-month clinical trial of 1,829 COPD patients in a Veterans Affairs setting. In the 6-month trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as a complex of respiratory symptoms (increase or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at least 3 days requiring treatment with antibiotics, systemic steroids, or hospitalization. The population had an age ranging from 40 to 90 years with 99% males, 91% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre -bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 36% (range = 8% to 93%). Patients were permitted to use respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. In the 6-month trial, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with COPD exacerbation and the proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder significantly reduced the proportion of COPD patients who experienced exacerbations compared to placebo (27.9% vs. 32.3%, respectively; Odds Ratio (OR) (tiotropium/placebo) = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.037). The proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbations in patients who used tiotropium bromide inhalation powder compared to placebo was 7.0% vs. 9.5%, respectively; OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.51, 1.01; p = 0.056. Exacerbations were evaluated as a secondary outcome in the 4-year multicenter trial. In this trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as an increase or new onset of more than one of the following respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, sputum purulence, wheezing, dyspnea) with a duration of three or more days requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) steroids. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder significantly reduced the risk of an exacerbation by 14% (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.81, 0.91; p<0.001) and reduced the risk of exacerbation-related hospitalization by 14% (HR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.95; p<0.002) compared to placebo. The median time to first exacerbation was delayed from 12.5 months (95% CI = 11.5, 13.8) in the placebo group to 16.7 months (95% CI = 14.9, 17.9) in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder group. All-Cause Mortality In the 4-year placebo-controlled lung-function trial described above, all-cause mortality compared to placebo was assessed. There were no significant differences in all- cause mortality rates between tiotropium bromide inhalation powder and placebo. The all-cause mortality of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder was also compared to tiotropium inhalation spray 5 mcg (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT \u00ae 5 mcg) in an additional long-term, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy active-controlled study with an observation period up to 3 years. All-cause mortality was similar between tiotropium bromide inhalation powder and SPIRIVA RESPIMAT \u00ae . Image Image Image"

This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is tiotropium bromide inhalation powder? Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is a prescription medicine used each day (a maintenance medicine) to control symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder helps make your lungs work better for 24 hours. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder relaxes your airways and helps keep them open. You may start to feel like it is easier to breathe on the first day, but it may take longer for you to feel the full effects of the medicine. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder works best and may help make it easier to breathe when you use it every day. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder reduces the likelihood of flare-ups and worsening of COPD symptoms (COPD exacerbations). A COPD exacerbation is defined as an increase or new onset of more than one COPD symptom such as cough, mucus, shortness of breath, and wheezing that requires medicine beyond your rescue medicine. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is not a rescue medicine and should not be used for treating sudden breathing problems. Your doctor may give you other medicine to use for sudden breathing problems. It is not known if tiotropium bromide inhalation powder is safe and effective in children. Who should not take tiotropium bromide inhalation powder? Do not use tiotropium bromide inhalation powder if you: are allergic to tiotropium, ipratropium (Atrovent \u00ae ), or any of the ingredients in tiotropium bromide inhalation powder.

What are the ingredients in tiotropium bromide inhalation powder? Active ingredient: tiotropium Inactive ingredient: lactose monohydrate What is COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)? COPD is a serious lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. Most COPD is caused by smoking. When you have COPD, your airways become narrow. So, air moves out of your lungs more slowly. This makes it hard to breathe. This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Instructions for Use Tiotropium Bromide (tye-oh-TROE-pee-um BROE-mide) Inhalation Powder LupinHaler \u00ae Do NOT swallow Tiotropium Bromide Inhalation Powder Capsules. Important Information about using your tiotropium bromide inhalation powder LupinHaler Do not swallow tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules should only be used with the LupinHaler device and inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Do not use your LupinHaler device to take any other medicine. First read the Patient Information, then read these Instructions for Use before you start to use tiotropium bromide inhalation powder LupinHaler and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. Becoming familiar with your LupinHaler device and tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules: Your tiotropium bromide inhalation powder comes with tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules in blister packaging and a LupinHaler device. Use the new LupinHaler device provided with your medicine. The parts of your LupinHaler device include: (See Figure A) dust cap (lid) mouthpiece mouthpiece ridge base green piercing button center chamber air intake vents Each tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule is packaged in a blister. (See Figure B) Each tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule contains only a small amount of powder. (See Figure C) This is 1 full dose. Do not open the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule or it may not work. Taking your full daily dose of medicine requires 4 main steps. Step 1. Opening your LupinHaler device: After removing your LupinHaler device from the pouch: Open the dust cap (lid) by pressing the green piercing button. (See Figure D) Pull the dust cap (lid) upwards away from the base to expose the mouthpiece. (See Figure E) Open the mouthpiece by pulling the mouthpiece ridge up from the base so the center chamber is showing. (See Figure F) Step 2. Inserting the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule into your LupinHaler device: Each day, separate only 1 of the blisters from the blister card by tearing along the perforated line. (See Figure G) Remove the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule from the blister: Do not cut the foil or use sharp instruments to take out the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule from the blister. Bend 1 of the blister corners with an arrow and separate the aluminum foil layers. Peel back the printed foil until you see the whole tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. (See Figure H) If you have opened more than 1 blister to the air, the extra tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule should not be used and should be thrown away. Place the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule in the center chamber of your LupinHaler device. (See Figure I) Close the mouthpiece firmly against the white base until you hear a click. Leave the dust cap (lid) open. (See Figure J) Step 3. Piercing the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule: Hold your LupinHaler device with the mouthpiece pointed up. (See Figure K) Press the green piercing button once until it is flat (flush) against the base, then release. This is how you make holes in the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule so that you get your medicine when you breathe in. Do not press the green button more than one time. Do not shake your LupinHaler device. The piercing of the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule may produce small pieces of the capsule. Some of these small pieces may pass through the screen of your LupinHaler device into your mouth or throat when you breathe in your medicine. This is normal.The small pieces of the capsule should not harm you. Step 4. Taking your full daily dose (2 inhalations from the same tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule): Breathe out completely in 1 breath , emptying your lungs of any air. (See Figure L) Important: Do not breathe into your LupinHaler device. With your next breath, take your medicine: Hold your head in an upright position while you are looking straight ahead. (See Figure M) Raise your LupinHaler device to your mouth in a horizontal position. Do not block the air intake vents. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Breathe in deeply until your lungs are full. You should hear or feel the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule vibrate (rattle). (See Figure M) Hold your breath for a few seconds and, at the same time, take your LupinHaler device out of your mouth. Breathe normally again. The rattle tells you that you breathed in correctly. If you do not hear or feel a rattle, see the section, \"If you do not hear or feel the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine.\" To get your full daily dose, you must again, breathe out completely (See Figure N) and for a second time, breathe in (See Figure O) from the same tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. Important: Do not press the green piercing button again. Remember: To get your full medicine dose each day, you must breathe in 2 times from the same tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. Make sure you breathe out completely each time before you breathe in from your LupinHaler device. Caring for and storing your tiotropium bromide inhalation powder LupinHaler : After taking your daily dose, open the mouthpiece and tip out the used tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule into your trash can, without touching it. Remove any tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule pieces or tiotropium bromide inhalation powder buildup by turning your LupinHaler device upside down and gently, but firmly, tapping it. (See Figure P) Then, close the mouthpiece and dustcap for storage. Do not store your LupinHaler device and tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules (blisters) in a damp moist place. Always store tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsules in the sealed blisters. If you do not hear or feel the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine: Do not press the green piercing button again. Hold your LupinHaler device with the mouthpiece pointed up and tap your LupinHaler device gently on a table. (See Figure Q) Check to see that the mouthpiece is completely closed. Breathe out completely before deeply breathing in again with the mouthpiece in your mouth. (See Figure O) If you still do not hear or feel the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule rattle after repeating the above steps: Throw away the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button and check the center chamber for pieces of the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. Tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule pieces in the center chamber can cause a tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule not to rattle. Turn your LupinHaler device upside down and gently, but firmly, tap to remove the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule pieces. Call your doctor for instructions. Cleaning your LupinHaler device : Clean your LupinHaler device as needed. (See Figure R) It takes 24 hours to air dry your LupinHaler device after you clean it. Do not use cleaning agents or detergents. Do not place your LupinHaler device in the dishwasher for cleaning. Cleaning Steps: Open the dust cap and mouthpiece Open the base by lifting the green piercing button. Look in the center chamber for tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule pieces or powder buildup. If seen, tap out. Rinse your LupinHaler device with warm water, pressing the green piercing button a few times so that the center chamber and the piercing needle is under the running water. Check that any powder buildup or tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule pieces are removed. Dry your LupinHaler device well by tipping the excess water out on a paper towel. Air-dry afterwards, leaving the dust cap, mouthpiece, and base open by fully spreading it out so that it dries completely. Do not use a hair dryer to dry your LupinHaler device. Do not use your LupinHaler device when it is wet. If needed, you may clean the outside of the mouthpiece with a clean damp cloth. Helpful Hints to help ensure that you are properly taking your full daily dose of tiotropium bromide inhalation powder LupinHaler: Press the green piercing button 1 time; Breathe in 2 times; Breathe out completely before each of the 2 inhalations. Always use the new LupinHaler device provided with your medicine. Keep your LupinHaler device with the mouthpiece pointed up when pressing the green piercing button. Press the green piercing button 1 time to pierce the tiotropium bromide inhalation powder capsule. Do not breathe out into your LupinHaler device. Keep your LupinHaler device in a horizontal position and keep your head upright, looking straight ahead, when breathing in.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Not for acute use: Not a rescue medication ( 5.1 ) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. ( 5.2 ) Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs ( 5.3 ) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Not for Acute Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and should not be used for relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. 5.2 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. In addition, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. 5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled medicines, including SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. Treatment with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be stopped and other treatments considered. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.6 Renal Impairment As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (>5% incidence in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials) were upper respiratory tract infection, dry mouth, sinusitis, pharyngitis, non-specific chest pain, urinary tract infection, dyspepsia, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. 6-Month to 1-Year Trials The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 2,663 patients. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1,308 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran's Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected. The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention. Four multicenter, 1-year, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD.

Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group at a frequency of 1% to 3% in the placebo-controlled trials where the rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, leg pain; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: dysphonia, paresthesia; Gastrointestinal System Disorders: gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), gastroesophageal reflux, stomatitis (including ulcerative stomatitis); Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia; Musculoskeletal System Disorders: skeletal pain; Cardiac Events: angina pectoris (including aggravated angina pectoris); Psychiatric Disorder: depression; Infections: herpes zoster; Respiratory System Disorder (Upper): laryngitis; Vision Disorder: cataract. In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% were atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, angioedema, and urinary retention. In the 1-year trials, the incidence of dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection increased with age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Two multicenter, 6-month, controlled studies evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. The adverse reactions and the incidence rates were similar to those seen in the 1-year controlled trials. 4-Year Trial The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 5,992 COPD patients in a 4-year placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, 2,986 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age range from 40 to 88 years, was 75% male, 90% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 40%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. When the adverse reactions were analyzed with a frequency of \u22653% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by \u22651%, adverse reactions included (SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, placebo): pharyngitis (12.5%, 10.8%), sinusitis (6.5%, 5.3%), headache (5.7%, 4.5%), constipation (5.1%, 3.7%), dry mouth (5.1%, 2.7%), depression (4.4%, 3.3%), insomnia (4.4%, 3.0%), and arthralgia (4.2%, 3.1%). Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed that were reported more frequently in COPD patients treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER than placebo include: dehydration, skin ulcer, stomatitis, gingivitis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dry skin, skin infection, and joint swelling. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

Based on animal reproduction studies, no structural abnormalities were observed when tiotropium was administered by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 790 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in rats and rabbits administered tiotropium at maternally toxic doses 430 times and 40 times the MRHDID, respectively [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In 2 separate embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received tiotropium during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 790 and 8 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 1,471 and 7 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). No evidence of structural abnormalities was observed in rats or rabbits. However, in rats, tiotropium caused fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and the mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation at tiotropium doses of approximately 40 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 78 mcg/kg/day). In rabbits, tiotropium caused an increase in post-implantation loss at a tiotropium dose of approximately 430 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 400 mcg/kg/day). Such effects were not observed at approximately 5 and 95 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 9 and 88 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiotropium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tiotropium is present in milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The distribution of tiotropium bromide into milk was investigated after a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg to lactating rats. Tiotropium and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations above those in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is not indicated for use in children. The safety and effectiveness of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Based on available data, no adjustment of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER dosage in geriatric patients is warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Of the total number of patients who received SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in the 1-year clinical trials, 426 were <65 years, 375 were 65 to 74 years, and 105 were \u226575 years of age. Within each age subgroup, there were no differences between the proportion of patients with adverse events in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and the comparator groups for most events. Dry mouth increased with age in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group (differences from placebo were 9.0%, 17.1%, and 16.2% in the aforementioned age subgroups). A higher frequency of constipation and urinary tract infections with increasing age was observed in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group in the placebo-controlled studies. The differences from placebo for constipation were 0%, 1.8%, and 7.8% for each of the age groups. The differences from placebo for urinary tract infections were \u20130.6%, 4.6%, and 4.5%. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed among these groups. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied."

However, there were no systemic anticholinergic adverse effects following a single inhaled dose of up to 282 mcg tiotropium in 6 healthy volunteers. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, bilateral conjunctivitis and dry mouth were seen following repeated once-daily inhalation of 141 mcg of tiotropium. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. Accidental Ingestion Acute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of SPIRIVA capsules is unlikely since it is not well-absorbed systemically. A case of overdose has been reported from postmarketing experience. A female patient was reported to have inhaled 30 capsules over a 2.5 day period, and developed altered mental status, tremors, abdominal pain, and severe constipation. The patient was hospitalized, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was discontinued, and the constipation was treated with an enema. The patient recovered and was discharged on the same day."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION SPIRIVA HANDIHALER consists of SPIRIVA capsules and a HANDIHALER device. Each light green, hard gelatin SPIRIVA capsule contains a dry powder consisting of 18 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 22.5 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate) blended with lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The contents of SPIRIVA capsules are intended for oral inhalation only, and are intended for administration only with the HANDIHALER device. The active component of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is tiotropium. The drug substance, tiotropium bromide monohydrate, is an anticholinergic with specificity for muscarinic receptors. It is chemically described as (1\u03b1, 2\u03b2, 4\u03b2, 5\u03b1, 7\u03b2)-7-[(Hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonane bromide monohydrate. It is a synthetic, non-chiral, quaternary ammonium compound. Tiotropium bromide is a white or yellowish white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in methanol. The structural formula is: Tiotropium bromide (monohydrate) has a molecular mass of 490.4 and a molecular formula of C 19 H 22 NO 4 S 2 Br \u2219 H 2 O. The HANDIHALER device is an inhalation device used to inhale the dry powder contained in the SPIRIVA capsule. The dry powder is delivered from the HANDIHALER device at flow rates as low as 20 L/min. Under standardized in vitro testing, the HANDIHALER device delivers a mean of 10.4 mcg tiotropium when tested at a flow rate of 39 L/min for 3.1 seconds (2 L total). In a study of 26 adult patients with COPD and severely compromised lung function [mean FEV 1 1.02 L (range 0.45 to 2.24 L); 37.6% of predicted (range 16% to 65%)], the median peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the HANDIHALER device was 30.0 L/min (range 20.4 to 45.6 L/min). The amount of drug delivered to the lungs will vary depending on patient factors such as inspiratory flow and peak inspiratory flow through the HANDIHALER device, which may vary from patient to patient, and may vary with the exposure time of the SPIRIVA capsule outside the blister pack.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30 to 60 msec was higher in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical studies with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tiotropium is administered by dry powder inhalation. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with COPD evaluating once-daily tiotropium delivered from the RESPIMAT inhaler (5 mcg) and as inhalation powder (18 mcg) from the HANDIHALER device resulted in a similar systemic exposure between the two products. Absorption Following dry powder inhalation by young healthy volunteers, the absolute bioavailability of 19.5% suggests that the fraction reaching the lung is highly bioavailable. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2-3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 7 minutes after inhalation. Distribution Tiotropium is 72% bound to plasma protein and had a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg after intravenous administration to young healthy volunteers. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after intravenous administration in young healthy volunteers. After chronic once-daily dry powder inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Metabolism The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, neither of which binds to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase II metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations did not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Excretion Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After dry powder inhalation to COPD patients at steady state, urinary excretion was 7% (1.3 mcg) of the unchanged dose over 24 hours. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (365 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 271 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values following administration via HANDIHALER device. Renal Impairment Following 4-week SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT once daily dosing in patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60-<90 mL/min) resulted in 6-23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 6-17% higher C max,ss values; moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-<60 mL/min) resulted in 54-57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 15-31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). There is insufficient data for tiotropium exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) following inhalation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. However AUC 0-4 and C max were 94% and 52% higher, respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment following intravenous infusion of tiotropium bromide. Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Drug Interactions An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium."

This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, neither of which binds to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase II metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations did not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Excretion Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After dry powder inhalation to COPD patients at steady state, urinary excretion was 7% (1.3 mcg) of the unchanged dose over 24 hours. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (365 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 271 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values following administration via HANDIHALER device. Renal Impairment Following 4-week SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT once daily dosing in patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60-<90 mL/min) resulted in 6-23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 6-17% higher C max,ss values; moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-<60 mL/min) resulted in 54-57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 15-31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). There is insufficient data for tiotropium exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) following inhalation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. However AUC 0-4 and C max were 94% and 52% higher, respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment following intravenous infusion of tiotropium bromide. Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Drug Interactions An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The SPIRIVA HANDIHALER (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) clinical development program consisted of six Phase 3 studies in 2,663 patients with COPD (1,308 receiving SPIRIVA HANDIHALER): two 1-year, placebo-controlled studies, two 6-month, placebo-controlled studies and two 1-year, ipratropium-controlled studies. These studies enrolled patients who had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, were 40 years of age or older, had a history of smoking greater than 10 pack-years, had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) less than or equal to 60% or 65% of predicted, and a ratio of FEV 1 /FVC of less than or equal to 0.7. In these studies, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, administered once-daily in the morning, provided improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ), with peak effect occurring within 3 hours following the first dose. Two additional trials evaluated exacerbations: a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 1,829 COPD patients in a US Veterans Affairs setting and a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial of 5,992 COPD patients. Long-term effects on lung function and other outcomes, were also evaluated in the 4-year multicenter trial. 6-Month to 1-Year Effects on Lung Function In the 1-year, placebo-controlled trials, the mean improvement in FEV 1 at 30 minutes was 0.13 liters (13%) with a peak improvement of 0.24 liters (24%) relative to baseline after the first dose (Day 1). Further improvements in FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were observed with pharmacodynamic steady state reached by Day 8 with once-daily treatment. The mean peak improvement in FEV 1 , relative to baseline, was 0.28 to 0.31 liters (28% to 31%), after 1 week (Day 8) of once-daily treatment. Improvement of lung function was maintained for 24 hours after a single dose and consistently maintained over the 1-year treatment period with no evidence of tolerance. In the two 6-month, placebo-controlled trials, serial spirometric evaluations were performed throughout daytime hours in Trial A (12 hours) and limited to 3 hours in Trial B. The serial FEV 1 values over 12 hours (Trial A) are displayed in Figure 1. These trials further support the improvement in pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, which persisted over the spirometric observational period. Effectiveness was maintained for 24 hours after administration over the 6-month treatment period. Figure 1 Mean FEV 1 Over Time (prior to and after administration of study drug) on Days 1 and 169 for Trial A (a Six-Month Placebo-Controlled Study) Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 169, a total of 183 and 149 patients in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and placebo groups, respectively, completed the trial. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Day 1 Day 169 Results of each of the 1-year ipratropium-controlled trials were similar to the results of the 1-year placebo-controlled trials. The results of one of these trials are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Mean FEV 1 Over Time (0 to 6 hours post-dose) on Days 1 and 92, Respectively for One of the Two Ipratropium-Controlled Studies Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 92 (primary endpoint), a total of 151 and 69 patients in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and ipratropium groups, respectively, completed through 3 months of observation. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Day 1 Day 92 A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in 105 patients with COPD demonstrated that bronchodilation was maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval in comparison to placebo, regardless of whether SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was administered in the morning or in the evening. Throughout each week of the 1-year treatment period in the two placebo-controlled trials, patients taking SPIRIVA HANDIHALER had a reduced requirement for the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists. Reduction in the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists, as compared to placebo, was demonstrated in one of the two 6-month studies. Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 2 4-Year Effects on Lung Function A 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial involving 5,992 COPD patients was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER on disease progression (rate of decline in FEV 1 ). Patients were permitted to use all respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. The patients were 40 to 88 years of age, 75% male, and 90% Caucasian with a diagnosis of COPD and a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of 39% predicted (range = 9% to 76%) at study entry. There was no difference between the groups in either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, yearly rate of decline in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , as demonstrated by similar slopes of FEV 1 decline over time (Figure 3). SPIRIVA HANDIHALER maintained improvements in trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 (adjusted means over time: 87 to 103 mL) throughout the 4 years of the study (Figure 3). Figure 3 Trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 Mean Values at Each Time Point Repeated measure ANOVA was used to estimate means. Means are adjusted for baseline measurements. Baseline trough FEV 1 (observed mean) = 1.12. Patients with \u22653 acceptable pulmonary function tests after Day 30 and non-missing baseline value were included in the analysis. Figure 3 Exacerbations The effect of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in two clinical trials: a 4-year clinical trial described above and a 6-month clinical trial of 1,829 COPD patients in a Veterans Affairs setting. In the 6-month trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as a complex of respiratory symptoms (increase or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at least 3 days requiring treatment with antibiotics, systemic steroids, or hospitalization. The population had an age ranging from 40 to 90 years with 99% males, 91% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 36% (range = 8% to 93%). Patients were permitted to use respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. In the 6-month trial, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with COPD exacerbation and the proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER significantly reduced the proportion of COPD patients who experienced exacerbations compared to placebo (27.9% vs. 32.3%, respectively; Odds Ratio (OR) (tiotropium/placebo) = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.037). The proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbations in patients who used SPIRIVA HANDIHALER compared to placebo was 7.0% vs. 9.5%, respectively; OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.51, 1.01; p = 0.056. Exacerbations were evaluated as a secondary outcome in the 4-year multicenter trial. In this trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as an increase or new onset of more than one of the following respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, sputum purulence, wheezing, dyspnea) with a duration of three or more days requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) steroids. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER significantly reduced the risk of an exacerbation by 14% (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.81, 0.91; p<0.001) and reduced the risk of exacerbation-related hospitalization by 14% (HR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.95; p<0.002) compared to placebo. The median time to first exacerbation was delayed from 12.5 months (95% CI = 11.5, 13.8) in the placebo group to 16.7 months (95% CI = 14.9, 17.9) in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group. All-Cause Mortality In the 4-year placebo-controlled lung-function trial described above, all-cause mortality compared to placebo was assessed. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality rates between SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and placebo. The all-cause mortality of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was also compared to tiotropium inhalation spray 5 mcg (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg) in an additional long-term, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy active-controlled study with an observation period up to 3 years. All-cause mortality was similar between SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and SPIRIVA RESPIMAT."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Not for Acute Use: Instruct patients that SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator and should not be used for immediate relief of breathing problems (i.e., as a rescue medication). Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Advise patient to immediately discontinue treatment and consult a physician should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Paradoxical Bronchospasm: Inform patients that SPIRIVA HANDIHALER can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Advise patients that if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, patients should discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Instruct patients to be alert for signs and symptoms of narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs and symptoms develop. Inform patients that care must be taken not to allow the powder to enter into the eyes as this may cause blurring of vision and pupil dilation. Since dizziness and blurred vision may occur with the use of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, caution patients about engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Worsening of Urinary Retention: Instruct patients to be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Instructions for Administering SPIRIVA HANDIHALER: Instruct patients on how to correctly administer SPIRIVA capsules using the HANDIHALER device [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] .

      "Patient Information SPIRIVA \u00ae (speh REE vah) HANDIHALER \u00ae (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) Do NOT swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Important Information: Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the HANDIHALER device and inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Read the information that comes with your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER before you start using it and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is a prescription medicine used each day (a maintenance medicine) to control symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER helps make your lungs work better for 24 hours. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER relaxes your airways and helps keep them open. You may start to feel like it is easier to breathe on the first day, but it may take longer for you to feel the full effects of the medicine. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER works best and may help make it easier to breathe when you use it every day. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER reduces the likelihood of flare-ups and worsening of COPD symptoms (COPD exacerbations). A COPD exacerbation is defined as an increase or new onset of more than one COPD symptom such as cough, mucus, shortness of breath, and wheezing that requires medicine beyond your rescue medicine. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is not a rescue medicine and should not be used for treating sudden breathing problems. Your doctor may give you other medicine to use for sudden breathing problems. It is not known if SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is safe and effective in children. Who should not take SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? Do not use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER if you: are allergic to tiotropium, ipratropium (Atrovent \u00ae ), or any of the ingredients in SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER may include: raised red patches on your skin (hives) itching rash swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing If you have these symptoms of an allergic reaction, stop taking SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and call your doctor right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. What should I tell my doctor before using SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? Before taking SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have kidney problems. have glaucoma. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER may make your glaucoma worse. have an enlarged prostate, problems passing urine, or a blockage in your bladder. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER may make these problems worse. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if SPIRIVA HANDIHALER could harm your unborn baby. are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. It is not known if SPIRIVA HANDIHALER passes into breast milk. You and your doctor will decide if SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is right for you while you breast-feed. have a severe allergy to milk proteins. Ask your doctor if you are not sure. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines and eye drops, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some of your other medicines or supplements may affect the way SPIRIVA HANDIHALER works. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is an anticholinergic medicine. You should not take other anticholinergic medicines while using SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, including ipratropium. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if one of your medicines is an anticholinergic. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER exactly as prescribed. Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER one time every day. Read the \"Instructions for Use\" at the end of this leaflet before you use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Talk with your doctor if you do not understand the instructions. Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Only use SPIRIVA capsules with the HANDIHALER device. Do not use the HANDIHALER device to take any other medicine . SPIRIVA HANDIHALER comes as a powder in a SPIRIVA capsule that fits the HANDIHALER device. Each SPIRIVA capsule, containing only a small amount of SPIRIVA powder, is one full dose of medicine. Separate one blister from the blister card. Then take out one of the SPIRIVA capsules from the blister package right before you use it. After the capsule is pierced, take a complete dose of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER by breathing in the powder by mouth two times, using the HANDIHALER device (take 2 inhalations from one SPIRIVA capsule). See the \" Instructions for Use \" at the end of this leaflet. Throw away any SPIRIVA capsule that is not used right away after it is taken out of the blister package. Do not leave the SPIRIVA capsules open to air; they may not work as well. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Do not use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER more than one time every 24 hours. If you use more than your prescribed dose of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, call your doctor or a poison control center. What should I avoid while using SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? Do not let the powder from the SPIRIVA capsule get into your eyes. Your vision may get blurry and the pupil in your eye may get larger (dilate). If this happens, call your doctor. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER can cause dizziness and blurred vision. Should you experience these symptoms you should use caution when engaging in activities such as driving a car or operating appliances or other machines. What are the possible side effects of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? SPIRIVA HANDIHALER can cause serious side effects, including: Allergic reaction.

What are the ingredients in SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? Active ingredient: tiotropium Inactive ingredient: lactose monohydrate What is COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)? COPD is a serious lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. Most COPD is caused by smoking. When you have COPD, your airways become narrow. So, air moves out of your lungs more slowly. This makes it hard to breathe. This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "Instructions for Use SPIRIVA\u00ae (speh REE vah) HANDIHALER\u00ae (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Important Information about using your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the HANDIHALER device and inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Do not use your HANDIHALER device to take any other medicine. First read the Patient Information, then read these Instructions for Use before you start to use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. Becoming familiar with your HANDIHALER device and SPIRIVA capsules: Your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER comes with SPIRIVA capsules in blister packaging and a HANDIHALER device. Use the new HANDIHALER device provided with your medicine. Figure A The parts of your HANDIHALER device include: (See Figure A ) dust cap (lid) mouthpiece mouthpiece ridge base green piercing button center chamber air intake vents Figure B Each SPIRIVA capsule is packaged in a blister. (See Figure B ) Figure C Each SPIRIVA capsule contains only a small amount of powder. (See Figure C ) This is 1 full dose. Do not open the SPIRIVA capsule or it may not work. Taking your full daily dose of medicine requires 4 main steps. Step 1. Opening your HANDIHALER device: Figure D After removing your HANDIHALER device from the pouch: Open the dust cap (lid) by pressing the green piercing button. (See Figure D ) Figure E Pull the dust cap (lid) upwards away from the base to expose the mouthpiece. (See Figure E ) Figure F Open the mouthpiece by pulling the mouthpiece ridge up and away from the base so the center chamber is showing. (See Figure F ) Step 2. Inserting the SPIRIVA capsule into your HANDIHALER device: Figure G Each day, separate only 1 of the blisters from the blister card by tearing along the perforated line. (See Figure G ) Figure H Remove the SPIRIVA capsule from the blister: Do not cut the foil or use sharp instruments to take out the SPIRIVA capsule from the blister. Bend 1 of the blister corners with an arrow and separate the aluminum foil layers. Peel back the printed foil until you see the whole SPIRIVA capsule. (See Figure H ) If you have opened more than 1 blister to the air, the extra SPIRIVA capsule should not be used and should be thrown away. Figure I Place the SPIRIVA capsule in the center chamber of your HANDIHALER device. (See Figure I ) Figure J Close the mouthpiece firmly against the gray base until you hear a click. Leave the dust cap (lid) open. (See Figure J ) Step 3. Piercing the SPIRIVA capsule: Figure K Hold your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up. (See Figure K ) Press the green piercing button once until it is flat (flush) against the base, then release. This is how you make holes in the SPIRIVA capsule so that you get your medicine when you breathe in. Do not press the green button more than one time. Do not shake your HANDIHALER device. The piercing of the SPIRIVA capsule may produce small gelatin pieces. Some of these small pieces may pass through the screen of your HANDIHALER device into your mouth or throat when you breathe in your medicine. This is normal. The small pieces of gelatin should not harm you. Step 4. Taking your full daily dose (2 inhalations from the same SPIRIVA capsule): Figure L Breathe out completely in 1 breath , emptying your lungs of any air. (See Figure L ) Important: Do not breathe into your HANDIHALER device. Figure M With your next breath, take your medicine: Hold your head in an upright position while you are looking straight ahead. (See Figure M ) Raise your HANDIHALER device to your mouth in a horizontal position. Do not block the air intake vents. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Breathe in deeply until your lungs are full. You should hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule vibrate (rattle). (See Figure M ) Hold your breath for a few seconds and, at the same time, take your HANDIHALER device out of your mouth. Breathe normally again. The rattle tells you that you breathed in correctly. If you do not hear or feel a rattle, see the section, \" If you do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine .\" Figure N To get your full daily dose, you must again, breathe out completely (See Figure N ) and for a second time, breathe in (See Figure O ) from the same SPIRIVA capsule. Important: Do not press the green piercing button again. Figure O Remember: To get your full medicine dose each day, you must breathe in 2 times from the same SPIRIVA capsule. Make sure you breathe out completely each time before you breathe in from your HANDIHALER device. Caring for and storing your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER : Figure P After taking your daily dose, open the mouthpiece and tip out the used SPIRIVA capsule into your trash can, without touching it. Remove any SPIRIVA capsule pieces or SPIRIVA powder buildup by turning your HANDIHALER device upside down and gently, but firmly, tapping it. (See Figure P ) Then, close the mouthpiece and dustcap for storage. Do not store your HANDIHALER device and SPIRIVA capsules (blisters) in a damp moist place. Always store SPIRIVA capsules in the sealed blisters. If you do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine: Figure Q Do not press the green piercing button again. Hold your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up and tap your HANDIHALER device gently on a table. (See Figure Q ) Check to see that the mouthpiece is completely closed. Breathe out completely before deeply breathing in again with the mouthpiece in your mouth. (See Figure O ) If you still do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle after repeating the above steps: Throw away the SPIRIVA capsule. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button and check the center chamber for pieces of the SPIRIVA capsule. SPIRIVA capsule pieces in the center chamber can cause a SPIRIVA capsule not to rattle. Turn your HANDIHALER device upside down and gently, but firmly, tap to remove the SPIRIVA capsule pieces. Call your doctor for instructions. Cleaning your HANDIHALER device : Figure R Clean your HANDIHALER device as needed. (See Figure R ) It takes 24 hours to air dry your HANDIHALER device after you clean it. Do not use cleaning agents or detergents. Do not place your HANDIHALER device in the dishwasher for cleaning. Cleaning Steps: Open the dust cap and mouthpiece. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button. Look in the center chamber for SPIRIVA capsule pieces or powder buildup. If seen, tap out. Rinse your HANDIHALER device with warm water, pressing the green piercing button a few times so that the center chamber and the piercing needle is under the running water. Check that any powder buildup or SPIRIVA capsule pieces are removed. Dry your HANDIHALER device well by tipping the excess water out on a paper towel. Air-dry afterwards, leaving the dust cap, mouthpiece, and base open by fully spreading it out so that it dries completely. Do not use a hair dryer to dry your HANDIHALER device. Do not use your HANDIHALER device when it is wet. If needed, you may clean the outside of the mouthpiece with a clean damp cloth. Helpful Hints to help ensure that you are properly taking your full daily dose of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER: Press the green piercing button 1 time; Breathe in 2 times; Breathe out completely before each of the 2 inhalations. Always use the new HANDIHALER device provided with your medicine. Keep your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up when pressing the green piercing button. Press the green piercing button 1 time to pierce the SPIRIVA capsule. Do not breathe out into your HANDIHALER device. Keep your HANDIHALER device in a horizontal position and keep your head upright, looking straight ahead, when breathing in. Check the center chamber of your HANDIHALER device for SPIRIVA capsule pieces or powder build-up. If pieces or powder are seen, tap out before use. Clean your HANDIHALER as needed and dry thoroughly.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Not for acute use: Not a rescue medication ( 5.1 ) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. ( 5.2 ) Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs ( 5.3 ) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Not for Acute Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and should not be used for relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. 5.2 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. In addition, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. 5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled medicines, including SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. Treatment with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be stopped and other treatments considered. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.6 Renal Impairment As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (>5% incidence in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials) were upper respiratory tract infection, dry mouth, sinusitis, pharyngitis, non-specific chest pain, urinary tract infection, dyspepsia, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. 6-Month to 1-Year Trials The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 2663 patients. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1308 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dose of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran's Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected. The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention. Four multicenter, 1-year, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of \u22653% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by \u22651%. The frequency of corresponding reactions in the ipratropium-controlled trials is included for comparison.

Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group at a frequency of 1% to 3% in the placebo-controlled trials where the rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, leg pain; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: dysphonia, paresthesia; Gastrointestinal System Disorders: gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), gastroesophageal reflux, stomatitis (including ulcerative stomatitis); Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia; Musculoskeletal System Disorders: skeletal pain; Cardiac Events: angina pectoris (including aggravated angina pectoris); Psychiatric Disorder: depression; Infections: herpes zoster; Respiratory System Disorder (Upper): laryngitis; Vision Disorder: cataract. In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% were atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, angioedema, and urinary retention. In the 1-year trials, the incidence of dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection increased with age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Two multicenter, 6-month, controlled studies evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. The adverse reactions and the incidence rates were similar to those seen in the 1-year controlled trials. 4-Year Trial The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 5992 COPD patients in a 4-year placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, 2986 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dose of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age range from 40 to 88 years, was 75% male, 90% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 40%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. When the adverse reactions were analyzed with a frequency of \u22653% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by \u22651%, adverse reactions included (SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, placebo): pharyngitis (12.5%, 10.8%), sinusitis (6.5%, 5.3%), headache (5.7%, 4.5%), constipation (5.1%, 3.7%), dry mouth (5.1%, 2.7%), depression (4.4%, 3.3%), insomnia (4.4%, 3.0%), and arthralgia (4.2%, 3.1%). Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed that were reported more frequently in COPD patients treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER than placebo include: dehydration, skin ulcer, stomatitis, gingivitis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dry skin, skin infection, and joint swelling. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for potential anticholinergic side effects ( 2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited human data with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. Based on animal reproduction studies, no structural abnormalities were observed when tiotropium was administered by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 790 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in rats and rabbits administered tiotropium at maternally toxic doses 430 times and 40 times the MRHDID, respectively [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In 2 separate embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received tiotropium during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 790 and 8 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 1471 and 7 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). No evidence of structural abnormalities was observed in rats or rabbits. However, in rats, tiotropium caused fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and the mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation at tiotropium doses of approximately 40 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 78 mcg/kg/day). In rabbits, tiotropium caused an increase in post-implantation loss at a tiotropium dose of approximately 430 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 400 mcg/kg/day). Such effects were not observed at approximately 5 and 95 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 9 and 88 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiotropium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tiotropium is present in milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The distribution of tiotropium bromide into milk was investigated after a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg to lactating rats. Tiotropium and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations above those in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is not indicated for use in children. The safety and effectiveness of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Based on available data, no adjustment of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER dosage in geriatric patients is warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Of the total number of patients who received SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in the 1-year clinical trials, 426 were <65 years, 375 were 65 to 74 years, and 105 were \u226575 years of age. Within each age subgroup, there were no differences between the proportion of patients with adverse events in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and the comparator groups for most events. Dry mouth increased with age in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group (differences from placebo were 9.0%, 17.1%, and 16.2% in the aforementioned age subgroups). A higher frequency of constipation and urinary tract infections with increasing age was observed in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group in the placebo-controlled studies. The differences from placebo for constipation were 0%, 1.8%, and 7.8% for each of the age groups. The differences from placebo for urinary tract infections were \u20130.6%, 4.6%, and 4.5%. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed among these groups. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied."

In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, bilateral conjunctivitis and dry mouth were seen following repeated once-daily inhalation of 141 mcg of tiotropium. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. Accidental Ingestion Acute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of SPIRIVA capsules is unlikely since it is not well-absorbed systemically. A case of overdose has been reported from postmarketing experience. A female patient was reported to have inhaled 30 capsules over a 2.5 day period, and developed altered mental status, tremors, abdominal pain, and severe constipation. The patient was hospitalized, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was discontinued, and the constipation was treated with an enema. The patient recovered and was discharged on the same day."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION SPIRIVA HANDIHALER consists of SPIRIVA capsules and a HANDIHALER device. Each light green, hard gelatin SPIRIVA capsule contains a dry powder consisting of 18 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 22.5 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate) blended with lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The contents of SPIRIVA capsules are intended for oral inhalation only, and are intended for administration only with the HANDIHALER device. The active component of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is tiotropium. The drug substance, tiotropium bromide monohydrate, is an anticholinergic with specificity for muscarinic receptors. It is chemically described as (1\u03b1, 2\u03b2, 4\u03b2, 5\u03b1, 7\u03b2)-7-[(Hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonane bromide monohydrate. It is a synthetic, non-chiral, quaternary ammonium compound. Tiotropium bromide is a white or yellowish white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in methanol. The structural formula is: Tiotropium bromide (monohydrate) has a molecular mass of 490.4 and a molecular formula of C 19 H 22 NO 4 S 2 Br \u2219 H 2 O. The HANDIHALER device is an inhalation device used to inhale the dry powder contained in the SPIRIVA capsule. The dry powder is delivered from the HANDIHALER device at flow rates as low as 20 L/min. Under standardized in vitro testing, the HANDIHALER device delivers a mean of 10.4 mcg tiotropium when tested at a flow rate of 39 L/min for 3.1 seconds (2 L total). In a study of 26 adult patients with COPD and severely compromised lung function [mean FEV 1 1.02 L (range 0.45 to 2.24 L); 37.6% of predicted (range 16% to 65%)], the median peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the HANDIHALER device was 30.0 L/min (range 20.4 to 45.6 L/min). The amount of drug delivered to the lungs will vary depending on patient factors such as inspiratory flow and peak inspiratory flow through the HANDIHALER device, which may vary from patient to patient, and may vary with the exposure time of the SPIRIVA capsule outside the blister pack.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30 to 60 msec was higher in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical studies with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tiotropium is administered by dry powder inhalation. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with COPD evaluating once-daily tiotropium delivered from the RESPIMAT inhaler (5 mcg) and as inhalation powder (18 mcg) from the HANDIHALER device resulted in a similar systemic exposure between the two products. Absorption Following dry powder inhalation by young healthy volunteers, the absolute bioavailability of 19.5% suggests that the fraction reaching the lung is highly bioavailable. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2-3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 7 minutes after inhalation. Distribution Tiotropium is 72% bound to plasma protein and had a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg after intravenous administration to young healthy volunteers. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after intravenous administration in young healthy volunteers. After chronic once-daily dry powder inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Metabolism The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, neither of which binds to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase II metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations did not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Excretion Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After dry powder inhalation to COPD patients at steady state, urinary excretion was 7% (1.3mcg) of the unchanged dose over 24 hours. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (365 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 271 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values following administration via HANDIHALER device. Renal Impairment Following 4-week SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT once daily dosing in patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60-<90 mL/min) resulted in 6-23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 6-17% higher C max,ss values; moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-<60 mL/min) resulted in 54-57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 15-31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). There is insufficient data for tiotropium exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) following inhalation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. However AUC 0-4 and C max were 94% and 52% higher, respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment following intravenous infusion of tiotropium bromide. Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Drug Interactions An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30 to 60 msec was higher in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical studies with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tiotropium is administered by dry powder inhalation. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with COPD evaluating once-daily tiotropium delivered from the RESPIMAT inhaler (5 mcg) and as inhalation powder (18 mcg) from the HANDIHALER device resulted in a similar systemic exposure between the two products.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The SPIRIVA HANDIHALER (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) clinical development program consisted of six Phase 3 studies in 2663 patients with COPD (1308 receiving SPIRIVA HANDIHALER): two 1-year, placebo-controlled studies, two 6-month, placebo-controlled studies and two 1-year, ipratropium-controlled studies. These studies enrolled patients who had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, were 40 years of age or older, had a history of smoking greater than 10 pack-years, had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) less than or equal to 60% or 65% of predicted, and a ratio of FEV 1 /FVC of less than or equal to 0.7. In these studies, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, administered once-daily in the morning, provided improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ), with peak effect occurring within 3 hours following the first dose. Two additional trials evaluated exacerbations: a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 1829 COPD patients in a US Veterans Affairs setting and a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial of 5992 COPD patients. Long-term effects on lung function and other outcomes, were also evaluated in the 4-year multicenter trial. 6-Month to 1-Year Effects on Lung Function In the 1-year, placebo-controlled trials, the mean improvement in FEV 1 at 30 minutes was 0.13 liters (13%) with a peak improvement of 0.24 liters (24%) relative to baseline after the first dose (Day 1). Further improvements in FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were observed with pharmacodynamic steady state reached by Day 8 with once-daily treatment. The mean peak improvement in FEV 1 , relative to baseline, was 0.28 to 0.31 liters (28% to 31%), after 1 week (Day 8) of once-daily treatment. Improvement of lung function was maintained for 24 hours after a single dose and consistently maintained over the 1-year treatment period with no evidence of tolerance. In the two 6-month, placebo-controlled trials, serial spirometric evaluations were performed throughout daytime hours in Trial A (12 hours) and limited to 3 hours in Trial B. The serial FEV 1 values over 12 hours (Trial A) are displayed in Figure 1. These trials further support the improvement in pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, which persisted over the spirometric observational period. Effectiveness was maintained for 24 hours after administration over the 6-month treatment period. Figure 1 Mean FEV 1 Over Time (prior to and after administration of study drug) on Days 1 and 169 for Trial A (a Six-Month Placebo-Controlled Study) Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 169, a total of 183 and 149 patients in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and placebo groups, respectively, completed the trial. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Day 1 Day 169 Results of each of the 1-year ipratropium-controlled trials were similar to the results of the 1-year placebo-controlled trials. The results of one of these trials are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Mean FEV 1 Over Time (0 to 6 hours post-dose) on Days 1 and 92, Respectively for One of the Two Ipratropium-Controlled Studies Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 92 (primary endpoint), a total of 151 and 69 patients in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and ipratropium groups, respectively, completed through 3 months of observation. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Day 1 Day 92 A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in 105 patients with COPD demonstrated that bronchodilation was maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval in comparison to placebo, regardless of whether SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was administered in the morning or in the evening. Throughout each week of the 1-year treatment period in the two placebo-controlled trials, patients taking SPIRIVA HANDIHALER had a reduced requirement for the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists. Reduction in the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists, as compared to placebo, was demonstrated in one of the two 6-month studies. Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 2 4-Year Effects on Lung Function A 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial involving 5992 COPD patients was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER on disease progression (rate of decline in FEV 1 ). Patients were permitted to use all respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. The patients were 40 to 88 years of age, 75% male, and 90% Caucasian with a diagnosis of COPD and a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of 39% predicted (range = 9% to 76%) at study entry. There was no difference between the groups in either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, yearly rate of decline in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , as demonstrated by similar slopes of FEV 1 decline over time (Figure 3). SPIRIVA HANDIHALER maintained improvements in trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 (adjusted means over time: 87 to 103 mL) throughout the 4 years of the study (Figure 3). Figure 3 Trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 Mean Values at Each Time Point Repeated measure ANOVA was used to estimate means. Means are adjusted for baseline measurements. Baseline trough FEV 1 (observed mean) = 1.12. Patients with \u22653 acceptable pulmonary function tests after Day 30 and non-missing baseline value were included in the analysis. Figure 3 Exacerbations The effect of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in two clinical trials: a 4-year clinical trial described above and a 6-month clinical trial of 1829 COPD patients in a Veterans Affairs setting. In the 6-month trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as a complex of respiratory symptoms (increase or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at least 3 days requiring treatment with antibiotics, systemic steroids, or hospitalization. The population had an age ranging from 40 to 90 years with 99% males, 91% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 36% (range = 8% to 93%). Patients were permitted to use respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. In the 6-month trial, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with COPD exacerbation and the proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER significantly reduced the proportion of COPD patients who experienced exacerbations compared to placebo (27.9% vs. 32.3%, respectively; Odds Ratio (OR) (tiotropium/placebo) = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.037). The proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbations in patients who used SPIRIVA HANDIHALER compared to placebo was 7.0% vs. 9.5%, respectively; OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.51, 1.01; p = 0.056. Exacerbations were evaluated as a secondary outcome in the 4-year multicenter trial. In this trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as an increase or new onset of more than one of the following respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, sputum purulence, wheezing, dyspnea) with a duration of three or more days requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) steroids. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER significantly reduced the risk of an exacerbation by 14% (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.81, 0.91; p<0.001) and reduced the risk of exacerbation-related hospitalization by 14% (HR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.95; p<0.002) compared to placebo. The median time to first exacerbation was delayed from 12.5 months (95% CI = 11.5, 13.8) in the placebo group to 16.7 months (95% CI = 14.9, 17.9) in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group. All-Cause Mortality In the 4-year placebo-controlled lung-function trial described above, all-cause mortality compared to placebo was assessed. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality rates between SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and placebo. The all-cause mortality of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was also compared to tiotropium inhalation spray 5 mcg (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg) in an additional long-term, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy active-controlled study with an observation period up to 3 years. All-cause mortality was similar between SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and SPIRIVA RESPIMAT."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Not for Acute Use: Instruct patients that SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator and should not be used for immediate relief of breathing problems (i.e., as a rescue medication). Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Advise patient to immediately discontinue treatment and consult a physician should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Paradoxical Bronchospasm: Inform patients that SPIRIVA HANDIHALER can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Advise patients that if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, patients should discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Instruct patients to be alert for signs and symptoms of narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs and symptoms develop. Inform patients that care must be taken not to allow the powder to enter into the eyes as this may cause blurring of vision and pupil dilation. Since dizziness and blurred vision may occur with the use of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, caution patients about engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Worsening of Urinary Retention: Instruct patients to be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Instructions for Administering SPIRIVA HANDIHALER: Instruct patients on how to correctly administer SPIRIVA capsules using the HANDIHALER device [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Instruct patients that SPIRIVA capsules should only be administered via the HANDIHALER device and the HANDIHALER device should not be used for administering other medications. Remind patients that the contents of SPIRIVA capsules are for oral inhalation only and must not be swallowed . Instruct patients always to store SPIRIVA capsules in sealed blisters and to remove only one SPIRIVA capsule immediately before use or its effectiveness may be reduced. Instruct patients to discard unused additional SPIRIVA capsules that are exposed to air (i.e., not intended for immediate use)."

      "Patient Information SPIRIVA \u00ae (speh REE vah) HANDIHALER \u00ae (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) Do NOT swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Important Information: Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the HANDIHALER device and inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Read the information that comes with your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER before you start using it and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is a prescription medicine used each day (a maintenance medicine) to control symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER helps make your lungs work better for 24 hours. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER relaxes your airways and helps keep them open. You may start to feel like it is easier to breathe on the first day, but it may take longer for you to feel the full effects of the medicine. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER works best and may help make it easier to breathe when you use it every day. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER reduces the likelihood of flare-ups and worsening of COPD symptoms (COPD exacerbations). A COPD exacerbation is defined as an increase or new onset of more than one COPD symptom such as cough, mucus, shortness of breath, and wheezing that requires medicine beyond your rescue medicine. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is not a rescue medicine and should not be used for treating sudden breathing problems. Your doctor may give you other medicine to use for sudden breathing problems. It is not known if SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is safe and effective in children. Who should not take SPIRIVA HANDIHALER? Do not use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER if you: are allergic to tiotropium, ipratropium (Atrovent \u00ae ), or any of the ingredients in SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER may include: raised red patches on your skin (hives) itching rash swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing If you have these symptoms of an allergic reaction, stop taking SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and call your doctor right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. What should I tell my doctor before using SPIRIVA HANDIHALER?

      "Instructions for Use SPIRIVA\u00ae (speh REE vah) HANDIHALER\u00ae (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Important Information about using your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the HANDIHALER device and inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Do not use your HANDIHALER device to take any other medicine. First read the Patient Information, then read these Instructions for Use before you start to use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. Becoming familiar with your HANDIHALER device and SPIRIVA capsules: Your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER comes with SPIRIVA capsules in blister packaging and a HANDIHALER device. Use the new HANDIHALER device provided with your medicine. Figure A The parts of your HANDIHALER device include: (See Figure A ) dust cap (lid) mouthpiece mouthpiece ridge base green piercing button center chamber air intake vents Figure B Each SPIRIVA capsule is packaged in a blister. (See Figure B ) Figure C Each SPIRIVA capsule contains only a small amount of powder. (See Figure C ) This is 1 full dose. Do not open the SPIRIVA capsule or it may not work. Taking your full daily dose of medicine requires 4 main steps. Step 1. Opening your HANDIHALER device: Figure D After removing your HANDIHALER device from the pouch: Open the dust cap (lid) by pressing the green piercing button. (See Figure D ) Figure E Pull the dust cap (lid) upwards away from the base to expose the mouthpiece. (See Figure E ) Figure F Open the mouthpiece by pulling the mouthpiece ridge up and away from the base so the center chamber is showing. (See Figure F ) Step 2. Inserting the SPIRIVA capsule into your HANDIHALER device: Figure G Each day, separate only 1 of the blisters from the blister card by tearing along the perforated line. (See Figure G ) Figure H Remove the SPIRIVA capsule from the blister: Do not cut the foil or use sharp instruments to take out the SPIRIVA capsule from the blister. Bend 1 of the blister corners with an arrow and separate the aluminum foil layers. Peel back the printed foil until you see the whole SPIRIVA capsule. (See Figure H ) If you have opened more than 1 blister to the air, the extra SPIRIVA capsule should not be used and should be thrown away. Figure I Place the SPIRIVA capsule in the center chamber of your HANDIHALER device. (See Figure I ) Figure J Close the mouthpiece firmly against the gray base until you hear a click. Leave the dust cap (lid) open. (See Figure J ) Step 3. Piercing the SPIRIVA capsule: Figure K Hold your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up. (See Figure K ) Press the green piercing button once until it is flat (flush) against the base, then release. This is how you make holes in the SPIRIVA capsule so that you get your medicine when you breathe in. Do not press the green button more than one time. Do not shake your HANDIHALER device. The piercing of the SPIRIVA capsule may produce small gelatin pieces. Some of these small pieces may pass through the screen of your HANDIHALER device into your mouth or throat when you breathe in your medicine. This is normal. The small pieces of gelatin should not harm you. Step 4. Taking your full daily dose (2 inhalations from the same SPIRIVA capsule): Figure L Breathe out completely in 1 breath , emptying your lungs of any air. (See Figure L ) Important: Do not breathe into your HANDIHALER device. Figure M With your next breath, take your medicine: Hold your head in an upright position while you are looking straight ahead. (See Figure M ) Raise your HANDIHALER device to your mouth in a horizontal position. Do not block the air intake vents. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Breathe in deeply until your lungs are full. You should hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule vibrate (rattle). (See Figure M ) Hold your breath for a few seconds and, at the same time, take your HANDIHALER device out of your mouth. Breathe normally again. The rattle tells you that you breathed in correctly. If you do not hear or feel a rattle, see the section, \" If you do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine .\" Figure N To get your full daily dose, you must again, breathe out completely (See Figure N ) and for a second time, breathe in (See Figure O ) from the same SPIRIVA capsule. Important: Do not press the green piercing button again. Figure O Remember: To get your full medicine dose each day, you must breathe in 2 times from the same SPIRIVA capsule. Make sure you breathe out completely each time before you breathe in from your HANDIHALER device. Caring for and storing your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER : Figure P After taking your daily dose, open the mouthpiece and tip out the used SPIRIVA capsule into your trash can, without touching it. Remove any SPIRIVA capsule pieces or SPIRIVA powder buildup by turning your HANDIHALER device upside down and gently, but firmly, tapping it. (See Figure P ) Then, close the mouthpiece and dustcap for storage. Do not store your HANDIHALER device and SPIRIVA capsules (blisters) in a damp moist place. Always store SPIRIVA capsules in the sealed blisters. If you do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine: Figure Q Do not press the green piercing button again. Hold your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up and tap your HANDIHALER device gently on a table. (See Figure Q ) Check to see that the mouthpiece is completely closed. Breathe out completely before deeply breathing in again with the mouthpiece in your mouth. (See Figure O ) If you still do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle after repeating the above steps: Throw away the SPIRIVA capsule. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button and check the center chamber for pieces of the SPIRIVA capsule. SPIRIVA capsule pieces in the center chamber can cause a SPIRIVA capsule not to rattle. Turn your HANDIHALER device upside down and gently, but firmly, tap to remove the SPIRIVA capsule pieces. Call your doctor for instructions. Cleaning your HANDIHALER device : Figure R Clean your HANDIHALER device as needed. (See Figure R ) It takes 24 hours to air dry your HANDIHALER device after you clean it. Do not use cleaning agents or detergents. Do not place your HANDIHALER device in the dishwasher for cleaning. Cleaning Steps: Open the dust cap and mouthpiece. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button. Look in the center chamber for SPIRIVA capsule pieces or powder buildup. If seen, tap out. Rinse your HANDIHALER device with warm water, pressing the green piercing button a few times so that the center chamber and the piercing needle is under the running water. Check that any powder buildup or SPIRIVA capsule pieces are removed. Dry your HANDIHALER device well by tipping the excess water out on a paper towel. Air-dry afterwards, leaving the dust cap, mouthpiece, and base open by fully spreading it out so that it dries completely. Do not use a hair dryer to dry your HANDIHALER device. Do not use your HANDIHALER device when it is wet. If needed, you may clean the outside of the mouthpiece with a clean damp cloth. Helpful Hints to help ensure that you are properly taking your full daily dose of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER: Press the green piercing button 1 time; Breathe in 2 times; Breathe out completely before each of the 2 inhalations. Always use the new HANDIHALER device provided with your medicine. Keep your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up when pressing the green piercing button. Press the green piercing button 1 time to pierce the SPIRIVA capsule. Do not breathe out into your HANDIHALER device. Keep your HANDIHALER device in a horizontal position and keep your head upright, looking straight ahead, when breathing in. Check the center chamber of your HANDIHALER device for SPIRIVA capsule pieces or powder build-up. If pieces or powder are seen, tap out before use. Clean your HANDIHALER as needed and dry thoroughly.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Not for acute use: Not a rescue medication ( 5.1 ) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. ( 5.2 ) Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs ( 5.3 ) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Not for Acute Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and should not be used for relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. 5.2 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. In addition, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. 5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled medicines, including SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. Treatment with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be stopped and other treatments considered. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.6 Renal Impairment As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (>5% incidence in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials) were upper respiratory tract infection, dry mouth, sinusitis, pharyngitis, non-specific chest pain, urinary tract infection, dyspepsia, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. 6-Month to 1-Year Trials The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 2,663 patients. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1,308 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran's Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected. The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention. Four multicenter, 1-year, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of \u22653% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by \u22651%. The frequency of corresponding reactions in the ipratropium-controlled trials is included for comparison.

Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group at a frequency of 1% to 3% in the placebo-controlled trials where the rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, leg pain; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: dysphonia, paresthesia; Gastrointestinal System Disorders: gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), gastroesophageal reflux, stomatitis (including ulcerative stomatitis); Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia; Musculoskeletal System Disorders: skeletal pain; Cardiac Events: angina pectoris (including aggravated angina pectoris); Psychiatric Disorder: depression; Infections: herpes zoster; Respiratory System Disorder (Upper): laryngitis; Vision Disorder: cataract. In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% were atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, angioedema, and urinary retention. In the 1-year trials, the incidence of dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection increased with age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Two multicenter, 6-month, controlled studies evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. The adverse reactions and the incidence rates were similar to those seen in the 1-year controlled trials. 4-Year Trial The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 5,992 COPD patients in a 4-year placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, 2,986 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age range from 40 to 88 years, was 75% male, 90% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 40%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. When the adverse reactions were analyzed with a frequency of \u22653% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by \u22651%, adverse reactions included (SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, placebo): pharyngitis (12.5%, 10.8%), sinusitis (6.5%, 5.3%), headache (5.7%, 4.5%), constipation (5.1%, 3.7%), dry mouth (5.1%, 2.7%), depression (4.4%, 3.3%), insomnia (4.4%, 3.0%), and arthralgia (4.2%, 3.1%). Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed that were reported more frequently in COPD patients treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER than placebo include: dehydration, skin ulcer, stomatitis, gingivitis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dry skin, skin infection, and joint swelling. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for potential anticholinergic side effects ( 2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited human data with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. Based on animal reproduction studies, no structural abnormalities were observed when tiotropium was administered by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 790 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID). Increased post-implantation loss was observed in rats and rabbits administered tiotropium at maternally toxic doses 430 times and 40 times the MRHDID, respectively [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In 2 separate embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received tiotropium during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 790 and 8 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 1,471 and 7 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). No evidence of structural abnormalities was observed in rats or rabbits. However, in rats, tiotropium caused fetal resorption, litter loss, decreases in the number of live pups at birth and the mean pup weights, and a delay in pup sexual maturation at tiotropium doses of approximately 40 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 78 mcg/kg/day). In rabbits, tiotropium caused an increase in post-implantation loss at a tiotropium dose of approximately 430 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 400 mcg/kg/day). Such effects were not observed at approximately 5 and 95 times the MRHDID, respectively (on a mcg/m 2 basis at inhalation doses of 9 and 88 mcg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiotropium in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Tiotropium is present in milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The distribution of tiotropium bromide into milk was investigated after a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg to lactating rats. Tiotropium and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations above those in plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is not indicated for use in children. The safety and effectiveness of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Based on available data, no adjustment of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER dosage in geriatric patients is warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Of the total number of patients who received SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in the 1-year clinical trials, 426 were <65 years, 375 were 65 to 74 years, and 105 were \u226575 years of age. Within each age subgroup, there were no differences between the proportion of patients with adverse events in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and the comparator groups for most events. Dry mouth increased with age in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group (differences from placebo were 9.0%, 17.1%, and 16.2% in the aforementioned age subgroups). A higher frequency of constipation and urinary tract infections with increasing age was observed in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group in the placebo-controlled studies. The differences from placebo for constipation were 0%, 1.8%, and 7.8% for each of the age groups. The differences from placebo for urinary tract infections were \u20130.6%, 4.6%, and 4.5%. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed among these groups. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied."

In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, bilateral conjunctivitis and dry mouth were seen following repeated once-daily inhalation of 141 mcg of tiotropium. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. Accidental Ingestion Acute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of SPIRIVA capsules is unlikely since it is not well-absorbed systemically. A case of overdose has been reported from postmarketing experience. A female patient was reported to have inhaled 30 capsules over a 2.5 day period, and developed altered mental status, tremors, abdominal pain, and severe constipation. The patient was hospitalized, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was discontinued, and the constipation was treated with an enema. The patient recovered and was discharged on the same day."

      "11 DESCRIPTION SPIRIVA HANDIHALER consists of SPIRIVA capsules and a HANDIHALER device. Each light green, hard gelatin SPIRIVA capsule contains a dry powder consisting of 18 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 22.5 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate) blended with lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The contents of SPIRIVA capsules are intended for oral inhalation only, and are intended for administration only with the HANDIHALER device. The active component of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is tiotropium. The drug substance, tiotropium bromide monohydrate, is an anticholinergic with specificity for muscarinic receptors. It is chemically described as (1\u03b1, 2\u03b2, 4\u03b2, 5\u03b1, 7\u03b2)-7-[(Hydroxydi-2-thienylacetyl)oxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azoniatricyclo[3.3.1.0 2,4 ]nonane bromide monohydrate. It is a synthetic, non-chiral, quaternary ammonium compound. Tiotropium bromide is a white or yellowish white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in methanol. The structural formula is: Tiotropium bromide (monohydrate) has a molecular mass of 490.4 and a molecular formula of C 19 H 22 NO 4 S 2 Br \u2219 H 2 O. The HANDIHALER device is an inhalation device used to inhale the dry powder contained in the SPIRIVA capsule. The dry powder is delivered from the HANDIHALER device at flow rates as low as 20 L/min. Under standardized in vitro testing, the HANDIHALER device delivers a mean of 10.4 mcg tiotropium when tested at a flow rate of 39 L/min for 3.1 seconds (2 L total). In a study of 26 adult patients with COPD and severely compromised lung function [mean FEV 1 1.02 L (range 0.45 to 2.24 L); 37.6% of predicted (range 16% to 65%)], the median peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the HANDIHALER device was 30.0 L/min (range 20.4 to 45.6 L/min). The amount of drug delivered to the lungs will vary depending on patient factors such as inspiratory flow and peak inspiratory flow through the HANDIHALER device, which may vary from patient to patient, and may vary with the exposure time of the SPIRIVA capsule outside the blister pack.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 to M 5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M 3 -receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial using tiotropium dry powder for inhalation that enrolled 198 patients with COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval of 30 to 60 msec was higher in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group as compared with placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%) patients vs. 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs. 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical studies with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. The effect of tiotropium dry powder for inhalation on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers. Subjects received tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for tiotropium dry powder for inhalation 18 mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec or QTc changes from baseline of \u226560 msec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tiotropium is administered by dry powder inhalation. Some of the pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than recommended for therapy. A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with COPD evaluating once-daily tiotropium delivered from the RESPIMAT inhaler (5 mcg) and as inhalation powder (18 mcg) from the HANDIHALER device resulted in a similar systemic exposure between the two products. Absorption Following dry powder inhalation by young healthy volunteers, the absolute bioavailability of 19.5% suggests that the fraction reaching the lung is highly bioavailable. Oral solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2-3%. Food is not expected to influence the absorption of tiotropium. Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 7 minutes after inhalation. Distribution Tiotropium is 72% bound to plasma protein and had a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg after intravenous administration to young healthy volunteers. Local concentrations in the lung are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after intravenous administration in young healthy volunteers. After chronic once-daily dry powder inhalation by COPD patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached by day 7 with no accumulation thereafter. Metabolism The extent of metabolism is small. This is evident from a urinary excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the alcohol N-methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, neither of which binds to muscarinic receptors. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving 25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase II metabolites. This enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small part of the administered dose. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations did not inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Excretion Intravenously administered tiotropium bromide is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After dry powder inhalation to COPD patients at steady state, urinary excretion was 7% (1.3 mcg) of the unchanged dose over 24 hours. The renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating secretion into the urine. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (365 mL/min in COPD patients <65 years to 271 mL/min in COPD patients \u226565 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC 0-6,ss and C max,ss values following administration via HANDIHALER device. Renal Impairment Following 4-week SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT once daily dosing in patients with COPD, mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60-<90 mL/min) resulted in 6-23% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 6-17% higher C max,ss values; moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-<60 mL/min) resulted in 54-57% higher AUC 0-6,ss and 15-31% higher C max,ss values compared to COPD patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min). There is insufficient data for tiotropium exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) following inhalation of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER or SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. However AUC 0-4 and C max were 94% and 52% higher, respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment following intravenous infusion of tiotropium bromide. Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium were not studied. Drug Interactions An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC 0-4h , a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the C max and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium. Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The SPIRIVA HANDIHALER (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) clinical development program consisted of six Phase 3 studies in 2,663 patients with COPD (1,308 receiving SPIRIVA HANDIHALER): two 1-year, placebo-controlled studies, two 6-month, placebo-controlled studies and two 1-year, ipratropium-controlled studies. These studies enrolled patients who had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, were 40 years of age or older, had a history of smoking greater than 10 pack-years, had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) less than or equal to 60% or 65% of predicted, and a ratio of FEV 1 /FVC of less than or equal to 0.7. In these studies, SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, administered once-daily in the morning, provided improvement in lung function (FEV 1 ), with peak effect occurring within 3 hours following the first dose. Two additional trials evaluated exacerbations: a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 1,829 COPD patients in a US Veterans Affairs setting and a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial of 5,992 COPD patients. Long-term effects on lung function and other outcomes, were also evaluated in the 4-year multicenter trial. 6-Month to 1-Year Effects on Lung Function In the 1-year, placebo-controlled trials, the mean improvement in FEV 1 at 30 minutes was 0.13 liters (13%) with a peak improvement of 0.24 liters (24%) relative to baseline after the first dose (Day 1). Further improvements in FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were observed with pharmacodynamic steady state reached by Day 8 with once-daily treatment. The mean peak improvement in FEV 1 , relative to baseline, was 0.28 to 0.31 liters (28% to 31%), after 1 week (Day 8) of once-daily treatment. Improvement of lung function was maintained for 24 hours after a single dose and consistently maintained over the 1-year treatment period with no evidence of tolerance. In the two 6-month, placebo-controlled trials, serial spirometric evaluations were performed throughout daytime hours in Trial A (12 hours) and limited to 3 hours in Trial B. The serial FEV 1 values over 12 hours (Trial A) are displayed in Figure 1. These trials further support the improvement in pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, which persisted over the spirometric observational period. Effectiveness was maintained for 24 hours after administration over the 6-month treatment period. Figure 1 Mean FEV 1 Over Time (prior to and after administration of study drug) on Days 1 and 169 for Trial A (a Six-Month Placebo-Controlled Study) Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 169, a total of 183 and 149 patients in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and placebo groups, respectively, completed the trial. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Day 1 Day 169 Results of each of the 1-year ipratropium-controlled trials were similar to the results of the 1-year placebo-controlled trials. The results of one of these trials are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Mean FEV 1 Over Time (0 to 6 hours post-dose) on Days 1 and 92, Respectively for One of the Two Ipratropium-Controlled Studies Means adjusted for center, treatment, and baseline effect. On Day 92 (primary endpoint), a total of 151 and 69 patients in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and ipratropium groups, respectively, completed through 3 months of observation. The data for the remaining patients were imputed using the last observation or least favorable observation carried forward. Day 1 Day 92 A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in 105 patients with COPD demonstrated that bronchodilation was maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval in comparison to placebo, regardless of whether SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was administered in the morning or in the evening. Throughout each week of the 1-year treatment period in the two placebo-controlled trials, patients taking SPIRIVA HANDIHALER had a reduced requirement for the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists. Reduction in the use of rescue short-acting beta 2 -agonists, as compared to placebo, was demonstrated in one of the two 6-month studies. Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 2 4-Year Effects on Lung Function A 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial involving 5,992 COPD patients was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER on disease progression (rate of decline in FEV 1 ). Patients were permitted to use all respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. The patients were 40 to 88 years of age, 75% male, and 90% Caucasian with a diagnosis of COPD and a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of 39% predicted (range = 9% to 76%) at study entry. There was no difference between the groups in either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, yearly rate of decline in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , as demonstrated by similar slopes of FEV 1 decline over time (Figure 3). SPIRIVA HANDIHALER maintained improvements in trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 (adjusted means over time: 87 to 103 mL) throughout the 4 years of the study (Figure 3). Figure 3 Trough (pre-dose) FEV 1 Mean Values at Each Time Point Repeated measure ANOVA was used to estimate means. Means are adjusted for baseline measurements. Baseline trough FEV 1 (observed mean) = 1.12. Patients with \u22653 acceptable pulmonary function tests after Day 30 and non-missing baseline value were included in the analysis. Figure 3 Exacerbations The effect of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in two clinical trials: a 4-year clinical trial described above and a 6-month clinical trial of 1,829 COPD patients in a Veterans Affairs setting. In the 6-month trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as a complex of respiratory symptoms (increase or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at least 3 days requiring treatment with antibiotics, systemic steroids, or hospitalization. The population had an age ranging from 40 to 90 years with 99% males, 91% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted of 36% (range = 8% to 93%). Patients were permitted to use respiratory medications (including short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled and systemic steroids, and theophyllines) other than inhaled anticholinergics. In the 6-month trial, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with COPD exacerbation and the proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER significantly reduced the proportion of COPD patients who experienced exacerbations compared to placebo (27.9% vs. 32.3%, respectively; Odds Ratio (OR) (tiotropium/placebo) = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.037). The proportion of patients with hospitalization due to COPD exacerbations in patients who used SPIRIVA HANDIHALER compared to placebo was 7.0% vs. 9.5%, respectively; OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.51, 1.01; p = 0.056. Exacerbations were evaluated as a secondary outcome in the 4-year multicenter trial. In this trial, COPD exacerbations were defined as an increase or new onset of more than one of the following respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, sputum purulence, wheezing, dyspnea) with a duration of three or more days requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) steroids. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER significantly reduced the risk of an exacerbation by 14% (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.81, 0.91; p<0.001) and reduced the risk of exacerbation-related hospitalization by 14% (HR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.95; p<0.002) compared to placebo. The median time to first exacerbation was delayed from 12.5 months (95% CI = 11.5, 13.8) in the placebo group to 16.7 months (95% CI = 14.9, 17.9) in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group. All-Cause Mortality In the 4-year placebo-controlled lung-function trial described above, all-cause mortality compared to placebo was assessed. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality rates between SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and placebo. The all-cause mortality of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was also compared to tiotropium inhalation spray 5 mcg (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg) in an additional long-term, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy active-controlled study with an observation period up to 3 years. All-cause mortality was similar between SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and SPIRIVA RESPIMAT."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Not for Acute Use: Instruct patients that SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator and should not be used for immediate relief of breathing problems (i.e., as a rescue medication). Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Advise patient to immediately discontinue treatment and consult a physician should any of these signs or symptoms develop.

SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is a prescription medicine used each day (a maintenance medicine) to control symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER helps make your lungs work better for 24 hours. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER relaxes your airways and helps keep them open. You may start to feel like it is easier to breathe on the first day, but it may take longer for you to feel the full effects of the medicine. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER works best and may help make it easier to breathe when you use it every day. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER reduces the likelihood of flare-ups and worsening of COPD symptoms (COPD exacerbations). A COPD exacerbation is defined as an increase or new onset of more than one COPD symptom such as cough, mucus, shortness of breath, and wheezing that requires medicine beyond your rescue medicine. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is not a rescue medicine and should not be used for treating sudden breathing problems. Your doctor may give you other medicine to use for sudden breathing problems.

      "Instructions for Use SPIRIVA\u00ae (speh REE vah) HANDIHALER\u00ae (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. Important Information about using your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the HANDIHALER device and inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Do not use your HANDIHALER device to take any other medicine. First read the Patient Information, then read these Instructions for Use before you start to use SPIRIVA HANDIHALER and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. Becoming familiar with your HANDIHALER device and SPIRIVA capsules: Your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER comes with SPIRIVA capsules in blister packaging and a HANDIHALER device. Use the new HANDIHALER device provided with your medicine. Figure A The parts of your HANDIHALER device include: (See Figure A ) dust cap (lid) mouthpiece mouthpiece ridge base green piercing button center chamber air intake vents Figure B Each SPIRIVA capsule is packaged in a blister. (See Figure B ) Figure C Each SPIRIVA capsule contains only a small amount of powder. (See Figure C ) This is 1 full dose. Do not open the SPIRIVA capsule or it may not work. Taking your full daily dose of medicine requires 4 main steps. Step 1. Opening your HANDIHALER device: Figure D After removing your HANDIHALER device from the pouch: Open the dust cap (lid) by pressing the green piercing button. (See Figure D ) Figure E Pull the dust cap (lid) upwards away from the base to expose the mouthpiece. (See Figure E ) Figure F Open the mouthpiece by pulling the mouthpiece ridge up and away from the base so the center chamber is showing. (See Figure F ) Step 2. Inserting the SPIRIVA capsule into your HANDIHALER device: Figure G Each day, separate only 1 of the blisters from the blister card by tearing along the perforated line. (See Figure G ) Figure H Remove the SPIRIVA capsule from the blister: Do not cut the foil or use sharp instruments to take out the SPIRIVA capsule from the blister. Bend 1 of the blister corners with an arrow and separate the aluminum foil layers. Peel back the printed foil until you see the whole SPIRIVA capsule. (See Figure H ) If you have opened more than 1 blister to the air, the extra SPIRIVA capsule should not be used and should be thrown away. Figure I Place the SPIRIVA capsule in the center chamber of your HANDIHALER device. (See Figure I ) Figure J Close the mouthpiece firmly against the gray base until you hear a click. Leave the dust cap (lid) open. (See Figure J ) Step 3. Piercing the SPIRIVA capsule: Figure K Hold your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up. (See Figure K ) Press the green piercing button once until it is flat (flush) against the base, then release. This is how you make holes in the SPIRIVA capsule so that you get your medicine when you breathe in. Do not press the green button more than one time. Do not shake your HANDIHALER device. The piercing of the SPIRIVA capsule may produce small gelatin pieces. Some of these small pieces may pass through the screen of your HANDIHALER device into your mouth or throat when you breathe in your medicine. This is normal. The small pieces of gelatin should not harm you. Step 4. Taking your full daily dose (2 inhalations from the same SPIRIVA capsule): Figure L Breathe out completely in 1 breath , emptying your lungs of any air. (See Figure L ) Important: Do not breathe into your HANDIHALER device. Figure M With your next breath, take your medicine: Hold your head in an upright position while you are looking straight ahead. (See Figure M ) Raise your HANDIHALER device to your mouth in a horizontal position. Do not block the air intake vents. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Breathe in deeply until your lungs are full. You should hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule vibrate (rattle). (See Figure M ) Hold your breath for a few seconds and, at the same time, take your HANDIHALER device out of your mouth. Breathe normally again. The rattle tells you that you breathed in correctly. If you do not hear or feel a rattle, see the section, \" If you do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine .\" Figure N To get your full daily dose, you must again, breathe out completely (See Figure N ) and for a second time, breathe in (See Figure O ) from the same SPIRIVA capsule. Important: Do not press the green piercing button again. Figure O Remember: To get your full medicine dose each day, you must breathe in 2 times from the same SPIRIVA capsule. Make sure you breathe out completely each time before you breathe in from your HANDIHALER device. Caring for and storing your SPIRIVA HANDIHALER : Figure P After taking your daily dose, open the mouthpiece and tip out the used SPIRIVA capsule into your trash can, without touching it. Remove any SPIRIVA capsule pieces or SPIRIVA powder buildup by turning your HANDIHALER device upside down and gently, but firmly, tapping it. (See Figure P ) Then, close the mouthpiece and dustcap for storage. Do not store your HANDIHALER device and SPIRIVA capsules (blisters) in a damp moist place. Always store SPIRIVA capsules in the sealed blisters. If you do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle as you breathe in your medicine: Figure Q Do not press the green piercing button again. Hold your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up and tap your HANDIHALER device gently on a table. (See Figure Q ) Check to see that the mouthpiece is completely closed. Breathe out completely before deeply breathing in again with the mouthpiece in your mouth. (See Figure O ) If you still do not hear or feel the SPIRIVA capsule rattle after repeating the above steps: Throw away the SPIRIVA capsule. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button and check the center chamber for pieces of the SPIRIVA capsule. SPIRIVA capsule pieces in the center chamber can cause a SPIRIVA capsule not to rattle. Turn your HANDIHALER device upside down and gently, but firmly, tap to remove the SPIRIVA capsule pieces. Call your doctor for instructions. Cleaning your HANDIHALER device : Figure R Clean your HANDIHALER device as needed. (See Figure R ) It takes 24 hours to air dry your HANDIHALER device after you clean it. Do not use cleaning agents or detergents. Do not place your HANDIHALER device in the dishwasher for cleaning. Cleaning Steps: Open the dust cap and mouthpiece. Open the base by lifting the green piercing button. Look in the center chamber for SPIRIVA capsule pieces or powder buildup. If seen, tap out. Rinse your HANDIHALER device with warm water, pressing the green piercing button a few times so that the center chamber and the piercing needle is under the running water. Check that any powder buildup or SPIRIVA capsule pieces are removed. Dry your HANDIHALER device well by tipping the excess water out on a paper towel. Air-dry afterwards, leaving the dust cap, mouthpiece, and base open by fully spreading it out so that it dries completely. Do not use a hair dryer to dry your HANDIHALER device. Do not use your HANDIHALER device when it is wet. If needed, you may clean the outside of the mouthpiece with a clean damp cloth. Helpful Hints to help ensure that you are properly taking your full daily dose of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER: Press the green piercing button 1 time; Breathe in 2 times; Breathe out completely before each of the 2 inhalations. Always use the new HANDIHALER device provided with your medicine. Keep your HANDIHALER device with the mouthpiece pointed up when pressing the green piercing button. Press the green piercing button 1 time to pierce the SPIRIVA capsule. Do not breathe out into your HANDIHALER device. Keep your HANDIHALER device in a horizontal position and keep your head upright, looking straight ahead, when breathing in. Check the center chamber of your HANDIHALER device for SPIRIVA capsule pieces or powder build-up. If pieces or powder are seen, tap out before use. Clean your HANDIHALER as needed and dry thoroughly.
