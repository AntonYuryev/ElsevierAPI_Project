    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tardive Dyskinesia (TD), Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS), and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Avoid concomitant use of other drugs known to cause TD/EPS/NMS and avoid use in patients with Parkinson's disease. If symptoms occur, discontinue Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets and seek immediate medical attention. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 7.1 , 7.2 ) Depression and suicidal ideation/suicide : Avoid use. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Tardive Dyskinesia Metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face or tongue, and sometimes of the trunk and/or extremities. Movements may be choreoathetoic in appearance. The risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increases with the duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD. Additionally, the risk of developing TD is increased among the elderly, especially elderly women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 )] , and in patients with diabetes mellitus. Due to the risk of developing TD, avoid treatment with Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets for longer than 12 weeks and reduce the dosage in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Discontinue Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets immediately in patients who develop signs and symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets is withdrawn. Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long-term course of TD is unknown. Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets is contraindicated in patients with a history of TD [see Contraindications (4) ]. Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets in patients receiving other drugs that can cause TD (e.g., antipsychotics). 5.2 Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms In addition to TD, metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and to discontinue Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as acute dystonic reactions, occurred in patients treated with metoclopramide dosages of 30 to 40 mg daily. Such reactions occurred more frequently in adults less than 30 years of age and at higher than recommended dosages. EPS occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adults (Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets is not approved for use in pediatric patients). Symptoms can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after starting metoclopramide. Symptoms included involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions were present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate may be used to treat these adverse reactions. Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets in patients receiving other drugs that can cause EPS (e.g., antipsychotics). Parkinsonism symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies) have occurred after starting metoclopramide, more commonly within the first 6 months, but also after longer periods. Symptoms generally have subsided within 2 to 3 months following discontinuation of metoclopramide. Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets in patients with Parkinson's disease and other patients being treated with antiparkinsonian drugs due to potential exacerbation of symptoms. Avoid treatment with Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets for more than 12 weeks [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Motor restlessness (akathisia) has developed and consisted of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, and foot tapping. If symptoms resolve, consider restarting at a lower dosage. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Metoclopramide may cause a potentially fatal symptom complex called Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). NMS has been reported in association with metoclopramide overdosage and concomitant treatment with another drug associated with NMS. Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets in patients receiving other drugs associated with NMS, including typical and atypical antipsychotics. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and manifestations of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Patients with such symptoms should be evaluated immediately. In the diagnostic evaluation, consider the presence of other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever, serotonin syndrome and primary central nervous system pathology. Management of NMS includes: Immediate discontinuation of Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring. Treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. 5.4 Depression Depression has occurred in metoclopramide-treated patients with and without a history of depression. Symptoms have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets use in patients with a history of depression. 5.5 Hypertension Metoclopramide may elevate blood pressure. In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, avoid use in patients with hypertension or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors [see Drugs Interactions (7.1) ] . There are also clinical reports of hypertensive crises in some patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas [see Contraindications (4) ] . Discontinue Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets in any patient with a rapid rise in blood pressure. 5.6 Fluid Retention Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, patients with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. Discontinue Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets if any of these adverse reactions occur. 5.7 Hyperprolactinemia As with other dopamine D2 antagonists, metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, including metoclopramide. Hyperprolactinemia may potentially stimulate prolactin-dependent breast cancer. However, some clinical studies and epidemiology studies have not shown an association between administration of dopamine D2 antagonists and tumorigenesis in humans [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 5.8 Effects on the Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Concomitant use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants or drugs associated with EPS may increase this effect (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics). Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets or the interacting drug, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

Intervention Reduce the Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] . Examples quinidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and paroxetine. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Clinical Impact Increased risk of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Intervention Avoid concomitant use. Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact Increased risk of CNS depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Intervention Avoid Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets or the interacting drug, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. Examples alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates and anxiolytics. Drugs that Impair Gastrointestinal Motility Clinical Impact Decreased systemic absorption of metoclopramide. Intervention Monitor for reduced therapeutic effect. Examples antiperistaltic antidiarrheal drugs, anticholinergic drugs, and opiates. Dopaminergic Agonists and Other Drugs that Increase Dopamine Concentrations Clinical Impact Decreased therapeutic effect of metoclopramide, a D2 antagonist, due to opposing effects on dopamine. Intervention Monitor for reduced therapeutic effect. Examples Apomorphine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine. 7.2 Effects of Metoclopramide on Other Drugs Table 4 displays the effects of metoclopramide on other drugs. Dopaminergic Agonists and Other Drugs that Increase Dopamine Concentrations: Clinical Impact Opposing effects of metoclopramide and the interacting drug on dopamine. Potential exacerbation of symptoms (e.g., parkinsonian symptoms). Intervention Avoid concomitant use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Examples Apomorphine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine. Succinylcholine, Mivacurium: Clinical Impact Metoclopramide inhibits plasma cholinesterase leading to enhanced neuromuscular blockade. Intervention Monitor for signs and symptoms of prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Drugs with Absorption Altered due to Increased Gastrointestinal Motility: Clinical Impact The effect of metoclopramide on other drugs is variable. Increased gastrointestinal (GI) motility by metoclopramide may impact absorption of other drugs leading to decreased or increased drug exposure. Intervention Drugs with Decreased Absorption (e.g., digoxin, atovaquone, posaconazole oral suspension*, fosfomycin) : Monitor for reduced therapeutic effect of the interacting drug. For digoxin monitor therapeutic drug concentrations and increase the digoxin dose as needed (see prescribing information for digoxin). Drugs with Increased Absorption (e.g., sirolimus, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) : Monitor therapeutic drug concentrations and adjust the dose as needed. See prescribing information for the interacting drug. Insulin Clinical Impact Increased GI motility by metoclopramide may increase delivery of food to the intestines and increase blood glucose. Intervention Monitor blood glucose and adjust insulin dosage regimen as needed. * Interaction does not apply to posaconazole delayed-release tablets"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies, including retrospective cohort studies, national registry studies, and meta-analyses, do not report an increased risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes with use of metoclopramide during pregnancy. There are potential risks to the neonate following exposure in utero to metoclopramide during delivery (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of metoclopramide to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures about 6 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Metoclopramide crosses the placental barrier and may cause extrapyramidal signs and methemoglobinemia in neonates with maternal administration during delivery. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal signs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of oral metoclopramide during organogenesis in pregnant rats at about 6 times the MRHD calculated on body surface area and in pregnant rabbits at about 12 times the MRHD calculated on body surface area. No evidence of adverse developmental effects due to metoclopramide were observed. 8.6 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published data report the presence of metoclopramide in human milk in variable amounts. Breastfed infants exposed to metoclopramide have experienced gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including intestinal discomfort and increased intestinal gas formation (see Data) . Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] ; however, the published data are not adequate to support drug effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding neonates because metoclopramide may cause extrapyramidal signs (dystonias) and methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data In published clinical studies, the estimated amount of metoclopramide received by the breastfed infant was less than 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. In one study, the estimated daily amount of metoclopramide received by infants from breast milk ranged from 6 to 24 mcg/kg/day in early puerperium (3 to 9 days postpartum) and from 1 to 13 mcg/kg/day at 8 to 12 weeks postpartum. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets is not recommended for use in pediatric patients due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates. The safety and effectiveness of Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric patients than in adults [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, making them more susceptible to methemoglobinemia, a possible side effect of metoclopramide use in neonates [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, including tardive dyskinesia (TD), may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function and may be more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide; therefore, consider a reduced dosage of METOZOLOV ODT in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment The clearance of metoclopramide is decreased and the systemic exposure is increased in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Reduce the Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets dosage in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL/minute), including those receiving hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have reduced systemic metoclopramide clearance (by approximately 50%) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. The resulting increase in metoclopramide blood concentrations increases the risk of adverse reactions. There are no pharmacokinetic data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Reduce Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets dosage in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] . There is no dosage adjustment required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). In addition, metoclopramide, by producing a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, may increase the risk of fluid retention in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for the occurrence of fluid retention and volume overload. 8.9 NADH-Cytochrome b5 Reductase Deficiency Metoclopramide-treated patients with NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency are at an increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia and/or sulfhemoglobinemia. For patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency the metoclopramide-induced methemoglobinemia, methylene blue treatment is not recommended. Methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal [see Overdosage (10) ] . 8.10 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Metoclopramide is a substrate of CYP2D6. The elimination of metoclopramide may be slowed in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (compared to patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers); possibly increasing the risk of dystonic and other adverse reactions to Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets dosage in patients who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. The exact mechanism of action of metoclopramide in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis has not been fully established. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Gastroesophageal Reflux In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), single oral doses of Reglan produced dose-related increases in LESP. Effects began at about 5 mg and increased through 20 mg. The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasted about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasted between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying was observed with single oral doses of 10 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Unless otherwise specified the PK of metoclopramide described below was obtained using other oral formulations of metoclopramide. Absorption Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide was 80% \u00b1 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Following Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets tablet administration, the time reported between placing the tablet on the tongue and it completely disintegrated into fine particles was approximately one minute (with a range of 10 seconds to 14 minutes) in two clinical trials (N = 96) with a mean \u00b1 SD being 77 \u00b1 111 seconds and a median of 54 seconds [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Peak plasma concentrations occurred at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state. In a single dose study of 12 subjects showed that the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg of metoclopramide (5 times the maximum recommended single dose of Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets). Cmax increased linearly with dose; Tmax remained the same; whole body clearance was unchanged; and the elimination rate remained the same. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide. The pharmacokinetic characteristics following single oral administration of 10 mg Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets under fasting conditions are shown in Table 5. Table 5 Mean (\u00b1 SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Healthy Subjects Following a Single Oral Dose of 10 mg Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Treatment C max (ng/mL) T max (h)* AUC 0-inf (ng*h/mL) Single 10 mg Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets (N=41) 28\u00b17.4 2.0 (0.7 to 4.0) 268\u00b172.6 *presented as median (range). Effect of Food When Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets was taken immediately after a high-fat meal (approximately 900 total calories based on the composition being 150 protein calories, 250 carbohydrate calories and 500 fat calories), the Cmax was 17% lower than when taken after an overnight fast. The Tmax increased from about 1.8 hours under fasted conditions to 3 hours when taken immediately after a high-fat meal. The extent of metoclopramide absorbed (area under the curve) was comparable whether Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets was administered with or without food. The clinical relevance of a lower Cmax with a high-fat meal is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Metoclopramide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. Elimination The average elimination half-life of metoclopramide in subjects with normal renal function was 5 to 6 hours Metabolism Metoclopramide undergoes enzymatic metabolism via oxidation as well as glucuronide and sulfate conjugation reactions in the liver. Monodeethylmetoclopramide, a major oxidative metabolite, is formed primarily by CYP2D6, an enzyme subject to genetic variability [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.9 )] . Excretion Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hours. After oral administration of 10 or 20 mg, a mean of 18% and 22% of the dose, respectively, was recovered as free metoclopramide in urine within 36 hours. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment In a study of 24 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (moderate, severe, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis), the systemic exposure (AUC) of metoclopramide in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment was about 2-fold the AUC in subjects with normal renal function. The AUC of metoclopramide in patients with ESRD on dialysis was about 3.5-fold the AUC in subjects with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a group of 8 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the average metoclopramide clearance was reduced by approximately 50% compared to patients with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Metoclopramide on CYP2D6 Substrates Although in vitro studies suggest that metoclopramide can inhibit CYP2D6, metoclopramide is unlikely to interact with CYP2D6 substrates in vivo at therapeutically relevant concentrations.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. The exact mechanism of action of metoclopramide in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis has not been fully established. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Gastroesophageal Reflux In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), single oral doses of Reglan produced dose-related increases in LESP. Effects began at about 5 mg and increased through 20 mg. The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasted about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasted between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying was observed with single oral doses of 10 mg."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Unless otherwise specified the PK of metoclopramide described below was obtained using other oral formulations of metoclopramide. Absorption Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide was 80% \u00b1 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Following Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets tablet administration, the time reported between placing the tablet on the tongue and it completely disintegrated into fine particles was approximately one minute (with a range of 10 seconds to 14 minutes) in two clinical trials (N = 96) with a mean \u00b1 SD being 77 \u00b1 111 seconds and a median of 54 seconds [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Peak plasma concentrations occurred at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state. In a single dose study of 12 subjects showed that the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg of metoclopramide (5 times the maximum recommended single dose of Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets). Cmax increased linearly with dose; Tmax remained the same; whole body clearance was unchanged; and the elimination rate remained the same. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide. The pharmacokinetic characteristics following single oral administration of 10 mg Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets under fasting conditions are shown in Table 5. Table 5 Mean (\u00b1 SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Healthy Subjects Following a Single Oral Dose of 10 mg Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Treatment C max (ng/mL) T max (h)* AUC 0-inf (ng*h/mL) Single 10 mg Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets (N=41) 28\u00b17.4 2.0 (0.7 to 4.0) 268\u00b172.6 *presented as median (range). Effect of Food When Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets was taken immediately after a high-fat meal (approximately 900 total calories based on the composition being 150 protein calories, 250 carbohydrate calories and 500 fat calories), the Cmax was 17% lower than when taken after an overnight fast. The Tmax increased from about 1.8 hours under fasted conditions to 3 hours when taken immediately after a high-fat meal. The extent of metoclopramide absorbed (area under the curve) was comparable whether Metoclopramide Orally Disintegrating Tablets was administered with or without food. The clinical relevance of a lower Cmax with a high-fat meal is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Metoclopramide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. Elimination The average elimination half-life of metoclopramide in subjects with normal renal function was 5 to 6 hours Metabolism Metoclopramide undergoes enzymatic metabolism via oxidation as well as glucuronide and sulfate conjugation reactions in the liver. Monodeethylmetoclopramide, a major oxidative metabolite, is formed primarily by CYP2D6, an enzyme subject to genetic variability [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.9 )] . Excretion Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hours. After oral administration of 10 or 20 mg, a mean of 18% and 22% of the dose, respectively, was recovered as free metoclopramide in urine within 36 hours. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment In a study of 24 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (moderate, severe, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis), the systemic exposure (AUC) of metoclopramide in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment was about 2-fold the AUC in subjects with normal renal function. The AUC of metoclopramide in patients with ESRD on dialysis was about 3.5-fold the AUC in subjects with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a group of 8 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the average metoclopramide clearance was reduced by approximately 50% compared to patients with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Metoclopramide on CYP2D6 Substrates Although in vitro studies suggest that metoclopramide can inhibit CYP2D6, metoclopramide is unlikely to interact with CYP2D6 substrates in vivo at therapeutically relevant concentrations.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Its mode of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum, and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg. The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces nausea and vomiting by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like L-dopa or apomorphine, which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine. Like the phenothiazines and related drugs, which are also dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide produces sedation and may produce extrapyramidal reactions, although these are comparatively rare ( See WARNINGS ). Metoclopramide inhibits the central and peripheral effects of apomorphine, induces release of prolactin and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated with transient fluid retention. The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose; pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours. Pharmacokinetics Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed. Relative to intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80% \u00b1 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state. In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg. Peak concentrations increase linearly with dose, time to peak concentrations remains the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal function is 5 to 6 hours. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hours. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is present as free or conjugated metoclopramide. The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. Renal impairment affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study with patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, a reduction in creatinine clearance was correlated with a reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance, non-renal clearance, and increase in elimination half-life. The kinetics of metoclopramide in the presence of renal impairment remained linear however. The reduction in clearance as a result of renal impairment suggests that adjustment downward of maintenance dosage should be done to avoid drug accumulation. Adult Pharmacokinetic Data Parameter Value VD (L/kg) ~ 3.5 Plasma protein Binding ~ 30% t \u00bd (hr) 5 to 6 Oral Bioavailability 80% \u00b1 15.5% In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral and intravenous administration are highly variable and a concentration-effect relationship has not been established. There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide in adults and the pediatric population are similar. Although there are insufficient data to support the efficacy of metoclopramide in pediatric patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or cancer chemotherapy \u2013 related nausea and vomiting, its pharmacokinetics have been studied in these patient populations. In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GER received metoclopramide 0.15mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was 2-fold (56.8 \u03bcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the first dose (29 \u03bcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. After the tenth dose, the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hr), half-life (4.1 hr), clearance (0.67 L/h/kg), and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg) of metoclopramide were similar to those observed after the first dose. In the youngest patient (age, 3.5 weeks), metoclopramide half-life after the first and the tenth dose (23.1 and 10.3 hr, respectively) was significantly longer compared to other infants due to reduced clearance. This may be attributed to immature hepatic and renal systems at birth. Single intravenous doses of metoclopramide 0.22 to 0.46 mg/kg (mean, 0.35 mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes to 9 pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 7 to 14 yr) for prophylaxis of cytotoxicinduced vomiting. The metoclopramide plasma concentrations extrapolated to time zero ranged from 65 to 395 mcg/L (mean, 152 mcg/L). The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.4 hr (range, 1.7 to 8.3 hr), 0.56 L/h/kg (range, 0.12 to 1.20 L/h/kg), and 3 L/kg (range, 1 to 4.8 L/kg), respectively. In another study, nine pediatric cancer patients (age range, 1 to 9 yr) received 4 to 5 intravenous infusions (over 30 minutes) of metoclopramide at a dose of 2 mg/kg to control emesis. After the last dose, the peak serum concentrations of metoclopramide ranged from 1060 to 5680 mcg/L. The mean elimination halflife, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.5 hr (range, 2 to 12.5 hr), 0.37 L/h/kg (range, 0.1 to 1.24 L/h/kg), and 1.93 L/kg (range, 0.95 to 5.5 L/kg), respectively."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The use of Metoclopramide Oral Solution is recommended for adults only. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Metoclopramide Oral Solution is indicated as short-term (4 to 12 weeks) therapy for adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux who fail to respond to conventional therapy. The principal effect of metoclopramide is on symptoms of postprandial and daytime heartburn with less observed effect on nocturnal symptoms. If symptoms are confined to particular situations, such as following the evening meal, use of metoclopramide as single doses prior to the provocative situation should be considered, rather than using the drug throughout the day. Healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions has been endoscopically demonstrated at the end of 12-week trial using doses of 15 mg q.i.d. As there is no documented correlation between symptoms and healing of esophageal lesions, patients with documented lesions should be monitored endoscopically. Diabetic Gastroparesis (diabetic gastric stasis) Metoclopramide is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastric stasis. The usual manifestations of delayed gastric emptying (e.g., nausea, vomiting, heartburn, persistent fullness after meals and anorexia) appear to respond to metoclopramide within different time intervals. Significant relief of nausea occurs early and continues to improve over a three-week period. Relief of vomiting and anorexia may precede the relief of abdominal fullness by one week or more."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Metoclopramide should not be used whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous, e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because the drug may cause a hypertensive crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor. Such hypertensive crises may be controlled by phentolamine. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or intolerance to the drug. Metoclopramide should not be used in epileptics or patients receiving other drugs, which are likely to cause extrapyramidal reactions, since the frequency and severity of seizures or extrapyramidal reactions may be increased."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Mental depression has occurred in patients with and without prior history of depression. Symptoms have ranged from mild to severe and have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Metoclopramide should be given to patients with a prior history of depression only if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms, manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at the higher doses. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms should occur, inject 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride intramuscularly, and they usually will subside. Benzatropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions. Parkinsonian-like symptoms have occurred, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment with metoclopramide, but occasionally after longer periods. These symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuance of metoclopramide. Patients with preexisting Parkinson\u2019s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients may experience exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide. Tardive Dyskinesia ( see Boxed Warnings ) Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD. Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramideinduced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn. Metoclopramide itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long-term course of TD is unknown. Therefore, metoclopramide should not be used for the symptomatic control of TD. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS) Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness have not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is used in patients with hypertension. Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, certain patients, especially those with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure, may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. If these side effects occur at any time during metoclopramide therapy, the drug should be discontinued. Adverse reactions, especially those involving the nervous system, may occur after stopping the use of metoclopramide. A small number of patients may experience a withdrawal period after stopping metoclopramide that could include dizziness, nervousness, and/or headaches. Information for Patients The use of metoclopramide oral solution is recommended for adults only. Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be cautioned accordingly. Drug Interactions The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics or tranquilizers. The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 77 -week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to about 40 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactinelevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time. An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative. Pregnancy Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice, and rabbits by the I.V., I.M., S.C., and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established (see OVERDOSAGE ). Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics ). In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, which, in combination with the aforementioned pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to methemoglobinemia (see OVERDOSAGE ). The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS-Extrapyramidal Reactions .) Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metoclopramide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. The risk of developing parkinsonian-like side effects increases with ascending dose. Geriatric patients should receive the lowest dose of metoclopramide that is effective. If parkinsonian-like symptoms develop in a geriatric patient receiving metoclopramide, metoclopramide should generally be discontinued before initiating any specific antiparkinsonian agents (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux ). The elderly may be at greater risk for tardive dyskinesia (see WARNINGS \u2013 Tardive Dyskinesia ). Sedation has been reported in metoclopramide users. Sedation may cause confusion and manifest as over-sedation in the elderly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , PRECAUTIONS - information for patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2013 CNS Effects ). Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2013 USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT ). For these reasons, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased renal functions, concomitant disease, or other drug therapy in the elderly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2013 For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux and USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT ). Other Special Populations Patients with NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency are at an increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia and/or sulfhemoglobinemia when metoclopramide is administered. In patients with G6PD deficiency who experience metoclopramideinduced methemoglobinemia, methylene blue treatment is not recommended (see OVERDOSAGE )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In general, the incidence of adverse reactions correlates with the dose and duration of metoclopramide administration. The following reactions have been reported, although in most instances, data do not permit an estimate of frequency: CNS Effects Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the most commonly prescribed dosage of 10 mg q.i.d. (see PRECAUTIONS ). Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or mental depression with suicidal ideation (see WARNINGS ) occur less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Reactions (EPS) Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus like reactions) and rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine (see WARNINGS ). Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies (see WARNINGS ). Tardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance (see WARNINGS ). Motor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Rare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, altered consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (see WARNINGS ). Endocrine Disturbances Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Cardiovascular Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure, and possible AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Gastrointestinal Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity, characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia, in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates (see OVERDOSAGE ).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions. Symptoms are self-limiting and usually disappear within 24 hours. Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues. Similarly, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of drug. It is unlikely that dosage would need to be adjusted to compensate for losses through dialysis. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations. Unintentional overdose due to misadministration has been reported in infants and children with the use of metoclopramide oral solution. While there was no consistent pattern to the reports associated with these overdoses, events included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy. Methemoglobinemia has occurred in premature and full-term neonates who were given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Other Special Populations )."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Therapy with metoclopramide oral solution should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg metoclopramide orally up to q.i.d. 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment. Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose. Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using q.i.d. therapy at 15 mg/dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Because of the poor correlation between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best guided by endoscopic evaluation. Therapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended. For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with Diabetic Gastroparesis (diabetic gastric stasis) Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well-being upon drug discontinuation. The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration). Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation. USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate. See OVERDOSAGE section for information regarding dialysis. Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal."

Some of the information may be different. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about Metoclopramide? Metoclopramide can cause serious side effects, including: Tardive Dyskinesia (abnormal muscle movements). These movements happen mostly in the face muscles. You can not control these movements. They may not go away even after stopping Metoclopramide. There is no treatment for tardive dyskinesia, but symptoms may lessen or go away over time after you stop taking Metoclopramide. Your chances for getting tardive dyskinesia go up: the longer you take Metoclopramide and the more Metoclopramide you take. You should not take Metoclopramide for more than 12 weeks. if you are older, especially if you are a woman if you have diabetes It is not possible for your doctor to know if you will get tardive dyskinesia if you take Metoclopramide. Call your doctor right away if you get movements you can not stop or control, such as: lip smacking, chewing, or puckering up your mouth frowning or scowling sticking out your tongue blinking and moving your eyes shaking of your arms and legs See the section \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of Metoclopramide?\u201d for more information about side effects. What is Metoclopramide? Metoclopramide is a prescription medicine used: in adults for 4 to 12 weeks to relieve heartburn symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when certain other treatments do not work. Metoclopramide relieves daytime heartburn and heartburn after meals. It also helps ulcers in the esophagus to heal. to relieve symptoms of slow stomach emptying in people with diabetes. Metoclopramide helps treat symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, feeling full long after a meal, and loss of appetite. All these symptoms do not get better at the same time. It is not known if Metoclopramide is safe and works in children. Who should not take Metoclopramide? Do not take Metoclopramide if you: have stomach or intestine problems that could get worse with Metoclopramide, such as bleeding, blockage or a tear in the stomach or bowel wall have an adrenal gland tumor called a pheochromocytoma are allergic to Metoclopramide or anything in it. See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients in Metoclopramide. take medicines that can cause uncontrolled movements, such as medicines for mental illness have seizures What should I tell my doctor before taking Metoclopramide?

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Its mode of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum, and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg. The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces nausea and vomiting by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like L-dopa or apomorphine, which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine. Like the phenothiazines and related drugs, which are also dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide produces sedation and may produce extrapyramidal reactions, although these are comparatively rare ( See WARNINGS ). Metoclopramide inhibits the central and peripheral effects of apomorphine, induces release of prolactin and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated with transient fluid retention. The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose; pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours. Pharmacokinetics Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed. Relative to intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80% \u00b1 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state. In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg. Peak concentrations increase linearly with dose, time to peak concentrations remains the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal function is 5 to 6 hours. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hours. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is present as free or conjugated metoclopramide. The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. Renal impairment affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study with patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, a reduction in creatinine clearance was correlated with a reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance, non-renal clearance, and increase in elimination half-life. The kinetics of metoclopramide in the presence of renal impairment remained linear however. The reduction in clearance as a result of renal impairment suggests that adjustment downward of maintenance dosage should be done to avoid drug accumulation. Adult Pharmacokinetic Data Parameter Value VD (L/kg) ~ 3.5 Plasma protein Binding ~ 30% t \u00bd (hr) 5 to 6 Oral Bioavailability 80% \u00b1 15.5% In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral and intravenous administration are highly variable and a concentration-effect relationship has not been established. There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide in adults and the pediatric population are similar. Although there are insufficient data to support the efficacy of metoclopramide in pediatric patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or cancer chemotherapy \u2013 related nausea and vomiting, its pharmacokinetics have been studied in these patient populations. In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GER received metoclopramide 0.15mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was 2-fold (56.8 \u03bcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the first dose (29 \u03bcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. After the tenth dose, the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hr), half-life (4.1 hr), clearance (0.67 L/h/kg), and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg) of metoclopramide were similar to those observed after the first dose. In the youngest patient (age, 3.5 weeks), metoclopramide half-life after the first and the tenth dose (23.1 and 10.3 hr, respectively) was significantly longer compared to other infants due to reduced clearance. This may be attributed to immature hepatic and renal systems at birth. Single intravenous doses of metoclopramide 0.22 to 0.46 mg/kg (mean, 0.35 mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes to 9 pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 7 to 14 yr) for prophylaxis of cytotoxicinduced vomiting. The metoclopramide plasma concentrations extrapolated to time zero ranged from 65 to 395 mcg/L (mean, 152 mcg/L). The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.4 hr (range, 1.7 to 8.3 hr), 0.56 L/h/kg (range, 0.12 to 1.20 L/h/kg), and 3 L/kg (range, 1 to 4.8 L/kg), respectively. In another study, nine pediatric cancer patients (age range, 1 to 9 yr) received 4 to 5 intravenous infusions (over 30 minutes) of metoclopramide at a dose of 2 mg/kg to control emesis. After the last dose, the peak serum concentrations of metoclopramide ranged from 1060 to 5680 mcg/L. The mean elimination halflife, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.5 hr (range, 2 to 12.5 hr), 0.37 L/h/kg (range, 0.1 to 1.24 L/h/kg), and 1.93 L/kg (range, 0.95 to 5.5 L/kg), respectively."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The use of Metoclopramide Oral Solution is recommended for adults only. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Metoclopramide Oral Solution is indicated as short-term (4 to 12 weeks) therapy for adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux who fail to respond to conventional therapy. The principal effect of metoclopramide is on symptoms of postprandial and daytime heartburn with less observed effect on nocturnal symptoms. If symptoms are confined to particular situations, such as following the evening meal, use of metoclopramide as single doses prior to the provocative situation should be considered, rather than using the drug throughout the day. Healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions has been endoscopically demonstrated at the end of 12-week trial using doses of 15 mg q.i.d. As there is no documented correlation between symptoms and healing of esophageal lesions, patients with documented lesions should be monitored endoscopically. Diabetic Gastroparesis (diabetic gastric stasis) Metoclopramide is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastric stasis. The usual manifestations of delayed gastric emptying (e.g., nausea, vomiting, heartburn, persistent fullness after meals and anorexia) appear to respond to metoclopramide within different time intervals. Significant relief of nausea occurs early and continues to improve over a three-week period. Relief of vomiting and anorexia may precede the relief of abdominal fullness by one week or more."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Metoclopramide should not be used whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous, e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because the drug may cause a hypertensive crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor. Such hypertensive crises may be controlled by phentolamine. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or intolerance to the drug. Metoclopramide should not be used in epileptics or patients receiving other drugs, which are likely to cause extrapyramidal reactions, since the frequency and severity of seizures or extrapyramidal reactions may be increased."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Mental depression has occurred in patients with and without prior history of depression. Symptoms have ranged from mild to severe and have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Metoclopramide should be given to patients with a prior history of depression only if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms, manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at the higher doses. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms should occur, inject 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride intramuscularly, and they usually will subside. Benzatropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions. Parkinsonian-like symptoms have occurred, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment with metoclopramide, but occasionally after longer periods. These symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuance of metoclopramide. Patients with preexisting Parkinson\u2019s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients may experience exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide. Tardive Dyskinesia ( see Boxed Warnings ) Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD. Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramideinduced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn. Metoclopramide itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long-term course of TD is unknown. Therefore, metoclopramide should not be used for the symptomatic control of TD. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS) Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness have not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is used in patients with hypertension. Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, certain patients, especially those with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure, may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. If these side effects occur at any time during metoclopramide therapy, the drug should be discontinued. Adverse reactions, especially those involving the nervous system, may occur after stopping the use of metoclopramide. A small number of patients may experience a withdrawal period after stopping metoclopramide that could include dizziness, nervousness, and/or headaches. Information for Patients The use of metoclopramide oral solution is recommended for adults only. Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be cautioned accordingly. Drug Interactions The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics or tranquilizers. The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 77 -week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to about 40 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactinelevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time. An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative. Pregnancy Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice, and rabbits by the I.V., I.M., S.C., and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established (see OVERDOSAGE ). Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics ). In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, which, in combination with the aforementioned pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to methemoglobinemia (see OVERDOSAGE ). The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS-Extrapyramidal Reactions .) Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metoclopramide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. The risk of developing parkinsonian-like side effects increases with ascending dose. Geriatric patients should receive the lowest dose of metoclopramide that is effective. If parkinsonian-like symptoms develop in a geriatric patient receiving metoclopramide, metoclopramide should generally be discontinued before initiating any specific antiparkinsonian agents (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux ). The elderly may be at greater risk for tardive dyskinesia (see WARNINGS \u2013 Tardive Dyskinesia ). Sedation has been reported in metoclopramide users. Sedation may cause confusion and manifest as over-sedation in the elderly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , PRECAUTIONS - information for patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2013 CNS Effects ). Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2013 USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT ). For these reasons, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased renal functions, concomitant disease, or other drug therapy in the elderly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2013 For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux and USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT ). Other Special Populations Patients with NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency are at an increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia and/or sulfhemoglobinemia when metoclopramide is administered. In patients with G6PD deficiency who experience metoclopramideinduced methemoglobinemia, methylene blue treatment is not recommended (see OVERDOSAGE )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In general, the incidence of adverse reactions correlates with the dose and duration of metoclopramide administration. The following reactions have been reported, although in most instances, data do not permit an estimate of frequency: CNS Effects Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the most commonly prescribed dosage of 10 mg q.i.d. (see PRECAUTIONS ). Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or mental depression with suicidal ideation (see WARNINGS ) occur less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Reactions (EPS) Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus like reactions) and rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine (see WARNINGS ). Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies (see WARNINGS ). Tardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance (see WARNINGS ). Motor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Rare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, altered consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (see WARNINGS ). Endocrine Disturbances Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Cardiovascular Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure, and possible AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Gastrointestinal Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity, characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia, in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates (see OVERDOSAGE ). Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults Allergic Reactions A few cases of rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, especially in patients with a history of asthma. Rarely, angioneurotic edema, including glossal or laryngeal edema. Miscellaneous Visual disturbances. Porphyria."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions. Symptoms are self-limiting and usually disappear within 24 hours. Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues. Similarly, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of drug. It is unlikely that dosage would need to be adjusted to compensate for losses through dialysis. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations. Unintentional overdose due to misadministration has been reported in infants and children with the use of metoclopramide oral solution. While there was no consistent pattern to the reports associated with these overdoses, events included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy. Methemoglobinemia has occurred in premature and full-term neonates who were given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Other Special Populations )."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Therapy with metoclopramide oral solution should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg metoclopramide orally up to q.i.d. 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment. Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose. Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using q.i.d. therapy at 15 mg/dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Because of the poor correlation between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best guided by endoscopic evaluation. Therapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended. For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with Diabetic Gastroparesis (diabetic gastric stasis) Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well-being upon drug discontinuation. The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration). Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation. USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate. See OVERDOSAGE section for information regarding dialysis. Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal."

What is Metoclopramide? Metoclopramide is a prescription medicine used: in adults for 4 to 12 weeks to relieve heartburn symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when certain other treatments do not work. Metoclopramide relieves daytime heartburn and heartburn after meals. It also helps ulcers in the esophagus to heal. to relieve symptoms of slow stomach emptying in people with diabetes. Metoclopramide helps treat symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, feeling full long after a meal, and loss of appetite. All these symptoms do not get better at the same time.
