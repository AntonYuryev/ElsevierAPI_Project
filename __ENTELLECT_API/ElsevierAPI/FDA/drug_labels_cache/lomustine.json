      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pulmonary toxicity : Pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis occurs with Lomustine Capsules. Perform pulmonary function tests prior to treatment and repeat frequently. Permanently discontinue Lomustine Capsules in patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. (5.3) Secondary malignancies : Acute leukemia and myelodysplasia can occur with long-term use. (5.4) Hepatotoxicity : Increased levels of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin can occur with Lomustine Capsules. Monitor liver function. (5.5) Nephrotoxicity : Can cause renal failure. Monitor renal function. (5.6) Embryo-fetal toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise males and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3) 5.1 Delayed Myelosuppression Lomustine Capsules cause myelosuppression that can result in fatal infections and bleeding. Myelosuppression from Lomustine Capsules is delayed, dose-related, and cumulative. It usually occurs 4 to 6 weeks after drug administration and persists for 1 to 2 weeks. Thrombocytopenia is generally more severe than leukopenia. Cumulative myelosuppression from Lomustine Capsules is manifested by greater severity and longer duration of cytopenias. Monitor blood counts for at least 6 weeks after each dose. Do not give Lomustine Capsules more frequently than every 6 weeks. Adjust dose based on nadir blood counts from prior dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.2 Risk of Overdosage Fatal toxicity occurs with overdosage of Lomustine Capsules. Dispensing or administering more than one dose can lead to fatal toxicity. Prescribe only one dose at a time. Dispense only enough capsules for one dose. Both physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that only one dose of Lomustine Capsules is taken every 6 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Overdosage (10) ]. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity Pulmonary toxicity characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis occurs with Lomustine Capsules. Patients with a baseline below 70% of the predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) or Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DL CO ) are at increased risk. The onset of pulmonary toxicity occurs after an interval of 6 months or longer from the start of therapy, with cumulative doses of Lomustine Capsules usually greater than 1100 mg/m 2 . Obtain baseline pulmonary function tests prior to initiating treatment and repeat frequently during treatment. Permanently discontinue Lomustine Capsules in patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. 5.4 Secondary Malignancies Secondary malignancies, including acute leukemia and myelodysplasia, occur with long term use. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic toxicity, manifested by increased levels of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin occurs with Lomustine Capsules. Monitor liver function. 5.6 Nephrotoxicity Progressive renal failure with a decrease in kidney size occurs with Lomustine Capsules. Monitor renal function. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, Lomustine Capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Embryo-fetal toxicity and teratogenicity occurred in rats and rabbits receiving lomustine daily during organogenesis at doses approximately two to four times the total human dose of 130 mg/m 2 over 6 weeks (0.18 to 0.27 times the single human dose of 130 mg/m 2 ) based on body surface area (BSA). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lomustine Capsules and for 2 weeks after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lomustine Capsules and for 3.5 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ].",

(8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, Lomustine Capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. There are no available data on Lomustine Capsules exposure in pregnant women. Lomustine was teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at total dose levels approximately two to four times the total human dose of 130 mg/m 2 over 6 weeks (0.18 to 0.27 times the single human dose of 130 mg/m 2 ) based on BSA [see Data] . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Lomustine was administered by intraperitoneal injection daily to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at dose levels of 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg. Resorption rates and post-implantation loss occurred at doses greater than or equal to 4 mg/kg (approximately 0.18 times the clinical dose of 130 mg/m 2 based on BSA or approximately twice the total clinical dose of lomustine over 6 weeks). Malformations (omphalocele, ectopia cordis, scoliosis, syndactyly, hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, anophthalmia, anomalies of aortic arch, dextrocardia, malpositioning of the ovaries and testes, sternoschisis, and shortened/misshapen bone of the fore or hind limbs) and decreased fetal body weight occurred at all dose levels. In pregnant rabbits treated with lomustine at 3 mg/kg (approximately 0.27 times the 130 mg/m 2 clinical dose based on BSA or approximately four times the total clinical dose of lomustine over 6 weeks) during organogenesis, there were increases in abortions and decreases in surviving pup weight that persisted postnatally. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of lomustine or its metabolites in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant, or its effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from Lomustine Capsules, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Lomustine Capsules and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, Lomustine Capsules can cause fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the final dose. Males Based on Lomustine Capsules's mechanism of action, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lomustine Capsules and for 3.5 months after the final dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Infertility Based on animal findings and its mechanism of action, Lomustine Capsules may result in reduced fertility in males and females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Pediatric use, including dose, is not based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies. 8.5 Geriatric Use No data in the clinical studies of Lomustine Capsules are available for patients 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Lomustine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Lomustine alkylates DNA and RNA. As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of lomustine are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Lomustine crosses the blood-brain barrier. Elimination The serum half-life of lomustine metabolites ranges from 16 hours to 48 hours. Metabolism Metabolic pathways involved in the elimination of lomustine have not been characterized. Excretion Following oral administration of radioactive lomustine at doses ranging from 30 mg/m 2 to 100 mg/m 2 , approximately half of the radioactivity administered was excreted in the urine in the form of degradation products within 24 hours. Specific Populations The impact of patient specific (e.g., age, sex, and race) or disease (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) characteristics on the pharmacokinetics of lomustine is unknown."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Lomustine is carcinogenic in rats and mice, producing a marked increase in tumor incidence in doses lower than those employed clinically. In female rats, daily intraperitoneal treatment with lomustine for 2 weeks prior to mating with untreated males resulted in dose dependent decreases in number of corpora lutea and resorption rates with no live births at a dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 0.14 times the recommended clinical dose of 130 mg/m 2 based on body surface area (BSA), or approximately twice the total clinical dose of lomustine over 6 weeks) and decreased pup survival during the first 4 postnatal days at doses greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/kg (a daily dose of approximately 0.06 times the recommended clinical dose of 130 mg/m 2 based on BSA or approximately equal to the total clinical dose of lomustine over 6 weeks). Lomustine Capsules may also result in decreased male fertility. Intraperitoneal injection of lomustine resulted in decreased fertility in male rats mated to untreated females based on decreased implantations and decreased fetal body weight at weekly doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.23 times the single clinical dose of 130 mg/m 2 based on BSA, or approximately equal to the total clinical dose of lomustine over 6 weeks), and increased resorptions at doses greater than or equal to 2.5 mg/kg/week."
