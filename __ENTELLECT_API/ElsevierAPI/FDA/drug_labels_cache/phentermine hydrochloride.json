      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches \u00d7 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine hydrochloride tablets, [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 , 12.2) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. (2.1) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). (2.1) Phentermine hydrochloride tablets can be taken with or without food. (2.1) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) (2.2) 2.1 Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride are 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients must be informed that phentermine hydrochloride is a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity, and that coadministration of phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended [see Indications and Usage (1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients must be instructed on how much phentermine to take, and when and how to take it [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Advise pregnant women and nursing mothers not to use phentermine (see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. Patients must be informed about the risks of use of phentermine (including the risks discussed in Warnings and Precautions), about the symptoms of potential adverse reactions and when to contact a physician and/or take other action. The risks include, but are not limited to: Development of primary pulmonary hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Development of serious valvular heart disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Effects on the ability to engage in potentially hazardous tasks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The risk of an increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] The risk of interactions [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.9 ) and Drug Interactions (7) ] See also, for example, Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8) . The patients must also be informed about the potential for developing tolerance and actions if they suspect development of tolerance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] and the risk of dependence and the potential consequences of abuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) , and Overdosage (10) ]. Tell patients to keep phentermine in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Selling or giving away phentermine may harm others and is against the law.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine Hydrochloride Capsules USP, 37.5 mg are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u226530 kg/m 2 , or \u226527 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42 % respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. ( 2.1 ) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). ( 2.1 ) Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets can be taken with or without food. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 37.5 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. () 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 15 mg and 30 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 37.5 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. ( 2.1 ) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). ( 2.1 ) Phentermine Hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) or one capsule (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half-tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late Evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairments (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 37.5 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. ( 2.1 ) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). ( 2.1 ) Phentermine Hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) or one capsule (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half-tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late Evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairments (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required.",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Use of Phentermine is contraindicated during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. 7.2 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 7.3 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Medications Requirements may be altered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ]. 7.4 Adrenergic Neuron Blocking Drugs Phentermine may decrease the hypotensive effect of adrenergic neuron blocking drugs.",
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering Phentermine to patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ].",
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia.",
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed with phentermine to determine the potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.",
      "17 PATIENT COUNCELING INFORMATION Patients must be informed that Phentermine Hydrochloride is a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity, and that co-administration of Phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Patients must be instructed on how much Phentermine to take, and when and how to take it [ see Dosage and Administration ( 3 ) ]. Advice pregnant women and nursing mothers not to use Phentermine [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ]. Patients must be informed about the risks of use of Phentermine (including the risks discussed in Warnings and Precautions), about the symptoms of potential adverse reactions and when to contact a physician and/or take other action.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. The literature reported cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions is 62% to 85%. Exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However, in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] ."

Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single- dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

(2.1) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 )- ( 2.2 ) 2.1Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single- dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride tablets USP are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering Phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of Phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy categoryX Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

(2.1) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 )- ( 2.2 ) 2.1Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single- dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy categoryX Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ].

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. () 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy categoryX Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] ."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. (2.1) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). (2.1) Phentermine hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. (2.1) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 )- ( 2.2 ) 2.1Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 37.5 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. ( 2.1 ) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). ( 2.1 ) Phentermine Hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) or one capsule (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half-tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late Evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairments (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches \u00d7 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine hydrochloride tablets, [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 , 12.2) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

(2.1) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 )- ( 2.2 ) 2.1Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single- dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction.

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG.

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused.

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches \u00d7 0.0254 = meters.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches \u00d7 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine hydrochloride tablets, [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 , 12.2) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride tablets USP are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. The literature reported cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions is 62% to 85%. Exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended.5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone.5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued.5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)and OVERDOSAGE (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage.5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure).5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Use caution when administering Phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2), limit the dosage of Phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

    "overdosage": [
      "The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.3)."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 37.5 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of Phentermine, Phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg Phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg Phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of Phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, Phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

(8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dllamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9) and OVERDOSAGE (10). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy categoryX Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

      "9.1 Controlled Substance Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

    "overdosage": [
      "The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.3)."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d / l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours.

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "Phentermine hydrochloride, USP 37.5 mg is indicated as short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2, or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BMI Index The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1, 12.2) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2.1 Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) or one capsule (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half-tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late Evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairments (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9) and Overdosage ( 10). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Use of phentermine is contraindicated during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. 7.2 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 7.3 Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Medications Requirements may be altered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9)]. 7.4 Adrenergic Neuron Blocking Drugs Phentermine may decrease the hypotensive effect of adrenergic neuron blocking drugs."
    ],
    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

    "overdosage": [
      "The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3) ."

      "DESCRIPTION Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic. Its chemical name is \u03b1, \u03b1, -dimethylphenethylamine hydrochloride. The structural formula is as follows: Phentermine hydrochloride is a white, odorless, hygroscopic, crystalline powder which is soluble in water and lower alcohols, slightly soluble in chloroform and insoluble in ether. Each 8 mg contains Phentermine Hydrochloride, USP, and inactive ingredients include hydrogenated vegetable oil, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. \"Image Description\""

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. Pharmacokinetics Specific Populations Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. The literature reported cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions is 62%-85%. Exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use 62%-85%. Exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment."
    ],
    "clinical_studies": [
      "CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity in patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m , or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Adverse Reactions / Drug Abuse and Dependence and Overdosage . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Patients must be informed that phentermine hydrochloride is a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity, and that coadministration of phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (see Indications and Usage and Warnings ). Patients must be instructed on how much phentermine to take, and when and how to take it (see Dosage and Administration ). Advise pregnant women and nursing mothers not to use phentermine (see Precautions ). Patients must be informed about the risks of use of phentermine (including the risks discussed in Warnings and Precautions ), about the symptoms of potential adverse reactions and when to contact a physician and/or take other action. The risks include, but are not limited to: Development of primary pulmonary hypertension (see Warnings ) Development of serious valvular heart disease (see Warnings ) Effects on the ability to engage in potentially hazardous tasks (see Warnings ) The risk of an increase in blood pressure (see Warnings and Adverse Reactions ) The risk of interactions (see Contraindications , Warnings , and Precautions / Drug Interactions ) The patients must also be informed about the potential for developing tolerance and actions if they suspect development of tolerance (see Warnings ) and the risk of dependence and the potential consequences of abuse (see Warnings , Drug Abuse and Dependence , and Overdosage ). Tell patients to keep phentermine in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Selling or giving away phentermine may harm others and is against the law. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Use of phentermine is contraindicated during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Medications Requirements may be altered (see Warnings ) Adrenergic Neuron Blocking Drugs Phentermine may decrease the hypotensive effect of adrenergic neuron blocking drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed with phentermine to determine the potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) (see Clinical Pharmacology ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment (see Clinical Pharmacology )."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ."

Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u226416 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. () 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy categoryX Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u226530 kg/m 2 , or \u226527 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches \u00d7 0.0254 = meters.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

(2.1) Late evening administration should be avoided (risk of insomnia). (2.1) Phentermine hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. (2.1) Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 )- ( 2.2 ) 2.1Exogenous Obesity Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia. 2.2 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning and usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single- dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 \u200b Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ].

Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed with phentermine to determine the potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet.

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ). Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ). Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP and any other drug products for weight loss, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d-and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine hydrochloride tablets, USP for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute Overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3 ) ."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [See Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )].

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62%-85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 ) ] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A Reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mother: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times that recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) \u2022 A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 4 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Phentermine hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phentermine hydrochloride Tablets are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient's height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches \u00d7 0.0254 = meters.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \"anorectics\" or \"anorexigenics.\" It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (Cmax) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% to 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \"anorectic\" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine C max and AUC increase 13% and 42%, respectively."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing Phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if Phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of Phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Use caution when administering phentermine hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine hydrochloride to 15 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below. Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , or \u2265 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. 9.3 Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes.

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as \u201canorectics\u201d or \u201canorexigenics.\u201d It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Typical of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of phentermine, phentermine reaches peak concentrations (C max ) after 3 to 4.4 hours. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions was 62% - 85%. Systemic exposure of phentermine may increase up to 91%, 45%, and 22% in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 )]. Drug Interactions In a single-dose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m 2 The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [se e CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 , 12.2 )] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-administration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). ( 5.1 ) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. ( 5.2 ) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. ( 5.3 ) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. ( 5.4 ) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. ( 5.5 ) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. ( 5.7 ) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). ( 5.8 ) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Co-administration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride capsules are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, co-administration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l lamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ). The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required. 5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Phentermine hydrochloride capsule, 15 mg contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general populations is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 4 , 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric use: Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Avoid use in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and d l l-amphetamine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.1 )]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m 2 , including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations."

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine \u00ae , CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( 9.3 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with \u201canorectic\u201d drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited."

      "WARNINGS Coadministration with Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued. Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Adverse Reactions/Drug Abuse and Dependence and Overdosage . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Usage with Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. Use in Patients with Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Patients must be informed that phentermine hydrochloride is a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity, and that coadministration of phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (see Indications and Usage and Warnings). Patients must be instructed on how much phentermine to take, and when and how to take it (see Dosage and Administration). Advise pregnant women and nursing mothers not to use phentermine (see Precautions). Patients must be informed about the risks of use of phentermine (including the risks discussed in Warnings and Precautions), about the symptoms of potential adverse reactions and when to contact a physician and/or take other action. The risks include, but are not limited to: \u2022 Development of primary pulmonary hypertension (see Warnings) \u2022 Development of serious valvular heart disease (see Warnings) \u2022 Effects on the ability to engage in potentially hazardous tasks (see Warnings) \u2022 The risk of an increase in blood pressure (see Warnings and Adverse Reactions) \u2022 The risk of interactions (see Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions/Drug Interactions) The patients must also be informed about \u2022 the potential for developing tolerance and actions if they suspect development of tolerance (see Warnings) and \u2022 the risk of dependence and the potential consequences of abuse (see Warnings, Drug Abuse and Dependence, and Overdosage). Tell patients to keep phentermine in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Selling or giving away phentermine may harm others and is against the law. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Use of phentermine is contraindicated during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Medications Requirements may be altered (see Warnings) Adrenergic Neuron Blocking Drugs Phentermine may decrease the hypotensive effect of adrenergic neuron blocking drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed with phentermine to determine the potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) (see Clinical Pharmacology ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended. Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment (see Clinical Pharmacology) ."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance. Abuse Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. Dependence Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine\u00ae, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. The usual adult dose is one tablet three times a day \u00bd hour before meals. This tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose. Phentermine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than or equal to 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia."
