      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely ( 5.1 ). Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( 5.2 ). Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 100 mg and 25 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue ISENTRESS and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping ISENTRESS treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. 5.2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ISENTRESS. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.3 Phenylketonurics ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.05 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.10 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity (\u22652%) are insomnia, headache, dizziness, nausea and fatigue ( 6.1 ). Creatine kinase elevations were observed in subjects who received ISENTRESS. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Treatment-Na\u00efve Adults The following safety assessment of ISENTRESS in treatment-na\u00efve subjects is based on the randomized double-blind active controlled study of treatment-na\u00efve subjects, STARTMRK (Protocol 021) with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with a fixed dose of emtricitabine 200 mg (+) tenofovir 300 mg, (N=281) versus efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg at bedtime in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir, (N=282). During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir was 1104 patient-years and 1036 patient-years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir. In Protocol 021, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 5% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir and 10% in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir. The clinical adverse drug reactions (ADRs) listed below were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir or efavirenz + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir. Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of treatment-na\u00efve subjects treated with ISENTRESS are presented in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Drug Reactions Includes adverse experiences considered by investigators to be at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe Intensity Intensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

The analysis is based on all available data. If subjects initiated or increased serum lipid-reducing agents, the last available lipid values prior to the change in therapy were used in the analysis. If the missing data was due to other reasons, subjects were censored thereafter for the analysis. At baseline, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 5% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 3% in the efavirenz group. Through Week 240, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 9% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 15% in the efavirenz group.

A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT. The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo. The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient-years versus 244 patient-years on placebo. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5% in subjects receiving placebo. Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT. Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 6.

These events have been included because of their seriousness, increased frequency on ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz or placebo, or investigator's assessment of potential causal relationship. Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations: genital herpes, herpes zoster Psychiatric Disorders: depression (particularly in subjects with a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and behaviors Renal and Urinary Disorders: nephrolithiasis, renal failure Selected Adverse Events - Adults Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-na\u00efve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm 3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator. Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS (see Table 7 ). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. Patients with Co-existing Conditions - Adults Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, treatment-experienced subjects (N = 114/699 or 16%) and treatment-na\u00efve subjects (N = 34/563 or 6%) with chronic (but not acute) active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection for all treatment groups. At 96 weeks, in treatment-experienced subjects, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29%, 34% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11%, 10% and 9% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 240 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22%, 44% and 17%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 13%, 13% and 5% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. Pediatrics 2 to 18 Years of Age ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS. In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash. One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious. 4 Weeks to less than 2 Years of Age ISENTRESS has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug-related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug-related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) in patients with underlying liver disease and/or concomitant medications Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: cerebellar ataxia Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, paranoia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of ISENTRESS and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy ( 7 ). Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir ( 2.1 , 7.2 ). 7.1 Effect of Raltegravir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents Raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A in vitro . Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. A midazolam drug interaction study confirmed the low propensity of raltegravir to alter the pharmacokinetics of agents metabolized by CYP3A4 in vivo by demonstrating a lack of effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, ISENTRESS is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein (e.g., protease inhibitors, NNRTIs, opioid analgesics, statins, azole antifungals, proton pump inhibitors and anti-erectile dysfunction agents). 7.2 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway. Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir and coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that induce UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may reduce plasma levels of raltegravir. The impact of other inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 8 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 8: Selected Drug Interactions in Adults Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Raltegravir Clinical Comment Metal-Containing Antacids aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids \u2193 Coadministration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and ISENTRESS is not recommended. Other Agents rifampin \u2193 The recommended dosage of ISENTRESS is 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 7.3 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with ISENTRESS In drug interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following: hormonal contraceptives, methadone, lamivudine, tenofovir, etravirine, darunavir/ritonavir, or boceprevir. Moreover, atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, calcium carbonate antacids, darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, etravirine, omeprazole, or tipranavir/ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. No dose adjustment is required when ISENTRESS is coadministered with these drugs."

Developmental toxicity studies were performed in rabbits (at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day) and rats (at oral doses up to 600 mg/kg/day). The reproductive toxicity study in rats was performed with pre-, peri-, and postnatal evaluation. The highest doses in these studies produced systemic exposures in these species approximately 3- to 4-fold the exposure at the recommended human dose. In both rabbits and rats, no treatment-related effects on embryonic/fetal survival or fetal weights were observed. In addition, no treatment-related external, visceral, or skeletal changes were observed in rabbits. However, treatment-related increases over controls in the incidence of supernumerary ribs were seen in rats at 600 mg/kg/day (exposures 3-fold the exposure at the recommended human dose). Placenta transfer of drug was demonstrated in both rats and rabbits. At a maternal dose of 600 mg/kg/day in rats, mean drug concentrations in fetal plasma were approximately 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater than in maternal plasma at 1 hour and 24 hours postdose, respectively. Mean drug concentrations in fetal plasma were approximately 2% of the mean maternal concentration at both 1 and 24 hours postdose at a maternal dose of 1000 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant patients exposed to ISENTRESS, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking ISENTRESS. In addition, it is recommended that HIV-1-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. It is not known whether raltegravir is secreted in human milk. However, raltegravir is secreted in the milk of lactating rats. Mean drug concentrations in milk were approximately 3-fold greater than those in maternal plasma at a maternal dose of 600 mg/kg/day in rats. There were no effects in rat offspring attributable to exposure of ISENTRESS through the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of ISENTRESS were evaluated in HIV-1 infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial, IMPAACT P1066 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . See Dosage and Administration (2.3) for dosing recommendations for children 4 weeks of age and older. The safety and dosing information for ISENTRESS have not been established in infants less than 4 weeks of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects were observed. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects were observed. No dosage adjustment is necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV-1 antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1.66 log 10 copies/mL by Day 10. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial, Protocol 005, and Protocols 018 and 019, antiviral responses were similar among subjects regardless of dose. Effects on Electrocardiogram In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 31 healthy subjects were administered a single oral supratherapeutic dose of raltegravir 1600 mg and placebo. Peak raltegravir plasma concentrations were approximately 4-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 400 mg dose. ISENTRESS did not appear to prolong the QTc interval for 12 hours postdose. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change was -0.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper Cl: 3.1 msec). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir (film-coated tablet) is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state. Raltegravir AUC and C max increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. Raltegravir C 12hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and C max . The average accumulation ratio for C 12hr ranged from approximately 1.2 to 1.6. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. In subjects who received 400 mg twice daily alone, raltegravir drug exposures were characterized by a geometric mean AUC 0-12hr of 14.3 \u00b5M\u2219hr and C 12hr of 142 nM. Considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed C 12hr in Protocols 018 and 019, the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212% and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122%. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption ISENTRESS may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-1-infected patients. The effect of consumption of low-, moderate- and high-fat meals on steady-state raltegravir pharmacokinetics was assessed in healthy volunteers administered the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal (600 Kcal, 21 g fat) did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13% relative to fasting. Raltegravir C 12hr was 66% higher and C max was 5% higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal (825 Kcal, 52 g fat) increased AUC and C max by approximately 2-fold and increased C 12hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal (300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat) decreased AUC and C max by 46% and 52%, respectively; C 12hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6% decrease in AUC, 62% decrease in C max , and 188% increase in C 12hr compared to administration in the fasted state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. The effect of food on the formulation for oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. Special Populations Pediatric Two pediatric formulations were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers, where the chewable tablet and oral suspension were compared to the 400 mg tablet. The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 9, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

Age The effect of age (18 years and older) on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was evaluated in the composite analysis. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Race The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in adults was evaluated in the composite analysis. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Gender A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in healthy adult males and females. Additionally, the effect of gender was evaluated in a composite analysis of pharmacokinetic data from 103 healthy subjects and 28 HIV-1 infected subjects receiving raltegravir monotherapy with fasted administration. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Additionally, hepatic impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis. There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult subjects with severe renal impairment. Additionally, renal impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis. There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided. UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09).

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). Additive to synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir-treatment failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1.66 log 10 copies/mL by Day 10. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial, Protocol 005, and Protocols 018 and 019, antiviral responses were similar among subjects regardless of dose. Effects on Electrocardiogram In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 31 healthy subjects were administered a single oral supratherapeutic dose of raltegravir 1600 mg and placebo. Peak raltegravir plasma concentrations were approximately 4-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 400 mg dose. ISENTRESS did not appear to prolong the QTc interval for 12 hours postdose. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change was -0.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper Cl: 3.1 msec)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir (film-coated tablet) is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state. Raltegravir AUC and C max increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. Raltegravir C 12hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and C max . The average accumulation ratio for C 12hr ranged from approximately 1.2 to 1.6. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. In subjects who received 400 mg twice daily alone, raltegravir drug exposures were characterized by a geometric mean AUC 0-12hr of 14.3 \u00b5M\u2219hr and C 12hr of 142 nM. Considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed C 12hr in Protocols 018 and 019, the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212% and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122%. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption ISENTRESS may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-1-infected patients. The effect of consumption of low-, moderate- and high-fat meals on steady-state raltegravir pharmacokinetics was assessed in healthy volunteers administered the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal (600 Kcal, 21 g fat) did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13% relative to fasting. Raltegravir C 12hr was 66% higher and C max was 5% higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal (825 Kcal, 52 g fat) increased AUC and C max by approximately 2-fold and increased C 12hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal (300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat) decreased AUC and C max by 46% and 52%, respectively; C 12hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6% decrease in AUC, 62% decrease in C max , and 188% increase in C 12hr compared to administration in the fasted state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. The effect of food on the formulation for oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. Special Populations Pediatric Two pediatric formulations were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers, where the chewable tablet and oral suspension were compared to the 400 mg tablet. The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 9, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

Age The effect of age (18 years and older) on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was evaluated in the composite analysis. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Race The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in adults was evaluated in the composite analysis. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Gender A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in healthy adult males and females. Additionally, the effect of gender was evaluated in a composite analysis of pharmacokinetic data from 103 healthy subjects and 28 HIV-1 infected subjects receiving raltegravir monotherapy with fasted administration. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Additionally, hepatic impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis. There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult subjects with severe renal impairment. Additionally, renal impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis. There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided. UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09).

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). Additive to synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir-treatment failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir."

At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was 1.8-fold (females) or 1.2-fold (males) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. Treatment-related squamous cell carcinoma of nose/nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg/kg/day raltegravir for 104 weeks. These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and/or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during dosing. No tumors of the nose/nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (males) and 50 mg/kg/day (females) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1.7-fold (males) to 1.4-fold (females) greater than the AUC (54 \u03bcM\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage, and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies. No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in a 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose."

Randomization was stratified by degree of resistance to PI (1PI vs. >1PI) and the use of enfuvirtide in the OBT. Prior to randomization, OBT was selected by the investigator based on genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing and prior ART history.

The primary virology endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL at Week 24 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -12% for each study; and the frequency of adverse events up to 24 weeks. Subjects with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they each failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of switching to ISENTRESS versus continuing on lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In the combined analysis of these studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 82.3% of the ISENTRESS group versus 90.3% of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group. Clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment groups. 14.3 Pediatric Subjects 2 to 18 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Subjects were stratified by age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Subjects were enrolled into cohorts according to age and received the following formulations: Cohort I (12 to less than 18 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIa (6 to less than 12 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIb (6 to less than 12 years old), chewable tablet; Cohort III (2 to less than 6 years), chewable tablet. Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen. The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional subjects were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 subjects, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . These 96 subjects had a median age of 13 (range 2 to 18) years, were 51% Female, 34% Caucasian, and 59% Black. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log 10 copies/mL, median CD4 cell count was 481 cells/mm 3 (range: 0 \u2013 2361) and median CD4% was 23.3% (range: 0 \u2013 44). Overall, 8% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and 59% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. Most subjects had previously used at least one NNRTI (78%) or one PI (83%). Ninety-three (97%) subjects 2 to 18 years of age completed 24 weeks of treatment (3 discontinued due to non-compliance). At Week 24, 54% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL; 66% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 119 cells/mm 3 (3.8%). 4 Weeks to Less Than 2 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age (Cohorts IV and V) who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as an oral suspension without regard to food in combination with an optimized background regimen. The 26 subjects had a median age of 28 weeks (range: 4 -100), were 35% female, 85% Black and 8% Caucasian. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.7 log 10 copies/mL (range: 3.1 \u2013 7), median CD4 cell count was 1400 cells/mm 3 (range: 131 \u2013 3648) and median CD4% was 18.6% (range: 3.3 \u2013 39.3). Overall, 69% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA exceeding 100,000 copies/mL and 23% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. None of the 26 patients were completely treatment na\u00efve. All infants under 6 months of age had received nevirapine or zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-infant transmission, and 43% of patients greater than 6 months of age had received two or more antiretrovirals. Of the 26 treated subjects, 23 subjects were included in the Week 24 and 48 efficacy analyses, respectively. All 26 treated subjects were included for safety analyses. At Week 24, 39% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 500 cells/mm 3 (7.5%). At Week 48, 44% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 492 cells/mm 3 (7.8%)."

General Information Instruct patients to reread patient labeling each time the prescription is renewed. Patients should remain under the care of a physician when using ISENTRESS. Instruct patients to inform their physician or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens. ISENTRESS is not a cure for HIV-1 infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV-1 infection such as opportunistic infections. Tell patients that sustained decreases in plasma HIV RNA have been associated with a reduced risk of progression to AIDS and death. Patients should remain on continuous HIV therapy to control HIV infection and decrease HIV-related illnesses. Advise patients to avoid doing things that can spread HIV-1 infection to others. Do not share needles or other injection equipment. Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades. Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Do not breastfeed. Mothers with HIV-1 should not breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk. Also, it is unknown if ISENTRESS can be passed to the baby through breast milk and whether it could harm the baby. General Dosing Instructions Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of ISENTRESS, they should take it as soon as they remember. If they do not remember until it is time for the next dose, instruct them to skip the missed dose and go back to the regular schedule.

      "Instructions for Use ISENTRESS \u00ae (eye sen tris) (raltegravir) for oral suspension Read this Instructions for Use before you mix and give a dose of ISENTRESS for oral suspension to your child for the first time, and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. These instructions will help you to correctly mix and give a dose of ISENTRESS for oral suspension to your child. See the Patient Information leaflet that comes with ISENTRESS for oral suspension for more information about ISENTRESS. Your doctor will decide the right dose based on your child's weight. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to mix or give ISENTRESS for oral suspension to your child. Each ISENTRESS for oral suspension kit contains the following supplies (see Figure A ): 2 reusable mixing cups with attached lids 2 reusable 5 mL dosing syringes 60 foil packets containing ISENTRESS for oral suspension For each dose of ISENTRESS for oral suspension you will need the following: 1 mixing cup with attached lid 1 dosing syringe (5mL) 1 foil packet containing the medicine Drinking water (not included in kit) How do I prepare a dose of ISENTRESS for oral suspension? Step 1. Fill mixing cup about half-way with drinking water (see Figure B ). Step 2. Fill the dosing syringe. Start with the plunger pushed all the way inside the barrel of the syringe. Insert the tip of the syringe into the water and pull back on the plunger to the 5 mL marking on the barrel of the syringe (see Figure C ). Step 3. Pour out remaining water from mixing cup (see Figure D ). Step 4. Add the 5 mL of water from the dosing syringe back into the mixing cup by pressing down on the plunger (see Figure E ). Step 5. Open 1 foil packet. There is a notch that you can use to tear open the foil packet, or you may use scissors to cut along the dotted line. Pour entire contents into mixing cup (see Figure F ). Step 6. Close the attached lid to seal the mixing cup (see Figure G ). It will snap shut. Step 7. Swirl the mixing cup to mix using a gentle circular motion for 30-60 seconds (see Figure H ). Do not turn the mixing cup upside down. The liquid will be cloudy. Step 8. Open the mixing cup. Put the tip of the syringe into the liquid and pull back the plunger to the mL marking that matches your child's prescribed dose (see Figure I ). Your child's dose may be different from the one shown in the figure. How should I give a dose of ISENTRESS for oral suspension? Step 9. Place the tip of the dosing syringe in your child's mouth and turn it toward either cheek. Gently push down on the plunger to give the medicine (see Figure J ). Give the dose of ISENTRESS oral suspension to your child within 30 minutes of mixing. If you are not able to give your child's dose within 30 minutes of mixing, pour the unused medicine into the trash. You will need to mix a new dose. How should I dispose of leftover ISENTRESS for oral suspension? Step 10. Pour any leftover medicine from the mixing cup into the trash (see Figure K ). Step 11. Remove plunger from the barrel of the dosing syringe. Hand wash the dosing syringe and mixing cup with warm water and dish soap. Rinse with water and air dry (see Figure L ). How should I store ISENTRESS for oral suspension? Store ISENTRESS for oral suspension at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Store in the original container.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD can be administered with or without food ( 2.1 ). Do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg or 600 mg film-coated tablet. See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension ( 2.1 ). Adults Treatment-na\u00efve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily: 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) film-coated tablet orally, once daily or 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily ( 2.2 ). Treatment-experienced patients: 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily ( 2.2 ). During coadministration with rifampin in adults, 800 mg (2 \u00d7 400 mg) twice daily ( 2.2 ). Pediatrics If weighing at least 40 kg, and either treatment-na\u00efve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily: 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) film-coated tablet orally, once daily or 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily or 300 mg (3 \u00d7 100 mg) chewable tablets, twice daily ( 2.3 ). If weighing at least 25 kg: One 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily. If unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet, as specified in Table 2 ( 2.3 ). If weighing at least 3 kg to less than 25 kg: Weight-based dosing using the chewable tablet or oral suspension, as specified in Table 4 ( 2.3 ). For neonates (birth to 4 weeks [28 days] of age): Weight-based dosing of the oral suspension as specified in Table 5 ( 2.3 ). 2.1 General Dosing Recommendations Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles, do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg film-coated tablet or the ISENTRESS HD 600 mg film-coated tablet. See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension. Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . ISENTRESS film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole. ISENTRESS chewable tablets may be chewed or swallowed whole. Maximum daily dose is 300 mg taken by mouth twice daily. For children who have difficulty chewing the 25 mg chewable tablet, the tablet may be crushed. Preparation of the crushed 25 mg chewable tablet: Place the tablet(s) in a small, clean cup. For each tablet, add a teaspoonful (~5 mL) of liquid (for example, water, juice, or breast milk). Within 2 minutes, the tablet(s) will absorb the liquid and fall apart. Using a spoon, crush any remaining pieces of the tablet(s). Immediately administer the entire dose orally. If any portion of the dose is left in the cup, add another teaspoonful (~5 mL) of liquid, swirl and administer immediately. ISENTRESS for oral suspension: See Instructions for Use for details on preparation and administration of ISENTRESS for oral suspension. Using the provided mixing cup, combine 10 mL of water and the entire contents of one packet of ISENTRESS for oral suspension and mix. Each single-use packet for oral suspension contains 100 mg of raltegravir which is suspended in 10 mL of water giving a final concentration of 10 mg per mL. Maximum daily dose is 100 mg taken by mouth twice daily. Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder into a uniform suspension. Do not shake. Once mixed, measure the prescribed dose volume of suspension with a syringe and administer the dose orally. The dose should be administered orally within 30 minutes of mixing. Discard any remaining suspension into the trash. 2.2 Adults The recommended adult dosage of ISENTRESS film-coated tablets is displayed in Table 1. ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD should be taken by mouth and may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely ( 5.1 ). Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( 5.2 ). Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 100 mg and 25 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. 5.2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ISENTRESS. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.3 Phenylketonurics ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.05 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.10 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity (\u22652%) are insomnia, headache, dizziness, nausea and fatigue ( 6.1 ). Creatine kinase elevations were observed in subjects who received ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Treatment-Na\u00efve Adults The safety of ISENTRESS was evaluated in HIV-infected treatment-na\u00efve subjects in 2 Phase III studies: STARTMRK evaluated ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily versus efavirenz, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and ONCEMRK evaluated ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily versus ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Safety data from these two studies are presented side-by-side in Tables 6 and 7 to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up and study design. STARTMRK (ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily) In STARTMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (N=281) or efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg at bedtime (N=282) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, (N=282). During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was 1104 patient-years and 1036 patient-years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In STARTMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 240 was 5% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 10% in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. ONCEMRK (ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [2 \u00d7 600 mg] once daily) In ONCEMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily (n=531) or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (n=266) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily was 913 patient-years and for ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily was 450 patient-years. In ONCEMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 96 was 1% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily and 2% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of treatment-na\u00efve subjects treated with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz in STARTMRK through Week 240 or ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in ONCEMRK through Week 96 are presented in Table 6. In STARTMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in \u22652% of subjects on ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 240 also include diarrhea, flatulence, asthenia, decreased appetite, abnormal dreams, depression and nightmare. In ONCEMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in \u22652% of subjects on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 96 also include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite.

If the missing data was due to other reasons, subjects were censored thereafter for the analysis. At baseline, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 5% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 3% in the efavirenz group. Through Week 240, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 9% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 15% in the efavirenz group.

A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT. The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo. The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient-years versus 244 patient-years on placebo. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5% in subjects receiving placebo. Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT. Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Adverse Drug Reactions Includes adverse reactions at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe Intensity Intensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

These events have been included because of their seriousness, increased frequency compared with efavirenz or placebo, or investigator's assessment of potential causal relationship. Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations: genital herpes, herpes zoster Psychiatric Disorders: depression (particularly in subjects with a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and behaviors Renal and Urinary Disorders: nephrolithiasis, renal failure Selected Adverse Events - Adults In studies of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-na\u00efve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm 3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator. Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD (see Tables 6 and 8 ). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. Patients with Co-existing Conditions - Adults Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In Phase III studies of ISENTRESS, patients with chronic (but not acute) active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the treatment-experienced studies, BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, 16% of all patients (114/699) were co-infected; in the treatment-na\u00efve studies, STARTMRK and ONCEMRK, 6% (34/563) and 3% (23/797), respectively, were co-infected. In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection for all treatment groups. At 96 weeks, in treatment-experienced subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29%, 34% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11%, 10% and 9% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 240 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22%, 44% and 17%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 13%, 13% and 5% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 96 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27%, 40% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily as compared to 7%, 5% and 3% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily. Pediatrics 2 to 18 Years of Age ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS. In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash. One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious. 4 Weeks to Less than 2 Years of Age ISENTRESS has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation. HIV-1 Exposed Neonates Forty-two neonates were treated with ISENTRESS for up to 6 weeks from birth, and followed for a total of 24 weeks in IMPAACT P1110 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. There were no drug related clinical adverse reactions and three drug related laboratory adverse reactions (one case of transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine-containing regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). The safety profile in neonates was generally similar to that observed in older patients treated with ISENTRESS. No clinically meaningful differences in the adverse event profile of neonates were observed when compared to adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) in patients with underlying liver disease and/or concomitant medications Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: cerebellar ataxia Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, paranoia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy ( 7 ). Coadministration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir ( 2.1 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway. Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir and coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that induce UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may reduce plasma levels of raltegravir (see Table 11 ). Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 11 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In some cases, recommendations differ for ISENTRESS versus ISENTRESS HD. Table 11: Selected Drug Interactions in Adults Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Raltegravir Clinical Comment for ISENTRESS Clinical Comment for ISENTRESS HD Metal-Containing Antacids Aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids \u2193 Coadministration or staggered administration is not recommended. Calcium carbonate antacid \u2193 No dose adjustment Co-administration is not recommended Other Agents Rifampin \u2193 The recommended dosage is 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Coadministration is not recommended. Tipranavir/ritonavir No dose adjustment Coadministration is not recommended Etravirine \u2193 No dose adjustment Coadministration is not recommended. Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes not mentioned above e.g., Carbamazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin \u2193\u2194 The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown. Coadministration is not recommended. 7.2 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS In drug interaction studies performed using ISENTRESS film-coated tablets 400 mg twice daily dose, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, methadone, midazolam, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, etravirine, darunavir/ritonavir, or boceprevir. Moreover, atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, calcium carbonate antacids, darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, etravirine, omeprazole, or tipranavir/ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg twice daily raltegravir. No dose adjustment is required when ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily is coadministered with these drugs. There is no predicted pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ISENTRESS and tenofovir alafenamide. ISENTRESS HD In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. No dose adjustment is recommended when ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily is coadministered with atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, darunavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, efavirenz and omeprazole. There is no predicted pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ISENTRESS HD and tenofovir alafenamide."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no difference in the rate of overall birth defects for raltegravir compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) (see Data ) . The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15-20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at <20 weeks gestation (see Data ) . In animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with oral administration of raltegravir during organogenesis at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1200 mg (see Data ) . Data Human Data Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 850 exposures to raltegravir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 450 exposures in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for raltegravir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 1.7% to 5.1%) following first trimester exposure to raltegravir-containing regimens and 3.7% (95% CI: 2.1% to 6.0%) following second and third trimester exposure to raltegravir-containing regimens. There are limited data on the use of ISENTRESS 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily in pregnant women. Animal Data In a combined embryo/fetal and pre/postnatal development study, raltegravir was administered orally to rats at doses of 100, 300, 600 mg/kg/day on gestation day 6 to 20 or from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. No effects on pre/postnatal development were observed up to the highest dose tested. Embryo-fetal findings were limited to an increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs in the 600 mg/kg/day group. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 600 mg/kg/day was approximately 3 times higher than exposure at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In pregnant rabbits, raltegravir was administered orally at doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day during the gestation days 7 to 20. No embryo/fetal effects were noted up to the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 1000 mg/kg/day was approximately 4 times higher than exposures at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In both species, raltegravir has been shown to cross the placenta, with fetal plasma concentrations observed in rats approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times greater than in maternal plasma and fetal plasma concentrations in rabbits approximately 2% that of maternal concentrations on gestation day 20. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. There are no data on the presence of raltegravir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When administered to lactating rats, raltegravir was present in milk (see Data ). Because of the potential for: 1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), 2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and 3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD. Data Raltegravir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration (600 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 6 to lactation day 14, with milk concentrations approximately 3 times that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 2 hours postdose on lactation day 14. 8.4 Pediatric Use ISENTRESS HIV-1 Infected Children The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of twice daily ISENTRESS were evaluated in HIV-1 infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial, IMPAACT P1066 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . HIV-1 Exposed Neonates The safety and pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS for oral suspension were evaluated in 42 full-term HIV-1 exposed neonates at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection in a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter clinical study, IMPAACT P1110. Cohort 1 neonates received 2 single doses of ISENTRESS for oral suspension: the first within 48 hours of birth and the second at 7 to 10 days of age. Cohort 2 neonates received daily dosing of ISENTRESS for oral suspension for 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through day 7 (week 1); 3 mg/kg twice daily on days 8 to 28 of age (weeks 2 to 4); and 6 mg/kg twice daily on days 29 to 42 of age (weeks 5 and 6). Sixteen neonates were enrolled in Cohort 1 (10 were exposed and 6 were unexposed to raltegravir in utero ) and 26 in Cohort 2 (all unexposed to raltegravir in utero ); all infants received a standard of care antiretroviral drug regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission. All enrolled neonates were followed for safety for a duration of 24 weeks. The 42 infants were 52% male, 69% Black and 12% Caucasian. HIV-1 status was assessed by nucleic acid test at birth, week 6 and week 24; all patients were HIV-1 negative at completion of the study. The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term neonates or in pediatric patients weighing less than 2 kg. ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS HD once daily has not been studied in pediatric patients. However population PK modeling and simulation support the use of 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS is necessary for patients with mild to moderate (Child-Pugh A and B) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD and therefore administration in subjects with hepatic impairment is not recommended. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown; therefore, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided."

All enrolled neonates were followed for safety for a duration of 24 weeks. The 42 infants were 52% male, 69% Black and 12% Caucasian. HIV-1 status was assessed by nucleic acid test at birth, week 6 and week 24; all patients were HIV-1 negative at completion of the study. The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term neonates or in pediatric patients weighing less than 2 kg. ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS HD once daily has not been studied in pediatric patients. However population PK modeling and simulation support the use of 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV-1 antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1.66 log 10 copies/mL by day 10. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 1.33 times the maximum approved recommended dose (and peak concentrations 1.25-fold higher than the maximum approved dose), raltegravir does not prolong the QT interval or PR interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir, given 400 mg twice daily, is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects. Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median T max of ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state. Raltegravir increases dose proportionally (AUC and C max ) or slightly less than dose proportionally (C 12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation, the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability. Steady-state is generally reached in 2 days, with little to no accumulation with multiple-dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 12. Table 12: Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Formulations PK parameter ratio (fed/fasted) Formulation Meal Type AUC Ratio (90% CI) C max Ratio (90% CI) C min Ratio (90% CI) Low fat meal: 300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat Moderate fat meal: 600 Kcal, 21 g fat High fat meal: 825 Kcal, 52 g fat 400 mg twice daily Low Fat 0.54 (0.41-0.71) 0.48 (0.35-0.67) 0.86 (0.54-1.36) Moderate Fat 1.13 (0.85-1.49) 1.05 (0.75-1.46) 1.66 (1.04-2.64) High Fat 2.11 (1.60-2.80) 1.96 (1.41-2.73) 4.13 (2.60-6.57) 1200 mg once daily Low Fat 0.58 (0.46-0.74) 0.48 (0.37-0.62) 0.84 (0.63-1.10) High Fat 1.02 (0.86-1.21) 0.72 (0.58-0.90) 0.88 (0.66-1.18) Chewable tablet High Fat 0.94 (0.78-1.14) 0.38 (0.28-0.52) 2.88 (2.21-3.75) Oral suspension The effect of food on oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 14, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age. Table 15 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates receiving the granules for oral suspension at the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK. Age/Race/Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age (18 years and older), race, or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe (24-hour creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown. Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A. In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Raltegravir drug interaction study results are shown in Tables 16 and 17. For information regarding clinical recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). No antagonism was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q, T97A, and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir treatment-failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. By Week 96 in the ONCEMRK trial, primary raltegravir resistance substitutions were observed in on treatment isolates obtained from 4 (3 with N155H and 1 with E92Q) of 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data in the 1200 mg QD arm and 2 (1 with N155H and 1 with T97A) of 6 virologic failure subjects in the 400 mg BID arm. Additional integrase substitutions observed included L74M, Q95K, V151I, E170A, I203M and D232N. These resistant isolates exhibited 6.2- to 19-fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir. Overall, at Week 96, detection of raltegravir resistance was not different between the QD and BID arms in subjects who were failing treatment and had resistance data evaluable (28.6% versus 33.3%, respectively). Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09). In the neonatal study IMPAACT P1110, there was no association between apparent clearance (CL/F) of raltegravir and UGT1A1 genotype polymorphisms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir, given 400 mg twice daily, is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects. Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median T max of ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state. Raltegravir increases dose proportionally (AUC and C max ) or slightly less than dose proportionally (C 12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation, the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability. Steady-state is generally reached in 2 days, with little to no accumulation with multiple-dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 12.

Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 14, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age. Table 15 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates receiving the granules for oral suspension at the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK. Age/Race/Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age (18 years and older), race, or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe (24-hour creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown. Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A. In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Raltegravir drug interaction study results are shown in Tables 16 and 17. For information regarding clinical recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). No antagonism was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q, T97A, and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir treatment-failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. By Week 96 in the ONCEMRK trial, primary raltegravir resistance substitutions were observed in on treatment isolates obtained from 4 (3 with N155H and 1 with E92Q) of 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data in the 1200 mg QD arm and 2 (1 with N155H and 1 with T97A) of 6 virologic failure subjects in the 400 mg BID arm. Additional integrase substitutions observed included L74M, Q95K, V151I, E170A, I203M and D232N. These resistant isolates exhibited 6.2- to 19-fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir. Overall, at Week 96, detection of raltegravir resistance was not different between the QD and BID arms in subjects who were failing treatment and had resistance data evaluable (28.6% versus 33.3%, respectively). Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir."

In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09). In the neonatal study IMPAACT P1110, there was no association between apparent clearance (CL/F) of raltegravir and UGT1A1 genotype polymorphisms."

At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was 1.8-fold (females) or 1.2-fold (males) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. Treatment-related squamous cell carcinoma of nose/nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg/kg/day raltegravir for 104 weeks. These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and/or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during dosing. No tumors of the nose/nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (males) and 50 mg/kg/day (females) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1.7-fold (males) to 1.4-fold (females) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage, and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies. No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in a 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose."

Randomization was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u226450,000 copies/mL; or >50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis status. In STARTMRK, 563 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There were 563 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 37 years (range: 19-71), 19% female, 58% non-white, 6% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 20% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 53% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 47% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm 3 ; the frequencies of these baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. ONCEMRK (ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [2 \u00d7 600 mg] once daily) ONCEMRK is a Phase 3 randomized, international, double-blind, active-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily versus ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1-infected subjects with HIV-1 RNA \u22651000 copies/mL. Randomization was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u2264100,000 or >100,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B and C infection status. In ONCEMRK, 797 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either raltegravir 1200 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There were 797 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 34 years (range: 18-84), 15% female, 41% non-white, 3% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 13% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 28% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 13% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm 3 ; the frequencies of these baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Table 19 shows the virologic outcomes in both studies. Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up.

Consistent efficacy in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily was observed across HIV subtypes with 80.6% (270/335) and 83.5% (162/194) of subjects with B and non-B subtypes respectively, achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at week 96 (Snapshot approach). 14.3 Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are Phase 3 studies to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with an optimized background therapy (OBT), versus OBT alone, in HIV-1-infected subjects, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NNRTIs, NRTIs, PIs) of antiretroviral therapies. Randomization was stratified by degree of resistance to PI (1PI vs. >1PI) and the use of enfuvirtide in the OBT. Prior to randomization, OBT was selected by the investigator based on genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing and prior ART history. Table 20 shows the demographic characteristics of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily and subjects in the placebo group.

The primary virology endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL at Week 24 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -12% for each study; and the frequency of adverse events up to 24 weeks. Subjects with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they each failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of switching to ISENTRESS versus continuing on lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In the combined analysis of these studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 82.3% of the ISENTRESS group versus 90.3% of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group. Clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment groups. 14.4 Pediatric Subjects 2 to 18 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open-label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment-experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Subjects were stratified by age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Subjects were enrolled into cohorts according to age and received the following formulations: Cohort I (12 to less than 18 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIa (6 to less than 12 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIb (6 to less than 12 years old), chewable tablet; Cohort III (2 to less than 6 years), chewable tablet. Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen. The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional subjects were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 subjects, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . These 96 subjects had a median age of 13 (range: 2 to 18) years, were 51% female, 34% Caucasian, and 59% Black. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log 10 copies/mL, median CD4 cell count was 481 cells/mm 3 (range: 0 \u2013 2361) and median CD4% was 23.3% (range: 0 \u2013 44). Overall, 8% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and 59% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. Most subjects had previously used at least one NNRTI (78%) or one PI (83%). Ninety-three (97%) subjects 2 to 18 years of age completed 24 weeks of treatment (3 discontinued due to non-compliance). At Week 24, 54% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL; 66% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 119 cells/mm 3 (3.8%). 4 Weeks to Less Than 2 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age (Cohorts IV and V) who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as an oral suspension without regard to food in combination with an optimized background regimen. The 26 subjects had a median age of 28 weeks (range: 4 -100), were 35% female, 85% Black and 8% Caucasian. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.7 log 10 copies/mL (range: 3.1 \u2013 7), median CD4 cell count was 1400 cells/mm 3 (range: 131 \u2013 3648) and median CD4% was 18.6% (range: 3.3 \u2013 39.3). Overall, 69% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA exceeding 100,000 copies/mL and 23% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. None of the 26 subjects were completely treatment-na\u00efve. All infants under 6 months of age had received nevirapine or zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-infant transmission, and 43% of subjects greater than 6 months of age had received two or more antiretrovirals. Of the 26 treated subjects, 23 subjects were included in the Week 24 and 48 efficacy analyses, respectively. All 26 treated subjects were included for safety analyses. At Week 24, 39% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 500 cells/mm 3 (7.5%). At Week 48, 44% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 492 cells/mm 3 (7.8%)."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Severe and Potentially Life-threatening Rash Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents, and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on the right side below the ribs). Inform patients that if severe rash occurs, their physician will closely monitor them, order laboratory tests and initiate appropriate therapy. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Rhabdomyolysis Before patients begin ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD, ask them if they have a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased creatine kinase or if they are taking medications known to cause these conditions such as statins, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil or zidovudine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Instruct patients to immediately report to their healthcare provider any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness while taking ISENTRESS. Phenylketonuria Alert patients with phenylketonuria that ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Drug Interactions Inform patients that ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD may interact with some drugs and ask them to identify all their current medications including over-the-counter agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Missed Dosage Inform patients that it is important to take ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD on a regular dosing schedule as instructed by their healthcare provider and to avoid missing doses as it can result in development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Important Administration Instructions Film-Coated Tablets Inform patients that the film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole. Oral Suspension Instruct parents and/or caregivers to read the Instructions for Use before preparing and administering ISENTRESS for oral suspension to pediatric patients. Instruct parents and/or caregivers that ISENTRESS for oral suspension should be administered within 30 minutes of mixing. Chewable Tablets Inform parents and/or caregivers that the chewable tablets can be chewed or swallowed whole. Additionally, the 25 mg chewable tablet may be crushed. Instruct parents and/or caregivers that ISENTRESS 25 mg chewable tablets, if crushed, should be administered immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Pregnancy Registry Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Lactation Instruct women with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] ."

Fill a clean glass with water Fill a clean glass with room-temperature drinking water from your sink or use bottled water. Step 3. Fill the blue syringe with water Push the plunger of the blue syringe into the syringe as far as it goes. Put the tip of the syringe into the glass of water. Pull back the plunger to draw up water into the syringe. Stop when you get to the 10mL mark. Step 4. Check for air bubbles Hold the syringe with tip up. Tap it with your finger to move any air bubbles up towards the tip. Slowly push up on the plunger to make the air come out. You may see some drops of water come out. Re-check the amount of water in the syringe. If it is less than 10mL, put the tip back into the water and pull back on the plunger until you get to the 10mL mark. Step 5. Add the 10mL of water to the mixing cup Add the 10 mL of water from the syringe to the mixing cup by pushing all the way down on the plunger. Step 6. Add ISENTRESS to the mixing cup Note before adding ISENTRESS: Make sure you and your child are ready! After mixing ISENTRESS, use it within 30 minutes . Throw away any leftover ISENTRESS after you have given the dose to your child. Take 1 packet of ISENTRESS and shake the powder to the bottom of the packet. Tear or cut open the packet at the dotted line and add all of the powder to the water in the mixing cup. Make sure the packet is completely empty. Step 7. Mix ISENTRESS and water Snap the lid of the mixing cup shut. Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder and water. Use a clock or timer to time for 45 seconds. Do not shake the mixture. Check to make sure the powder is mixed. If it is not mixed, swirl it some more. The mixture should look cloudy. Step 8. Check your prescription Find the dose amount in 'mL' prescribed by your doctor. This is written on the prescription label on the box from your pharmacy. Remember that the dose may change each time you go to the doctor, so make sure you check the prescribed dose each time. Be sure to go to all of your doctor's appointments so your child gets the right dose! Step 9. Choose the syringe you need Your doctor will prescribe the dose in milliliters (mL). Choose the right syringe for your child's dose: WHITE (1mL) for 1mL or less GREEN (3mL) for 1.5mL to 3mL BLUE (10mL) for 3.5mL to 10mL Then find the mL mark on the syringe that matches your child's dose. Step 10. Measure ISENTRESS Push the plunger into the barrel of the syringe as far as it goes. Put the tip of the syringe into the cup of the mixed ISENTRESS and pull back on the plunger. Stop when you get to the line that matches your child's prescribed dose. IMPORTANT: Your child's dose may be different from the one shown in this figure. There will usually be some leftover mixed ISENTRESS in the mixing cup. Step 11. Check for air bubbles Hold the syringe with tip up. Tap it with your finger to move any air bubbles up towards the tip. Slowly push the plunger to make the air come out. You may see some drops of medicine come out. Re-check the amount of ISENTRESS in the syringe. If it is less than the prescribed dose, put the tip back into the cup of mixed ISENTRESS and pull back on the plunger until you get to the right dose mark. Step 12. Give ISENTRESS to your child Place the tip of the syringe inside your child's mouth so that it touches either the right or left cheek. Slowly push in the plunger to give the dose of mixed ISENTRESS to your child. If your child fusses, take the tip of the syringe out of the mouth and try again. It is important that your child takes all of the prescribed dose (a little left in the syringe tip is OK). IMPORTANT: If your child does not take all of the prescribed dose or spits some of it out, call your doctor to find out what to do. Step 13. Clean up Pour the leftover mixed ISENTRESS into the trash. Do not pour it into the sink. Pull the plungers out of any syringes you used. Hand wash the syringes, plungers, and mixing cup with warm water and dish soap. Do not wash in the dishwasher. Rinse with water and let air dry. Put everything in a clean, dry place. How should I store ISENTRESS? Store the ISENTRESS for oral suspension kit at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Store in the original container. Keep ISENTRESS and all medicines out of the reach of children. Be sure to keep your doctor's appointments so you always know how much ISENTRESS to give to your child.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD can be administered with or without food ( 2.1 ). Do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg or 600 mg film-coated tablet. See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension ( 2.1 ). Adults Treatment-na\u00efve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily: 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) film-coated tablet orally, once daily or 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily ( 2.2 ). Treatment-experienced patients: 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily ( 2.2 ). During coadministration with rifampin in adults, 800 mg (2 \u00d7 400 mg) twice daily ( 2.2 ). Pediatrics If weighing at least 40 kg, and either treatment-na\u00efve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily: 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) film-coated tablet orally, once daily or 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily or 300 mg (3 \u00d7 100 mg) chewable tablets, twice daily ( 2.3 ). If weighing at least 25 kg: One 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily. If unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet, as specified in Table 2 ( 2.3 ). If weighing at least 3 kg to less than 25 kg: Weight-based dosing using the chewable tablet or oral suspension, as specified in Table 4 ( 2.3 ). For neonates (birth to 4 weeks [28 days] of age): Weight-based dosing of the oral suspension as specified in Table 5 ( 2.3 ). 2.1 General Dosing Recommendations Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles, do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg film-coated tablet or the ISENTRESS HD 600 mg film-coated tablet. See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension. Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . ISENTRESS film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole. ISENTRESS chewable tablets may be chewed or swallowed whole. Maximum daily dose is 300 mg taken by mouth twice daily. For children who have difficulty chewing the 25 mg chewable tablet, the tablet may be crushed. Preparation of the crushed 25 mg chewable tablet: Place the tablet(s) in a small, clean cup. For each tablet, add a teaspoonful (~5 mL) of liquid (for example, water, juice, or breast milk). Within 2 minutes, the tablet(s) will absorb the liquid and fall apart. Using a spoon, crush any remaining pieces of the tablet(s). Immediately administer the entire dose orally. If any portion of the dose is left in the cup, add another teaspoonful (~5 mL) of liquid, swirl and administer immediately. ISENTRESS for oral suspension: See Instructions for Use for details on preparation and administration of ISENTRESS for oral suspension. Using the provided mixing cup, combine 10 mL of water and the entire contents of one packet of ISENTRESS for oral suspension and mix. Each single-use packet for oral suspension contains 100 mg of raltegravir which is suspended in 10 mL of water giving a final concentration of 10 mg per mL. Maximum daily dose is 100 mg taken by mouth twice daily. Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder into a uniform suspension. Do not shake. Once mixed, measure the prescribed dose volume of suspension with a syringe and administer the dose orally. The dose should be administered orally within 30 minutes of mixing. Discard any remaining suspension into the trash. 2.2 Adults The recommended adult dosage of ISENTRESS film-coated tablets is displayed in Table 1. ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD should be taken by mouth and may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely ( 5.1 ). Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( 5.2 ). Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 100 mg and 25 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. 5.2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ISENTRESS. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.3 Phenylketonurics ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.05 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.10 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity (\u22652%) are insomnia, headache, dizziness, nausea and fatigue ( 6.1 ). Creatine kinase elevations were observed in subjects who received ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Treatment-Na\u00efve Adults The safety of ISENTRESS was evaluated in HIV-infected treatment-na\u00efve subjects in 2 Phase III studies: STARTMRK evaluated ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily versus efavirenz, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and ONCEMRK evaluated ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily versus ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Safety data from these two studies are presented side-by-side in Tables 6 and 7 to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up and study design. STARTMRK (ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily) In STARTMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (N=281) or efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg at bedtime (N=282) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, (N=282). During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was 1104 patient-years and 1036 patient-years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In STARTMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 240 was 5% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 10% in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. ONCEMRK (ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [2 \u00d7 600 mg] once daily) In ONCEMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily (n=531) or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (n=266) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily was 913 patient-years and for ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily was 450 patient-years. In ONCEMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 96 was 1% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily and 2% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of treatment-na\u00efve subjects treated with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz in STARTMRK through Week 240 or ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in ONCEMRK through Week 96 are presented in Table 6. In STARTMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in \u22652% of subjects on ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 240 also include diarrhea, flatulence, asthenia, decreased appetite, abnormal dreams, depression and nightmare. In ONCEMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in \u22652% of subjects on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 96 also include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Table 6: Adverse Reactions Includes adverse experiences considered by investigators to be at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe Intensity Intensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

If the missing data was due to other reasons, subjects were censored thereafter for the analysis. At baseline, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 5% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 3% in the efavirenz group. Through Week 240, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 9% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 15% in the efavirenz group.

A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT. The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo. The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient-years versus 244 patient-years on placebo. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5% in subjects receiving placebo. Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT. Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Adverse Drug Reactions Includes adverse reactions at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe Intensity Intensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

These events have been included because of their seriousness, increased frequency compared with efavirenz or placebo, or investigator's assessment of potential causal relationship. Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations: genital herpes, herpes zoster Psychiatric Disorders: depression (particularly in subjects with a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and behaviors Renal and Urinary Disorders: nephrolithiasis, renal failure Selected Adverse Events - Adults In studies of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-na\u00efve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm 3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator. Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD (see Tables 6 and 8 ). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. Patients with Co-existing Conditions - Adults Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In Phase III studies of ISENTRESS, patients with chronic (but not acute) active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the treatment-experienced studies, BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, 16% of all patients (114/699) were co-infected; in the treatment-na\u00efve studies, STARTMRK and ONCEMRK, 6% (34/563) and 3% (23/797), respectively, were co-infected. In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection for all treatment groups. At 96 weeks, in treatment-experienced subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29%, 34% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11%, 10% and 9% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 240 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22%, 44% and 17%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 13%, 13% and 5% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 96 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27%, 40% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily as compared to 7%, 5% and 3% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily. Pediatrics 2 to 18 Years of Age ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS. In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash. One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious. 4 Weeks to Less than 2 Years of Age ISENTRESS has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation. HIV-1 Exposed Neonates Forty-two neonates were treated with ISENTRESS for up to 6 weeks from birth, and followed for a total of 24 weeks in IMPAACT P1110 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. There were no drug related clinical adverse reactions and three drug related laboratory adverse reactions (one case of transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine-containing regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). The safety profile in neonates was generally similar to that observed in older patients treated with ISENTRESS. No clinically meaningful differences in the adverse event profile of neonates were observed when compared to adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) in patients with underlying liver disease and/or concomitant medications Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: cerebellar ataxia Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, paranoia"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy ( 7 ). Coadministration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir ( 2.1 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway. Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir and coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that induce UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may reduce plasma levels of raltegravir (see Table 11 ). Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 11 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In some cases, recommendations differ for ISENTRESS versus ISENTRESS HD. Table 11: Selected Drug Interactions in Adults Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Raltegravir Clinical Comment for ISENTRESS Clinical Comment for ISENTRESS HD Metal-Containing Antacids Aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids \u2193 Coadministration or staggered administration is not recommended. Calcium carbonate antacid \u2193 No dose adjustment Co-administration is not recommended Other Agents Rifampin \u2193 The recommended dosage is 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Coadministration is not recommended. Tipranavir/ritonavir No dose adjustment Coadministration is not recommended Etravirine \u2193 No dose adjustment Coadministration is not recommended. Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes not mentioned above e.g., Carbamazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin \u2193\u2194 The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown. Coadministration is not recommended. 7.2 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS In drug interaction studies performed using ISENTRESS film-coated tablets 400 mg twice daily dose, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, methadone, midazolam, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, etravirine, darunavir/ritonavir, or boceprevir. Moreover, atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, calcium carbonate antacids, darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, etravirine, omeprazole, or tipranavir/ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg twice daily raltegravir. No dose adjustment is required when ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily is coadministered with these drugs. There is no predicted pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ISENTRESS and tenofovir alafenamide. ISENTRESS HD In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. No dose adjustment is recommended when ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily is coadministered with atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, darunavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, efavirenz and omeprazole. There is no predicted pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ISENTRESS HD and tenofovir alafenamide."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no difference in the rate of overall birth defects for raltegravir compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) (see Data ) . The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15-20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at <20 weeks gestation (see Data ) . In animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with oral administration of raltegravir during organogenesis at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1200 mg (see Data ) . Data Human Data Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 850 exposures to raltegravir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 450 exposures in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for raltegravir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 1.7% to 5.1%) following first trimester exposure to raltegravir-containing regimens and 3.7% (95% CI: 2.1% to 6.0%) following second and third trimester exposure to raltegravir-containing regimens. There are limited data on the use of ISENTRESS 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily in pregnant women. Animal Data In a combined embryo/fetal and pre/postnatal development study, raltegravir was administered orally to rats at doses of 100, 300, 600 mg/kg/day on gestation day 6 to 20 or from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. No effects on pre/postnatal development were observed up to the highest dose tested. Embryo-fetal findings were limited to an increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs in the 600 mg/kg/day group. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 600 mg/kg/day was approximately 3 times higher than exposure at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In pregnant rabbits, raltegravir was administered orally at doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day during the gestation days 7 to 20. No embryo/fetal effects were noted up to the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 1000 mg/kg/day was approximately 4 times higher than exposures at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In both species, raltegravir has been shown to cross the placenta, with fetal plasma concentrations observed in rats approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times greater than in maternal plasma and fetal plasma concentrations in rabbits approximately 2% that of maternal concentrations on gestation day 20. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. There are no data on the presence of raltegravir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When administered to lactating rats, raltegravir was present in milk (see Data ). Because of the potential for: 1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), 2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and 3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD. Data Raltegravir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration (600 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 6 to lactation day 14, with milk concentrations approximately 3 times that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 2 hours postdose on lactation day 14. 8.4 Pediatric Use ISENTRESS HIV-1 Infected Children The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of twice daily ISENTRESS were evaluated in HIV-1 infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial, IMPAACT P1066 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . HIV-1 Exposed Neonates The safety and pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS for oral suspension were evaluated in 42 full-term HIV-1 exposed neonates at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection in a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter clinical study, IMPAACT P1110. Cohort 1 neonates received 2 single doses of ISENTRESS for oral suspension: the first within 48 hours of birth and the second at 7 to 10 days of age. Cohort 2 neonates received daily dosing of ISENTRESS for oral suspension for 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through day 7 (week 1); 3 mg/kg twice daily on days 8 to 28 of age (weeks 2 to 4); and 6 mg/kg twice daily on days 29 to 42 of age (weeks 5 and 6). Sixteen neonates were enrolled in Cohort 1 (10 were exposed and 6 were unexposed to raltegravir in utero ) and 26 in Cohort 2 (all unexposed to raltegravir in utero ); all infants received a standard of care antiretroviral drug regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission. All enrolled neonates were followed for safety for a duration of 24 weeks. The 42 infants were 52% male, 69% Black and 12% Caucasian. HIV-1 status was assessed by nucleic acid test at birth, week 6 and week 24; all patients were HIV-1 negative at completion of the study. The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term neonates or in pediatric patients weighing less than 2 kg. ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS HD once daily has not been studied in pediatric patients. However population PK modeling and simulation support the use of 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS is necessary for patients with mild to moderate (Child-Pugh A and B) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD and therefore administration in subjects with hepatic impairment is not recommended. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown; therefore, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided."

Embryo-fetal findings were limited to an increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs in the 600 mg/kg/day group. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 600 mg/kg/day was approximately 3 times higher than exposure at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In pregnant rabbits, raltegravir was administered orally at doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day during the gestation days 7 to 20. No embryo/fetal effects were noted up to the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 1000 mg/kg/day was approximately 4 times higher than exposures at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In both species, raltegravir has been shown to cross the placenta, with fetal plasma concentrations observed in rats approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times greater than in maternal plasma and fetal plasma concentrations in rabbits approximately 2% that of maternal concentrations on gestation day 20."

The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . HIV-1 Exposed Neonates The safety and pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS for oral suspension were evaluated in 42 full-term HIV-1 exposed neonates at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection in a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter clinical study, IMPAACT P1110. Cohort 1 neonates received 2 single doses of ISENTRESS for oral suspension: the first within 48 hours of birth and the second at 7 to 10 days of age. Cohort 2 neonates received daily dosing of ISENTRESS for oral suspension for 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through day 7 (week 1); 3 mg/kg twice daily on days 8 to 28 of age (weeks 2 to 4); and 6 mg/kg twice daily on days 29 to 42 of age (weeks 5 and 6). Sixteen neonates were enrolled in Cohort 1 (10 were exposed and 6 were unexposed to raltegravir in utero ) and 26 in Cohort 2 (all unexposed to raltegravir in utero ); all infants received a standard of care antiretroviral drug regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission. All enrolled neonates were followed for safety for a duration of 24 weeks. The 42 infants were 52% male, 69% Black and 12% Caucasian. HIV-1 status was assessed by nucleic acid test at birth, week 6 and week 24; all patients were HIV-1 negative at completion of the study. The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term neonates or in pediatric patients weighing less than 2 kg. ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS HD once daily has not been studied in pediatric patients. However population PK modeling and simulation support the use of 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV-1 antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1.66 log 10 copies/mL by day 10. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 1.33 times the maximum approved recommended dose (and peak concentrations 1.25-fold higher than the maximum approved dose), raltegravir does not prolong the QT interval or PR interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir, given 400 mg twice daily, is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects. Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median T max of ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state. Raltegravir increases dose proportionally (AUC and C max ) or slightly less than dose proportionally (C 12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation, the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability. Steady-state is generally reached in 2 days, with little to no accumulation with multiple-dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 12. Table 12: Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Formulations PK parameter ratio (fed/fasted) Formulation Meal Type AUC Ratio (90% CI) C max Ratio (90% CI) C min Ratio (90% CI) Low fat meal: 300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat Moderate fat meal: 600 Kcal, 21 g fat High fat meal: 825 Kcal, 52 g fat 400 mg twice daily Low Fat 0.54 (0.41-0.71) 0.48 (0.35-0.67) 0.86 (0.54-1.36) Moderate Fat 1.13 (0.85-1.49) 1.05 (0.75-1.46) 1.66 (1.04-2.64) High Fat 2.11 (1.60-2.80) 1.96 (1.41-2.73) 4.13 (2.60-6.57) 1200 mg once daily Low Fat 0.58 (0.46-0.74) 0.48 (0.37-0.62) 0.84 (0.63-1.10) High Fat 1.02 (0.86-1.21) 0.72 (0.58-0.90) 0.88 (0.66-1.18) Chewable tablet High Fat 0.94 (0.78-1.14) 0.38 (0.28-0.52) 2.88 (2.21-3.75) Oral suspension The effect of food on oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 14, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age. Table 15 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates receiving the granules for oral suspension at the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK. Age/Race/Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age (18 years and older), race, or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe (24-hour creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown. Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A. In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Raltegravir drug interaction study results are shown in Tables 16 and 17. For information regarding clinical recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). No antagonism was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q, T97A, and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir treatment-failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. By Week 96 in the ONCEMRK trial, primary raltegravir resistance substitutions were observed in on treatment isolates obtained from 4 (3 with N155H and 1 with E92Q) of 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data in the 1200 mg QD arm and 2 (1 with N155H and 1 with T97A) of 6 virologic failure subjects in the 400 mg BID arm. Additional integrase substitutions observed included L74M, Q95K, V151I, E170A, I203M and D232N. These resistant isolates exhibited 6.2- to 19-fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir. Overall, at Week 96, detection of raltegravir resistance was not different between the QD and BID arms in subjects who were failing treatment and had resistance data evaluable (28.6% versus 33.3%, respectively). Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09). In the neonatal study IMPAACT P1110, there was no association between apparent clearance (CL/F) of raltegravir and UGT1A1 genotype polymorphisms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir, given 400 mg twice daily, is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects. Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median T max of ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state. Raltegravir increases dose proportionally (AUC and C max ) or slightly less than dose proportionally (C 12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation, the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability. Steady-state is generally reached in 2 days, with little to no accumulation with multiple-dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 12. Table 12: Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Formulations PK parameter ratio (fed/fasted) Formulation Meal Type AUC Ratio (90% CI) C max Ratio (90% CI) C min Ratio (90% CI) Low fat meal: 300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat Moderate fat meal: 600 Kcal, 21 g fat High fat meal: 825 Kcal, 52 g fat 400 mg twice daily Low Fat 0.54 (0.41-0.71) 0.48 (0.35-0.67) 0.86 (0.54-1.36) Moderate Fat 1.13 (0.85-1.49) 1.05 (0.75-1.46) 1.66 (1.04-2.64) High Fat 2.11 (1.60-2.80) 1.96 (1.41-2.73) 4.13 (2.60-6.57) 1200 mg once daily Low Fat 0.58 (0.46-0.74) 0.48 (0.37-0.62) 0.84 (0.63-1.10) High Fat 1.02 (0.86-1.21) 0.72 (0.58-0.90) 0.88 (0.66-1.18) Chewable tablet High Fat 0.94 (0.78-1.14) 0.38 (0.28-0.52) 2.88 (2.21-3.75) Oral suspension The effect of food on oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 14, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age. Table 15 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates receiving the granules for oral suspension at the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK. Age/Race/Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age (18 years and older), race, or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe (24-hour creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown. Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A. In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Raltegravir drug interaction study results are shown in Tables 16 and 17. For information regarding clinical recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). No antagonism was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q, T97A, and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir treatment-failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. By Week 96 in the ONCEMRK trial, primary raltegravir resistance substitutions were observed in on treatment isolates obtained from 4 (3 with N155H and 1 with E92Q) of 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data in the 1200 mg QD arm and 2 (1 with N155H and 1 with T97A) of 6 virologic failure subjects in the 400 mg BID arm. Additional integrase substitutions observed included L74M, Q95K, V151I, E170A, I203M and D232N. These resistant isolates exhibited 6.2- to 19-fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir. Overall, at Week 96, detection of raltegravir resistance was not different between the QD and BID arms in subjects who were failing treatment and had resistance data evaluable (28.6% versus 33.3%, respectively). Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir."

In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09). In the neonatal study IMPAACT P1110, there was no association between apparent clearance (CL/F) of raltegravir and UGT1A1 genotype polymorphisms."

At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was 1.8-fold (females) or 1.2-fold (males) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. Treatment-related squamous cell carcinoma of nose/nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg/kg/day raltegravir for 104 weeks. These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and/or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during dosing. No tumors of the nose/nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (males) and 50 mg/kg/day (females) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1.7-fold (males) to 1.4-fold (females) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage, and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies. No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in a 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose."

Randomization was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u226450,000 copies/mL; or >50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis status. In STARTMRK, 563 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There were 563 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 37 years (range: 19-71), 19% female, 58% non-white, 6% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 20% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 53% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 47% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm 3 ; the frequencies of these baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups.

Randomization was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u2264100,000 or >100,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B and C infection status. In ONCEMRK, 797 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either raltegravir 1200 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There were 797 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 34 years (range: 18-84), 15% female, 41% non-white, 3% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 13% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 28% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 13% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm 3 ; the frequencies of these baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Table 19 shows the virologic outcomes in both studies. Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up.

Consistent efficacy in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily was observed across HIV subtypes with 80.6% (270/335) and 83.5% (162/194) of subjects with B and non-B subtypes respectively, achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at week 96 (Snapshot approach). 14.3 Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are Phase 3 studies to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with an optimized background therapy (OBT), versus OBT alone, in HIV-1-infected subjects, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NNRTIs, NRTIs, PIs) of antiretroviral therapies. Randomization was stratified by degree of resistance to PI (1PI vs. >1PI) and the use of enfuvirtide in the OBT. Prior to randomization, OBT was selected by the investigator based on genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing and prior ART history. Table 20 shows the demographic characteristics of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily and subjects in the placebo group.

The primary virology endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL at Week 24 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -12% for each study; and the frequency of adverse events up to 24 weeks. Subjects with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they each failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of switching to ISENTRESS versus continuing on lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In the combined analysis of these studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 82.3% of the ISENTRESS group versus 90.3% of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group. Clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment groups. 14.4 Pediatric Subjects 2 to 18 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open-label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment-experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Subjects were stratified by age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Subjects were enrolled into cohorts according to age and received the following formulations: Cohort I (12 to less than 18 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIa (6 to less than 12 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIb (6 to less than 12 years old), chewable tablet; Cohort III (2 to less than 6 years), chewable tablet. Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen. The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional subjects were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 subjects, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . These 96 subjects had a median age of 13 (range: 2 to 18) years, were 51% female, 34% Caucasian, and 59% Black. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log 10 copies/mL, median CD4 cell count was 481 cells/mm 3 (range: 0 \u2013 2361) and median CD4% was 23.3% (range: 0 \u2013 44). Overall, 8% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and 59% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. Most subjects had previously used at least one NNRTI (78%) or one PI (83%). Ninety-three (97%) subjects 2 to 18 years of age completed 24 weeks of treatment (3 discontinued due to non-compliance). At Week 24, 54% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL; 66% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 119 cells/mm 3 (3.8%). 4 Weeks to Less Than 2 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age (Cohorts IV and V) who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as an oral suspension without regard to food in combination with an optimized background regimen. The 26 subjects had a median age of 28 weeks (range: 4 -100), were 35% female, 85% Black and 8% Caucasian. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.7 log 10 copies/mL (range: 3.1 \u2013 7), median CD4 cell count was 1400 cells/mm 3 (range: 131 \u2013 3648) and median CD4% was 18.6% (range: 3.3 \u2013 39.3). Overall, 69% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA exceeding 100,000 copies/mL and 23% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. None of the 26 subjects were completely treatment-na\u00efve. All infants under 6 months of age had received nevirapine or zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-infant transmission, and 43% of subjects greater than 6 months of age had received two or more antiretrovirals. Of the 26 treated subjects, 23 subjects were included in the Week 24 and 48 efficacy analyses, respectively. All 26 treated subjects were included for safety analyses. At Week 24, 39% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 500 cells/mm 3 (7.5%). At Week 48, 44% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 492 cells/mm 3 (7.8%)."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Severe and Potentially Life-threatening Rash Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents, and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on the right side below the ribs). Inform patients that if severe rash occurs, their physician will closely monitor them, order laboratory tests and initiate appropriate therapy. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Rhabdomyolysis Before patients begin ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD, ask them if they have a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased creatine kinase or if they are taking medications known to cause these conditions such as statins, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil or zidovudine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Instruct patients to immediately report to their healthcare provider any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness while taking ISENTRESS. Phenylketonuria Alert patients with phenylketonuria that ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Drug Interactions Inform patients that ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD may interact with some drugs and ask them to identify all their current medications including over-the-counter agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Missed Dosage Inform patients that it is important to take ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD on a regular dosing schedule as instructed by their healthcare provider and to avoid missing doses as it can result in development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Important Administration Instructions Film-Coated Tablets Inform patients that the film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole. Oral Suspension Instruct parents and/or caregivers to read the Instructions for Use before preparing and administering ISENTRESS for oral suspension to pediatric patients.

      "Bring this booklet to your child's appointments. ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral suspension Instructions for Use for babies and toddlers Before You Start Note: Make sure your doctor shows you how to prepare and give ISENTRESS for oral suspension. Be sure you understand these instructions before you start. Call your doctor if you have any questions. It is very important that you measure the water and ISENTRESS carefully using the correct syringe. Before you give ISENTRESS to your child, check the expiration date. The expiration date is printed on the box and the ISENTRESS packets. Do not open the ISENTRESS packets until you are ready to mix a dose. The amount of ISENTRESS depends on your child's age and weight, so it will change over time. Your doctor will tell you the right dose at each check-up after weighing your child. Be sure to keep your doctor's appointments so you get new dosing information as your child grows. During your child's first week of life, you will give ISENTRESS 1 time a day. After the first week of life, you will give it 2 times a day. This booklet tells you how to: Mix ISENTRESS into a liquid form Measure the right dose using a syringe Give mixed ISENTRESS to your child Clean up Kit Contents Prescription (on box) 2 mixing cups Instructions for Use (this booklet) Prescribing Information 6 syringes 60 packets of ISENTRESS 2 blue (10mL) syringes 2 green (3mL) syringes 2 white (1mL) syringes The kit has an extra cup and set of syringes in case one is lost or damaged. Do not use any damaged cups or syringes. Step 1. Get ready Put your child in a safe place. You will need both hands to prepare ISENTRESS. Wash your hands with soap and water. Take out what you need from the kit as shown below to make 1 dose and place on a clean surface: 1 mixing cup (Using the tab on the mixing cup, pull open the lid) 1 packet of ISENTRESS a clean glass 3 syringes (Have one of each size ready, but you will only need 1 or 2, depending on the prescribed dose) Step 2. Fill a clean glass with water Fill a clean glass with room-temperature drinking water from your sink or use bottled water. Step 3. Fill the blue syringe with water Push the plunger of the blue syringe into the syringe as far as it goes. Put the tip of the syringe into the glass of water. Pull back the plunger to draw up water into the syringe. Stop when you get to the 10mL mark. Step 4. Check for air bubbles Hold the syringe with tip up. Tap it with your finger to move any air bubbles up towards the tip. Slowly push up on the plunger to make the air come out. You may see some drops of water come out. Re-check the amount of water in the syringe. If it is less than 10mL, put the tip back into the water and pull back on the plunger until you get to the 10mL mark. Step 5. Add the 10mL of water to the mixing cup Add the 10 mL of water from the syringe to the mixing cup by pushing all the way down on the plunger. Step 6. Add ISENTRESS to the mixing cup Note before adding ISENTRESS: Make sure you and your child are ready! After mixing ISENTRESS, use it within 30 minutes . Throw away any leftover ISENTRESS after you have given the dose to your child. Take 1 packet of ISENTRESS and shake the powder to the bottom of the packet. Tear or cut open the packet at the dotted line and add all of the powder to the water in the mixing cup. Make sure the packet is completely empty. Step 7. Mix ISENTRESS and water Snap the lid of the mixing cup shut. Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder and water. Use a clock or timer to time for 45 seconds. Do not shake the mixture. Check to make sure the powder is mixed. If it is not mixed, swirl it some more. The mixture should look cloudy. Step 8. Check your prescription Find the dose amount in 'mL' prescribed by your doctor. This is written on the prescription label on the box from your pharmacy. Remember that the dose may change each time you go to the doctor, so make sure you check the prescribed dose each time. Be sure to go to all of your doctor's appointments so your child gets the right dose! Step 9. Choose the syringe you need Your doctor will prescribe the dose in milliliters (mL). Choose the right syringe for your child's dose: WHITE (1mL) for 1mL or less GREEN (3mL) for 1.5mL to 3mL BLUE (10mL) for 3.5mL to 10mL Then find the mL mark on the syringe that matches your child's dose. Step 10. Measure ISENTRESS Push the plunger into the barrel of the syringe as far as it goes. Put the tip of the syringe into the cup of the mixed ISENTRESS and pull back on the plunger. Stop when you get to the line that matches your child's prescribed dose. IMPORTANT: Your child's dose may be different from the one shown in this figure. There will usually be some leftover mixed ISENTRESS in the mixing cup. Step 11. Check for air bubbles Hold the syringe with tip up. Tap it with your finger to move any air bubbles up towards the tip. Slowly push the plunger to make the air come out. You may see some drops of medicine come out. Re-check the amount of ISENTRESS in the syringe. If it is less than the prescribed dose, put the tip back into the cup of mixed ISENTRESS and pull back on the plunger until you get to the right dose mark. Step 12. Give ISENTRESS to your child Place the tip of the syringe inside your child's mouth so that it touches either the right or left cheek. Slowly push in the plunger to give the dose of mixed ISENTRESS to your child. If your child fusses, take the tip of the syringe out of the mouth and try again. It is important that your child takes all of the prescribed dose (a little left in the syringe tip is OK). IMPORTANT: If your child does not take all of the prescribed dose or spits some of it out, call your doctor to find out what to do. Step 13. Clean up Pour the leftover mixed ISENTRESS into the trash. Do not pour it into the sink. Pull the plungers out of any syringes you used. Hand wash the syringes, plungers, and mixing cup with warm water and dish soap. Do not wash in the dishwasher. Rinse with water and let air dry. Put everything in a clean, dry place. How should I store ISENTRESS? Store the ISENTRESS for oral suspension kit at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Store in the original container. Keep ISENTRESS and all medicines out of the reach of children. Be sure to keep your doctor's appointments so you always know how much ISENTRESS to give to your child.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD can be administered with or without food ( 2.1 ). Do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg or 600 mg film-coated tablet. See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension ( 2.1 ). Adults \u2022 Treatment-na\u00efve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily: o 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) film-coated tablet orally, once daily or o 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily ( 2.2 ). \u2022 Treatment-experienced patients: o 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily ( 2.2 ). \u2022 During coadministration with rifampin in adults, 800 mg (2 \u00d7 400 mg) twice daily ( 2.2 ). Pediatrics \u2022 If weighing at least 40 kg, and either o treatment-na\u00efve patients or o patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily: \u25aa 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) film-coated tablet orally, once daily or \u25aa 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily or \u25aa 300 mg (3 \u00d7 100 mg) chewable tablets, twice daily ( 2.3 ). \u2022 If weighing at least 25 kg: One 400 mg film-coated tablet orally, twice daily. If unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet, as specified in Table 2 ( 2.3 ). \u2022 If weighing at least 3 kg to less than 25 kg: Weight-based dosing using the chewable tablet or oral suspension, as specified in Table 4 ( 2.3 ). \u2022 For neonates (birth to 4 weeks [28 days] of age): Weight-based dosing of the oral suspension as specified in Table 5 ( 2.3 ). 2.1 General Dosing Recommendations \u2022 Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles, do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg film-coated tablet or the ISENTRESS HD 600 mg film-coated tablet. See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension. \u2022 Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . \u2022 ISENTRESS film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole. \u2022 ISENTRESS chewable tablets may be chewed or swallowed whole. Maximum daily dose is 300 mg taken by mouth twice daily. \u2022 For children who have difficulty chewing the 25 mg chewable tablet, the tablet may be crushed. o Preparation of the crushed 25 mg chewable tablet: \u25aa Place the tablet(s) in a small, clean cup. For each tablet, add a teaspoonful (~5 mL) of liquid (for example, water, juice, or breast milk). \u25aa Within 2 minutes, the tablet(s) will absorb the liquid and fall apart. \u25aa Using a spoon, crush any remaining pieces of the tablet(s). Immediately administer the entire dose orally. \u25aa If any portion of the dose is left in the cup, add another teaspoonful (~5 mL) of liquid, swirl and administer immediately. \u2022 ISENTRESS for oral suspension: o See Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. for details on preparation and administration of ISENTRESS for oral suspension. o Using the provided mixing cup, combine 10 mL of water and the entire contents of one packet of ISENTRESS for oral suspension and mix. Each single-use packet for oral suspension contains 100 mg of raltegravir which is suspended in 10 mL of water giving a final concentration of 10 mg per mL. Maximum daily dose is 100 mg taken by mouth twice daily. o Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder into a uniform suspension. Do not shake. o Once mixed, measure the prescribed dose volume of suspension with a syringe and administer the dose orally. The dose should be administered orally within 30 minutes of mixing. o Discard any remaining suspension into the trash. 2.2 Adults The recommended adult dosage of ISENTRESS film-coated tablets is displayed in Table 1. ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD should be taken by mouth and may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 100 mg and 25 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. 5.2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ISENTRESS. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.3 Phenylketonurics ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.05 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.10 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \u2022 The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity (\u22652%) are insomnia, headache, dizziness, nausea and fatigue ( 6.1 ). \u2022 Creatine kinase elevations were observed in subjects who received ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported.

Safety data from these two studies are presented side-by-side in Tables 6 and 7 to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up and study design. STARTMRK (ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily) In STARTMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (N=281) or efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg at bedtime (N=282) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, (N=282). During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was 1104 patient-years and 1036 patient-years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In STARTMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 240 was 5% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 10% in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. ONCEMRK (ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [2 \u00d7 600 mg] once daily) In ONCEMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily (n=531) or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (n=266) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily was 913 patient-years and for ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily was 450 patient-years. In ONCEMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 96 was 1% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily and 2% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of treatment-na\u00efve subjects treated with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz in STARTMRK through Week 240 or ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in ONCEMRK through Week 96 are presented in Table 6. In STARTMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in \u22652% of subjects on ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 240 also include diarrhea, flatulence, asthenia, decreased appetite, abnormal dreams, depression and nightmare. In ONCEMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in \u22652% of subjects on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 96 also include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Table 6: Adverse Reactions Includes adverse experiences considered by investigators to be at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe Intensity Intensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

The analysis is based on all available data. If subjects initiated or increased serum lipid-reducing agents, the last available lipid values prior to the change in therapy were used in the analysis. If the missing data was due to other reasons, subjects were censored thereafter for the analysis. At baseline, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 5% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 3% in the efavirenz group. Through Week 240, serum lipid-reducing agents were used in 9% of subjects in the group receiving ISENTRESS and 15% in the efavirenz group.

A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT. The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo. The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient-years versus 244 patient-years on placebo. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5% in subjects receiving placebo. Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT. Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in \u22652% of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 9. Table 9: Adverse Drug Reactions Includes adverse reactions at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe Intensity Intensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

These events have been included because of their seriousness, increased frequency compared with efavirenz or placebo, or investigator's assessment of potential causal relationship. Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations: genital herpes, herpes zoster Psychiatric Disorders: depression (particularly in subjects with a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and behaviors Renal and Urinary Disorders: nephrolithiasis, renal failure Selected Adverse Events - Adults In studies of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-na\u00efve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm 3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator. Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD (see Tables 6 and 8 ). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. Patients with Co-existing Conditions - Adults Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In Phase III studies of ISENTRESS, patients with chronic (but not acute) active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the treatment-experienced studies, BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, 16% of all patients (114/699) were co-infected; in the treatment-na\u00efve studies, STARTMRK and ONCEMRK, 6% (34/563) and 3% (23/797), respectively, were co-infected. In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection for all treatment groups. At 96 weeks, in treatment-experienced subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29%, 34% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11%, 10% and 9% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 240 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22%, 44% and 17%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 13%, 13% and 5% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 96 weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27%, 40% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily as compared to 7%, 5% and 3% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily. Pediatrics 2 to 18 Years of Age ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS. In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash. One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious. 4 Weeks to Less than 2 Years of Age ISENTRESS has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults. One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation. HIV-1 Exposed Neonates Forty-two neonates were treated with ISENTRESS for up to 6 weeks from birth, and followed for a total of 24 weeks in IMPAACT P1110 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. There were no drug related clinical adverse reactions and three drug related laboratory adverse reactions (one case of transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine-containing regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). The safety profile in neonates was generally similar to that observed in older patients treated with ISENTRESS. No clinically meaningful differences in the adverse event profile of neonates were observed when compared to adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) in patients with underlying liver disease and/or concomitant medications Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: cerebellar ataxia Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, paranoia"

The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy ( 7 ). \u2022 Coadministration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir ( 2.1 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway. Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir and coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that induce UGT1A1, such as rifampin, may reduce plasma levels of raltegravir (see Table 11 ). Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 11 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In some cases, recommendations differ for ISENTRESS versus ISENTRESS HD. Table 11: Selected Drug Interactions in Adults Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Raltegravir Clinical Comment for ISENTRESS Clinical Comment for ISENTRESS HD Metal-Containing Antacids Aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids \u2193 Coadministration or staggered administration is not recommended. Calcium carbonate antacid \u2193 No dose adjustment Co-administration is not recommended Other Agents Rifampin \u2193 The recommended dosage is 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Coadministration is not recommended. Tipranavir/ritonavir No dose adjustment Coadministration is not recommended Etravirine \u2193 No dose adjustment Coadministration is not recommended. Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes not mentioned above e.g., Carbamazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin \u2193\u2194 The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown. Coadministration is not recommended. 7.2 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS In drug interaction studies performed using ISENTRESS film-coated tablets 400 mg twice daily dose, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, methadone, midazolam, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, etravirine, darunavir/ritonavir, or boceprevir. Moreover, atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, calcium carbonate antacids, darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, etravirine, omeprazole, or tipranavir/ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg twice daily raltegravir. No dose adjustment is required when ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily is coadministered with these drugs. There is no predicted pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ISENTRESS and tenofovir alafenamide. ISENTRESS HD In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. No dose adjustment is recommended when ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily is coadministered with atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, darunavir/ritonavir, boceprevir, efavirenz and omeprazole. There is no predicted pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ISENTRESS HD and tenofovir alafenamide."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no difference in the rate of overall birth defects for raltegravir compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15-20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at <20 weeks gestation (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . In animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with oral administration of raltegravir during organogenesis at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1200 mg (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) . Data Human Data Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 850 exposures to raltegravir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 450 exposures in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for raltegravir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 1.7% to 5.1%) following first trimester exposure to raltegravir-containing regimens and 3.7% (95% CI: 2.1% to 6.0%) following second and third trimester exposure to raltegravir-containing regimens. There are limited data on the use of ISENTRESS 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily in pregnant women. Animal Data In a combined embryo/fetal and pre/postnatal development study, raltegravir was administered orally to rats at doses of 100, 300, 600 mg/kg/day on gestation day 6 to 20 or from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. No effects on pre/postnatal development were observed up to the highest dose tested. Embryo-fetal findings were limited to an increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs in the 600 mg/kg/day group. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 600 mg/kg/day was approximately 3 times higher than exposure at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In pregnant rabbits, raltegravir was administered orally at doses of 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day during the gestation days 7 to 20. No embryo/fetal effects were noted up to the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure (AUC) at 1000 mg/kg/day was approximately 4 times higher than exposures at the MRHD of 1200 mg. In both species, raltegravir has been shown to cross the placenta, with fetal plasma concentrations observed in rats approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times greater than in maternal plasma and fetal plasma concentrations in rabbits approximately 2% that of maternal concentrations on gestation day 20. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. There are no data on the presence of raltegravir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When administered to lactating rats, raltegravir was present in milk (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Because of the potential for: 1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), 2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and 3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD. Data Raltegravir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration (600 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 6 to lactation day 14, with milk concentrations approximately 3 times that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 2 hours postdose on lactation day 14. 8.4 Pediatric Use ISENTRESS HIV-1 Infected Children The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of twice daily ISENTRESS were evaluated in HIV-1 infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial, IMPAACT P1066 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . HIV-1 Exposed Neonates The safety and pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS for oral suspension were evaluated in 42 full-term HIV-1 exposed neonates at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection in a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter clinical study, IMPAACT P1110. Cohort 1 neonates received 2 single doses of ISENTRESS for oral suspension: the first within 48 hours of birth and the second at 7 to 10 days of age. Cohort 2 neonates received daily dosing of ISENTRESS for oral suspension for 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through day 7 (week 1); 3 mg/kg twice daily on days 8 to 28 of age (weeks 2 to 4); and 6 mg/kg twice daily on days 29 to 42 of age (weeks 5 and 6). Sixteen neonates were enrolled in Cohort 1 (10 were exposed and 6 were unexposed to raltegravir in utero ) and 26 in Cohort 2 (all unexposed to raltegravir in utero ); all infants received a standard of care antiretroviral drug regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission. All enrolled neonates were followed for safety for a duration of 24 weeks. The 42 infants were 52% male, 69% Black and 12% Caucasian. HIV-1 status was assessed by nucleic acid test at birth, week 6 and week 24; all patients were HIV-1 negative at completion of the study. The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term neonates or in pediatric patients weighing less than 2 kg. ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS HD once daily has not been studied in pediatric patients. However population PK modeling and simulation support the use of 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS/ISENTRESS HD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS is necessary for patients with mild to moderate (Child-Pugh A and B) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD and therefore administration in subjects with hepatic impairment is not recommended. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown; therefore, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV-1 antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1.66 log 10 copies/mL by day 10. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 1.33 times the maximum approved recommended dose (and peak concentrations 1.25-fold higher than the maximum approved dose), raltegravir does not prolong the QT interval or PR interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir, given 400 mg twice daily, is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects. Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median T max of ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state. Raltegravir increases dose proportionally (AUC and C max ) or slightly less than dose proportionally (C 12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation, the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability. Steady-state is generally reached in 2 days, with little to no accumulation with multiple-dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 12. Table 12: Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Formulations PK parameter ratio (fed/fasted) Formulation Meal Type AUC Ratio (90% CI) C max Ratio (90% CI) C min Ratio (90% CI) Low fat meal: 300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat Moderate fat meal: 600 Kcal, 21 g fat High fat meal: 825 Kcal, 52 g fat 400 mg twice daily Low Fat 0.54 (0.41-0.71) 0.48 (0.35-0.67) 0.86 (0.54-1.36) Moderate Fat 1.13 (0.85-1.49) 1.05 (0.75-1.46) 1.66 (1.04-2.64) High Fat 2.11 (1.60-2.80) 1.96 (1.41-2.73) 4.13 (2.60-6.57) 1200 mg once daily Low Fat 0.58 (0.46-0.74) 0.48 (0.37-0.62) 0.84 (0.63-1.10) High Fat 1.02 (0.86-1.21) 0.72 (0.58-0.90) 0.88 (0.66-1.18) Chewable tablet High Fat 0.94 (0.78-1.14) 0.38 (0.28-0.52) 2.88 (2.21-3.75) Oral suspension The effect of food on oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 14, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age. Table 15 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates receiving the granules for oral suspension at the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK. Age/Race/Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age (18 years and older), race, or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe (24-hour creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown. Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A. In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Raltegravir drug interaction study results are shown in Tables 16 and 17. For information regarding clinical recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). No antagonism was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q, T97A, and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir treatment-failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. By Week 96 in the ONCEMRK trial, primary raltegravir resistance substitutions were observed in on treatment isolates obtained from 4 (3 with N155H and 1 with E92Q) of 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data in the 1200 mg QD arm and 2 (1 with N155H and 1 with T97A) of 6 virologic failure subjects in the 400 mg BID arm. Additional integrase substitutions observed included L74M, Q95K, V151I, E170A, I203M and D232N. These resistant isolates exhibited 6.2- to 19-fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir. Overall, at Week 96, detection of raltegravir resistance was not different between the QD and BID arms in subjects who were failing treatment and had resistance data evaluable (28.6% versus 33.3%, respectively). Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09). In the neonatal study IMPAACT P1110, there was no association between apparent clearance (CL/F) of raltegravir and UGT1A1 genotype polymorphisms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir, given 400 mg twice daily, is absorbed with a T max of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects. Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median T max of ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state. Raltegravir increases dose proportionally (AUC and C max ) or slightly less than dose proportionally (C 12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established. The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film-coated tablet. Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation, the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability. Steady-state is generally reached in 2 days, with little to no accumulation with multiple-dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 12. Table 12: Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Formulations PK parameter ratio (fed/fasted) Formulation Meal Type AUC Ratio (90% CI) C max Ratio (90% CI) C min Ratio (90% CI) Low fat meal: 300 Kcal, 2.5 g fat Moderate fat meal: 600 Kcal, 21 g fat High fat meal: 825 Kcal, 52 g fat 400 mg twice daily Low Fat 0.54 (0.41-0.71) 0.48 (0.35-0.67) 0.86 (0.54-1.36) Moderate Fat 1.13 (0.85-1.49) 1.05 (0.75-1.46) 1.66 (1.04-2.64) High Fat 2.11 (1.60-2.80) 1.96 (1.41-2.73) 4.13 (2.60-6.57) 1200 mg once daily Low Fat 0.58 (0.46-0.74) 0.48 (0.37-0.62) 0.84 (0.63-1.10) High Fat 1.02 (0.86-1.21) 0.72 (0.58-0.90) 0.88 (0.66-1.18) Chewable tablet High Fat 0.94 (0.78-1.14) 0.38 (0.28-0.52) 2.88 (2.21-3.75) Oral suspension The effect of food on oral suspension was not studied. Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83% bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 \u00b5M. In one study of HIV-1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5.8% (range 1 to 53.5%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This median proportion was approximately 3-fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23% of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70% of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability, thus higher AUC, compared to the 400 mg tablet. In the same study, the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet. These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg/kg/dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension. As displayed in Table 14, the doses recommended for HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily. Overall, dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures (C trough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects, but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed. Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations (113 nM) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation (233 nM) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . As a result, the 400 mg film-coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg; however, the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In addition, pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations (82 nM) compared to all other pediatric subgroups.

UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age. Table 15 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates receiving the granules for oral suspension at the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK. Age/Race/Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age (18 years and older), race, or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied. Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination. The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe (24-hour creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily. The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown. Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit (IC 50 >100 \u00b5M) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A. In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Similarly, raltegravir is not an inhibitor (IC 50 >50 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, and raltegravir does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 \u00b1 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC 95 ) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC 95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC 50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC 95 value = 6 nM). No antagonism was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV-1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance (evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 (changed to C, H, or R) or Q148 (changed to H, K, or R) or N155 (changed to H) plus one or more additional substitutions (i.e., L74M, E92Q, Q95K/R, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R, and D232N). E92Q, T97A, and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143, Q148, or N155 in raltegravir treatment-failure subjects. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Subjects: By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial, the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in 4 (2 with Y143H/R and 2 with Q148H/R) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. By Week 96 in the ONCEMRK trial, primary raltegravir resistance substitutions were observed in on treatment isolates obtained from 4 (3 with N155H and 1 with E92Q) of 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data in the 1200 mg QD arm and 2 (1 with N155H and 1 with T97A) of 6 virologic failure subjects in the 400 mg BID arm. Additional integrase substitutions observed included L74M, Q95K, V151I, E170A, I203M and D232N. These resistant isolates exhibited 6.2- to 19-fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir. Overall, at Week 96, detection of raltegravir resistance was not different between the QD and BID arms in subjects who were failing treatment and had resistance data evaluable (28.6% versus 33.3%, respectively). Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects: By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials, at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions, Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H, was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment-failure isolates. The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96, 15.2% and 17% of the raltegravir recipients, respectively. Some (n=58) of those HIV-1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26.3-fold (mean 48.9 \u00b1 44.8-fold decrease, ranging from 0.8- to 159-fold) compared to the wild-type reference. Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir. Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir."

      "12.5 Pharmacogenomics UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with *28/*28 genotype (associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1) to 27 adult subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09). In the neonatal study IMPAACT P1110, there was no association between apparent clearance (CL/F) of raltegravir and UGT1A1 genotype polymorphisms."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was 1.8-fold (females) or 1.2-fold (males) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. Treatment-related squamous cell carcinoma of nose/nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg/kg/day raltegravir for 104 weeks. These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and/or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during dosing. No tumors of the nose/nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (males) and 50 mg/kg/day (females) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1.7-fold (males) to 1.4-fold (females) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage, and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies. No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in a 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose."

No tumors of the nose/nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (males) and 50 mg/kg/day (females) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1.7-fold (males) to 1.4-fold (females) greater than the AUC (54 \u00b5M\u2219hr) at the 400-mg twice daily human dose. No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage, and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies. No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in a 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose."

Randomization was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u226450,000 copies/mL; or >50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis status. In STARTMRK, 563 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There were 563 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 37 years (range: 19-71), 19% female, 58% non-white, 6% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 20% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 53% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 47% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm 3 ; the frequencies of these baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. ONCEMRK (ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [2 \u00d7 600 mg] once daily) ONCEMRK is a Phase 3 randomized, international, double-blind, active-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily versus ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1-infected subjects with HIV-1 RNA \u22651000 copies/mL. Randomization was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level (\u2264100,000 or >100,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B and C infection status. In ONCEMRK, 797 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either raltegravir 1200 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There were 797 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 34 years (range: 18-84), 15% female, 41% non-white, 3% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 13% were CDC Class C (AIDS), 28% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies per mL, and 13% had CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells per mm 3 ; the frequencies of these baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Table 19 shows the virologic outcomes in both studies. Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up.

Consistent efficacy in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 \u00d7 600 mg) once daily was observed across HIV subtypes with 80.6% (270/335) and 83.5% (162/194) of subjects with B and non-B subtypes respectively, achieving HIV RNA <40 copies/mL at week 96 (Snapshot approach). 14.3 Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are Phase 3 studies to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with an optimized background therapy (OBT), versus OBT alone, in HIV-1-infected subjects, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NNRTIs, NRTIs, PIs) of antiretroviral therapies. Randomization was stratified by degree of resistance to PI (1PI vs. >1PI) and the use of enfuvirtide in the OBT. Prior to randomization, OBT was selected by the investigator based on genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing and prior ART history.

The primary virology endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL at Week 24 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -12% for each study; and the frequency of adverse events up to 24 weeks. Subjects with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they each failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of switching to ISENTRESS versus continuing on lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In the combined analysis of these studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 82.3% of the ISENTRESS group versus 90.3% of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group. Clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment groups. 14.4 Pediatric Subjects 2 to 18 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open-label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment-experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Subjects were stratified by age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Subjects were enrolled into cohorts according to age and received the following formulations: Cohort I (12 to less than 18 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIa (6 to less than 12 years old), 400 mg film-coated tablet; Cohort IIb (6 to less than 12 years old), chewable tablet; Cohort III (2 to less than 6 years), chewable tablet. Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen. The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional subjects were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 subjects, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . These 96 subjects had a median age of 13 (range: 2 to 18) years, were 51% female, 34% Caucasian, and 59% Black. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log 10 copies/mL, median CD4 cell count was 481 cells/mm 3 (range: 0 \u2013 2361) and median CD4% was 23.3% (range: 0 \u2013 44). Overall, 8% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and 59% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. Most subjects had previously used at least one NNRTI (78%) or one PI (83%). Ninety-three (97%) subjects 2 to 18 years of age completed 24 weeks of treatment (3 discontinued due to non-compliance). At Week 24, 54% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL; 66% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 119 cells/mm 3 (3.8%). 4 Weeks to Less Than 2 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age (Cohorts IV and V) who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as an oral suspension without regard to food in combination with an optimized background regimen. The 26 subjects had a median age of 28 weeks (range: 4 -100), were 35% female, 85% Black and 8% Caucasian. At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.7 log 10 copies/mL (range: 3.1 \u2013 7), median CD4 cell count was 1400 cells/mm 3 (range: 131 \u2013 3648) and median CD4% was 18.6% (range: 3.3 \u2013 39.3). Overall, 69% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA exceeding 100,000 copies/mL and 23% had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C. None of the 26 subjects were completely treatment-na\u00efve. All infants under 6 months of age had received nevirapine or zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-infant transmission, and 43% of subjects greater than 6 months of age had received two or more antiretrovirals. Of the 26 treated subjects, 23 subjects were included in the Week 24 and 48 efficacy analyses, respectively. All 26 treated subjects were included for safety analyses. At Week 24, 39% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 500 cells/mm 3 (7.5%). At Week 48, 44% achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL and 61% achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 492 cells/mm 3 (7.8%)."

      "Bring this booklet to your child's appointments. ISENTRESS (raltegravir) for oral suspension Instructions for Use for babies and toddlers Before You Start Note: Make sure your doctor shows you how to prepare and give ISENTRESS for oral suspension. \u2022 Be sure you understand these instructions before you start. Call your doctor if you have any questions. \u2022 It is very important that you measure the water and ISENTRESS carefully using the correct syringe. \u2022 Before you give ISENTRESS to your child, check the expiration date. The expiration date is printed on the box and the ISENTRESS packets. \u2022 Do not open the ISENTRESS packets until you are ready to mix a dose. \u2022 The amount of ISENTRESS depends on your child's age and weight, so it will change over time. Your doctor will tell you the right dose at each check-up after weighing your child. Be sure to keep your doctor's appointments so you get new dosing information as your child grows. During your child's first week of life, you will give ISENTRESS 1 time a day. After the first week of life, you will give it 2 times a day. \u2022 This booklet tells you how to: o Mix ISENTRESS into a liquid form o Measure the right dose using a syringe o Give mixed ISENTRESS to your child o Clean up Kit Contents \u2022 Prescription (on box) \u2022 2 mixing cups \u2022 Instructions for Use (this booklet) \u2022 Prescribing Information \u2022 6 syringes \u2022 60 packets of ISENTRESS 2 blue (10mL) syringes 2 green (3mL) syringes 2 white (1mL) syringes The kit has an extra cup and set of syringes in case one is lost or damaged. Do not use any damaged cups or syringes. Step 1. Get ready \u2022 Put your child in a safe place. You will need both hands to prepare ISENTRESS. \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Take out what you need from the kit as shown below to make 1 dose and place on a clean surface: 1 mixing cup (Using the tab on the mixing cup, pull open the lid) 1 packet of ISENTRESS a clean glass 3 syringes (Have one of each size ready, but you will only need 1 or 2, depending on the prescribed dose) Step 2. Fill a clean glass with water Fill a clean glass with room-temperature drinking water from your sink or use bottled water. Step 3. Fill the blue syringe with water Push the plunger of the blue syringe into the syringe as far as it goes. Put the tip of the syringe into the glass of water. Pull back the plunger to draw up water into the syringe. Stop when you get to the 10mL mark. Step 4. Check for air bubbles Hold the syringe with tip up. Tap it with your finger to move any air bubbles up towards the tip. Slowly push up on the plunger to make the air come out. You may see some drops of water come out. Re-check the amount of water in the syringe. If it is less than 10mL, put the tip back into the water and pull back on the plunger until you get to the 10mL mark. Step 5. Add the 10mL of water to the mixing cup Add the 10 mL of water from the syringe to the mixing cup by pushing all the way down on the plunger. Step 6. Add ISENTRESS to the mixing cup Note before adding ISENTRESS: Make sure you and your child are ready! After mixing ISENTRESS, use it within 30 minutes . Throw away any leftover ISENTRESS after you have given the dose to your child. Take 1 packet of ISENTRESS and shake the powder to the bottom of the packet. Tear or cut open the packet at the dotted line and add all of the powder to the water in the mixing cup. Make sure the packet is completely empty. Step 7. Mix ISENTRESS and water Snap the lid of the mixing cup shut. Gently swirl the mixing cup for 45 seconds in a circular motion to mix the powder and water. Use a clock or timer to time for 45 seconds. Do not shake the mixture. Check to make sure the powder is mixed. If it is not mixed, swirl it some more. The mixture should look cloudy. Step 8. Check your prescription Find the dose amount in 'mL' prescribed by your doctor. This is written on the prescription label on the box from your pharmacy. Remember that the dose may change each time you go to the doctor, so make sure you check the prescribed dose each time. Be sure to go to all of your doctor's appointments so your child gets the right dose! Step 9. Choose the syringe you need Your doctor will prescribe the dose in milliliters (mL). Choose the right syringe for your child's dose: WHITE (1mL) for 1mL or less GREEN (3mL) for 1.5mL to 3mL BLUE (10mL) for 3.5mL to 10mL Then find the mL mark on the syringe that matches your child's dose. Step 10. Measure ISENTRESS Push the plunger into the barrel of the syringe as far as it goes. Put the tip of the syringe into the cup of the mixed ISENTRESS and pull back on the plunger. Stop when you get to the line that matches your child's prescribed dose. IMPORTANT: \u2022 Your child's dose may be different from the one shown in this figure. \u2022 There will usually be some leftover mixed ISENTRESS in the mixing cup. Step 11. Check for air bubbles Hold the syringe with tip up. Tap it with your finger to move any air bubbles up towards the tip. Slowly push the plunger to make the air come out. You may see some drops of medicine come out. Re-check the amount of ISENTRESS in the syringe. If it is less than the prescribed dose, put the tip back into the cup of mixed ISENTRESS and pull back on the plunger until you get to the right dose mark. Step 12. Give ISENTRESS to your child Place the tip of the syringe inside your child's mouth so that it touches either the right or left cheek. Slowly push in the plunger to give the dose of mixed ISENTRESS to your child. If your child fusses, take the tip of the syringe out of the mouth and try again. It is important that your child takes all of the prescribed dose (a little left in the syringe tip is OK). IMPORTANT: If your child does not take all of the prescribed dose or spits some of it out, call your doctor to find out what to do. Step 13. Clean up Pour the leftover mixed ISENTRESS into the trash. Do not pour it into the sink. Pull the plungers out of any syringes you used. Hand wash the syringes, plungers, and mixing cup with warm water and dish soap. Do not wash in the dishwasher. Rinse with water and let air dry. Put everything in a clean, dry place. How should I store ISENTRESS? Store the ISENTRESS for oral suspension kit at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Store in the original container. Keep ISENTRESS and all medicines out of the reach of children. Be sure to keep your doctor's appointments so you always know how much ISENTRESS to give to your child. For more information, go to www.ISENTRESS.com or call 1-800-622-4477.
