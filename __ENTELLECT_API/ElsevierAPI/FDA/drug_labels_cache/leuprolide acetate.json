    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate injection can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving Leurpolide acetate injection; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [See ADVERSE REACTIONS ]. Monitor Patients for the Development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt Leuprolide acetate injection, until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue Leuprolide acetate injection."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug\u2019s vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data ). Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population.",

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. What is leuprolide acetate injection? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH- RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. Directions for Using Leuprolide Acetate Injection Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate bottle. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician.

Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary Apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other leuprolide acetate for depot suspension and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Leuprolide Acetate Injection (LOO proe lide in\u02c8jekSH(\u04d9)n) Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection: 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 1/2 ml syringe with a 28 gauge, \u00bd inch sterile needle attached (See Figure A) 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201cDisposal of used syringes, needles, and vials\u201d) Preparing the leuprolide acetate injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Giving leuprolide acetate injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population."

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate bottle. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. Brands listed are the trademarks of their respective owners.

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded. * Physiologic effect of decreased testosterone.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse events were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Rash, urticaria, and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively.

Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other LUPRON DEPOT and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE LEUPROLIDE (loo-PROE-lide) ACETATE INJECTION Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the Leuprolide Acetate Injection: 1 vial of Leuprolide Acetate Injection a sterile 0.5 mL syringe (See Figure A ) 1 cotton gauze 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201c Disposal of used syringes, needles, and vials \u201d) Figure A Preparing the Leuprolide Acetate Injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B ) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C ). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D ). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E ). Figure E Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F ). Do not touch the needle. Figure F Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G ). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H ). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I ). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving Leuprolide Acetate Injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J ). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K ). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L ). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Due to different release characteristics, the dosage strengths are not additive and must be selected based upon the desired dosing schedule ( 2 ). LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3 months administration, given as a single intramuscular injection every 12 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-Month Administration LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION must be administered under the supervision of a physician. In patients treated with GnRH analogues for prostate cancer, treatment is usually continued upon development of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Table 1. LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION Recommended Dosing Dosage 22.5 mg for 3-Month Administration Recommended Dose 1 injection every 12 weeks The recommended dose of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-month administration is one injection every 12 weeks. Do not use concurrently a fractional dose, or a combination of doses of this or any depot formulation due to different release characteristics. Incorporated in a depot formulation, the lyophilized microspheres must be reconstituted and administered every 12 weeks as a single intramuscular injection. 2.2 Reconstitution Instructions for LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION Reconstitute and administer the lyophilized microspheres as a single intramuscular injection. The suspension should be administered immediately after reconstitution. As with other drugs administered by intramuscular injection, the injection site should be alternated periodically. Visually inspect LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION powder (white to off-white powder). DO NOT USE the vial if clumping or caking is evident. A thin layer of powder on the wall of the vial is considered normal prior to mixing with the diluent. The diluent contained in the prefilled syringe should appear clear and colorless. Use ONLY the provided diluent for reconstitution of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION. DO NOT use other diluents. The reconstituted product is a suspension of milky, white color appearance. LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION is packaged in a commercial kit. Each kit contains: One vial containing 22.5 mg of leuprolide acetate as lyophilized microspheres. One prefilled syringe containing 2 mL of mannitol for injection. One MIXJECT transfer device including one needle. Please read the instructions completely before you begin. MIXJECT Preparation Wash your hands with soap and hot water and put on gloves 1 immediately prior to preparing the injection. Place the tray on a clean, flat surface that is covered with a sterile pad or cloth. Remove the MIXJECT device, the backstop, the prefilled syringe containing the solvent for reconstitution and the LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION vial. Remove the Flip-Off button from the top of the vial, revealing the rubber stopper. Place the vial in a standing upright position on the prepared surface. Disinfect the rubber stopper with the alcohol wipe. Discard the alcohol wipe and allow the stopper to dry. Insert the backstop to the flange of the syringe until you feel it snap in place . Proceed to MIXJECT Activation. MIXJECT Activation Peel the cover away from the blister pack containing the vial adapter (MIXJECT). Do not remove the vial adapter from the blister pack. Place the blister pack containing the vial adapter firmly on the vial top, piercing the vial. Push down gently until you feel it snap in place. Remove the cap from the syringe barrel and then, remove the blister pack from the vial adapter . Connect the syringe to the vial adapter by screwing it clockwise into the opening on the side of the vial adapter. Be sure to gently twist the syringe until it stops turning to ensure a tight connection. While holding the vial, place your thumb on the plunger rod and push the plunger rod in all the way to transfer the diluent from the pre-filled syringe into the vial. Do not release the plunger rod. Keeping the plunger rod depressed, gently swirl the vial for approximately one minute until a uniform milky-white suspension is obtained . This will ensure complete mixing of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION and the sterile mannitol solution diluent. The suspension will now have a milky appearance. In order to avoid separation of the suspension, proceed to the next steps without delay. Invert the MIXJECT system so that the vial is at the top. Grasp the MIXJECT system firmly by the syringe and pull back the plunger rod slowly to draw the reconstituted LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION into the syringe. Return the vial to its upright position, and disconnect the vial adapter from the MIXJECT syringe assembly by grabbing firmly the syringe and turning the plastic cap of the vial adapter clockwise. Grasp only the plastic cap when removing . Keep the syringe UPRIGHT. With the opposite hand pull the needle cap upward. Advance the plunger to expel the air from the syringe. The syringe containing LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION is now ready for administration. The suspension should be administered immediately after reconstitution. After cleaning the injection site with an alcohol swab, administer the intramuscular injection by inserting the needle at a 90 degree angle into the gluteal area, anterior thigh, or deltoid; injection sites should be alternated (see Figure). NOTE: If a blood vessel is accidentally penetrated, aspirated blood will be visible just below the luer lock. If blood is present, remove the needle immediately. Do not inject the medication. Inject the entire contents of the syringe intramuscularly. Withdraw the needle. Once the syringe has been withdrawn, immediately discard the needle into a suitable sharps container. Dispose the syringe according to local regulations/procedures. fig 1.jpg fig 2.jpg Fig 3.jpg fig 4.jpg fig 5.jpg ifig 6.jpg fig 7.jpg fig 8.jpg fig 9.jpg fig 10.jpg"

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tumor Flare: Increased serum testosterone (~50% above baseline) during first week of treatment; monitor serum testosterone and PSA. ( 5.6 ) Isolated cases of transient worsening of symptoms, or additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer during the first few weeks of treatment. ( 5.1 ) A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain which can be managed symptomatically. ( 5.1 ) Isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been reported with GnRH agonists, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. ( 5.1 ) Metabolic Syndrome: The use of GnRH agonists may lead to an increased risk of metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Monitor for signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome including lipids, blood glucose level and/or HbA1c and manage according to current treatment guidelines. ( 5.2 ) Cardiovascular Diseases: Increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH analogs in men. Monitor for cardiovascular disease and manage according to current clinical practice. ( 5.3 ) Effect on QT/QTc Interval: Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong QT interval. Consider risks and benefits ( 5.4 ) Convulsions have been observed in patients with or without a history of predisposing factors. Manage convulsions according to the current clinical practice. ( 5.5 ) Monitor serum levels of testosterone following injection of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-month administration. ( 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION may cause fetal harm. ( 5.7 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Tumor Flare Initially, LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION, like other GnRH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone to approximately 50% above baseline during the first weeks of treatment. Isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Transient worsening of symptoms may develop. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy. 5.2 Metabolic Syndrome The use of GnRH agonists may lead to metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including cirrhosis, occurred in the post-marketing setting. Hyperglycemia may represent new-onset diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with pre-existing diabetes. Monitor for changes in serum lipids, blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients receiving a GnRH agonist, and manage according to current treatment guidelines. 5.3 Cardiovascular Diseases Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. 5.4 Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. 5.5 Convulsions Postmarketing reports of convulsions have been observed in patients on leuprolide acetate therapy. These included patients with a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and in patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions such as bupropion and SSRIs. Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of any of the conditions mentioned above. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist who experience convulsion should be managed according to current clinical practice. 5.6 Laboratory Tests Monitor serum levels of testosterone following injection of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-month administration. In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, and then declined thereafter to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) within four weeks. [ see Clinical Studies (14) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies, LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

ADVERSE REACTIONS The following is discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Tumor Flare [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Metabolic Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Cardiovascular Disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Effect on QT/QTc Interval [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Convulsions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) are hot flushes, upper respiratory infection, fatigue, diarrhea, pollakiuria, arthralgia, and injection site pain ( 6 ). As with other GnRH agonist, other adverse reactions, including decreased bone density and rare cases of pituitary apoplexy may occur.

LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-Month Administration In a clinical trial of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-month administration, patients were treated for 24 weeks with 157/163 receiving two injections. The table includes adverse reactions were reported in 5% or more of the patients during the treatment period as well as the incidence of these adverse reaction that were considered, by the treating physician, to be at least possibly related to LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions reported as treatment-emergent in 13% of patients and treatment-related 4% of patients. CCTCAE v.3 1 Includes cold sweat, flushing, hot flush, hyperhidrosis, and night sweats 2 Includes influenza, influenza-like illness, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, upper respiratory tract infection and congestion Table 2.

Laboratory abnormalities During the treatment period, at least a one grade change in laboratory values was seen (>10%) in the following: anemia, increased triglyceride, hyperglycemia, increased cholesterol, increased creatine kinase, leukopenia, increased AST, increased creatinine, and increased ALT. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Mood swings, including depression, have been reported. There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation and attempt. Many, but not all, of these patients had a history of depression or other psychiatric illness. Patients should be counseled on the possibility of development or worsening of depression during treatment with LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Rash, urticaria, and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported. Pituitary apoplexy: During postmarketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with a GnRH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide acetate-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Immune Disorders: Anaphylaxis Psychiatric Disorders: Depression Cardiovascular System - hypotension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorder - Pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease Hepato-biliary disorder - serious drug-induced liver injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Blood and Lymphatic System - decreased WBC Central/Peripheral Nervous System - convulsion, peripheral neuropathy, spinal fracture/paralysis Endocrine System - diabetes mellitus Musculoskeletal System - tenosynovitis-like symptoms Urogenital System - prostate pain"

There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy at doses of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/1600 to 1/16 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose (0.024 mg/kg) in rats. 8.2. Lactation The safety and efficacy of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.3.

    "description": [
      "11. DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt) with the following structural formula: Where: n=1 or 2 Leuprolide acetate has a molecular weight of 1209.41 as free base\u201d. Leuprolide is freely soluble in water. LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-month administration is available in a vial containing white to off white sterile lyophilized microspheres together with the corresponding sterile reconstitution diluent in a pre-filled syringe. When LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION and the diluent are mixed together they become a suspension intended as an intramuscular injection to be given ONCE EVERY 12 WEEKS as a single dose. Each vial of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg for 3-month administration delivers leuprolide acetate (22.5 mg), polylactic acid (188.4 mg), triethylcitrate (10.4 mg), polysorbate 80 (3.8 mg), mannitol (88.4 mg) and carmellose sodium (25 mg). The prefilled syringe containing the clear reconstitution diluent (2 mL) contains mannitol (16 mg), water for injections, and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid to control pH. Leuprolide acetate for depot suspension is an extended release sterile, single dose injection in suspension form for intramuscular administration. fig 11"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostate tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In humans, administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females). However, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to below castrate threshold. In premenopausal females, estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal concentrations. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment. Long-term studies have shown that continuation of therapy with leuprolide acetate maintains testosterone below the castrate level for more than five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following two sequential injections of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg administered with a 3-month interval, plasma leuprolide concentrations were similar among both cycles. After first administration, mean plasma leuprolide concentration of 46.8 ng/mL was observed at approximately 2 hours and the mean concentration then declined until next injection. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Elimination The mean systemic clearance of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 7.6 L/h, and terminal elimination half-life was approximately 3 hours based on a two-compartment model. Upon administration with different leuprolide acetate formulations, the major metabolite of leuprolide acetate is a pentapeptide (M- 1) metabolite."

In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no leuprolide acetate-induced tumors or pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years.

Patients were administered LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 22.5 mg intramuscularly in 2 doses (157 received 2 injections) with a 3-month interval. The median age was 71 years (range; 47-91), 62% White, and 30% Black or African-American. Castrate levels of serum testosterone (<50 ng/dL) were achieved and maintained from Day 28 to 168 in 94.3% (95% CI:89.4, 97.0) of patients. On Day 28, 160 of the 162 (98.8%) patients had castrate testosterone levels. One patient did not achieve a castrate level and one had a missing value. Testosterone escapes (any value > 50 ng/dL after castrate levels were achieved) occurred in four patients. In addition, three patients had a single unevaluable testosterone level after Day 28 that was considered to be non-castrate in this analysis. Figure 1.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH). The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt) with the following structural formula: Leuprolide acetate injection is a sterile, aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous injection. It is available in a 2.8 mL multiple-dose vial containing leuprolide acetate (5 mg/mL), sodium chloride, USP (6.3 mg/mL) for tonicity adjustment, benzyl alcohol, NF as a preservative (9 mg/mL), and water for injection, USP. The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide, NF and/or acetic acid, NF. The pH range is 4.0 to 6.0. Leuprolide_Injection_Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions]. Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data). Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment.

Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other LUPRON DEPOT and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations.

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION 1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. 3. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 4. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate bottle. 5. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. 6. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 7. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. 8. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 9. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. 10. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. 11. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. 12. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. 13. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. 14. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. 15. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE LEUPROLIDE (loo-PROE-lide) ACETATE INJECTION Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the Leuprolide Acetate Injection: 1 vial of Leuprolide Acetate Injection a sterile 0.5 mL syringe (see Figure A) 1 cotton gauze 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201cDisposal of used syringes, needles, and vials\u201d) Figure A Preparing the Leuprolide Acetate Injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (see Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Figure E Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Figure F Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving Leuprolide Acetate Injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT \u00ae 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT \u00ae 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Leuprolide acetate injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogs or any of the excipients in leuprolide acetate injection: Reports of anaphylactic reactions to GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the medical literature."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate injection, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate injection treatment. Patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions]. Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide injection may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate injection have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate injection, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate injection in this population."

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION ? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate injection must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. When using a new vial of leuprolide acetate injection, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use. DO NOT USE if the liquid is not clear or has particles and replace with a new vial. Remove needle cap and inject the needle in the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate injection left in the vial will be small. Take special care to hold the vial straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the vial and the vial upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the vial. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different injection site. Choose an injection site. Cleanse the injection site with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, inject the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the vial straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the vial. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. Brands listed are the trademarks of their respective owners. Manufactured by Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). Cases of temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction have occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

General disorders and administration site conditions \u2013 injection site reactions including induration, abscess and necrosis. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other LUPRON DEPOT \u00ae and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Leuprolide Acetate (loo' proe lide as' e tate) Injection Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection: 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 1/2 mL syringe with a 28 gauge, 1/2 inch sterile needle attached (See Figure A) 1 cotton gauze 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \"Disposal of used syringes and vials\") Figure A Preparing the leuprolide acetate injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the vial. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Figure E Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Figure F Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Inject the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving leuprolide acetate injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Inject the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used syringes and vial Step 11. Put the used syringes and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose syringes or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used syringes and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

Reports of anaphylactic reactions to GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the medical literature."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate injection, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate injection treatment. Patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide acetate injection may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024 mg/kg, 0.24 mg/kg, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024 mg/kg, 0.0024 mg/kg, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate injection have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate injection in this population."

Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats."

    "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": [
      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide acetate injection may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024 mg/kg, 0.24 mg/kg, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). Cases of temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction have occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required.

    "information_for_patients": [
      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate injection must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION 1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. When using a new vial of leuprolide acetate injection flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use. DO NOT USE if the liquid is not clear or has particles and replace with a new vial. 3. Remove needle cap and inject the needle in the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. 4. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. 5. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. 6. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 7. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate injection left in the vial will be small. Take special care to hold the vial straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. 8. Keeping the needle in the vial and the vial upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the vial. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 9. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. 10. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different injection site. 11. Choose an injection site. Cleanse the injection site with another alcohol wipe. 12. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. 13. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, inject the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. 14. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. 15. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate injection, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the vial straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the vial. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children.

If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving Leuprolide Acetate Injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Inject the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (see Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (see Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (see Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension, 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur. CLINICAL STUDIES In a controlled study comparing leuprolide acetate, 1 mg/day given subcutaneously to DES (diethylstilbestrol), 3 mg/day, the survival rate for the two groups was comparable after two years of treatment. The objective response to treatment was also similar for the two groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions ] . Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population."

      "Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section.",
      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate injection must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate injection is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Open the needle and push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection bottle. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate injection left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate injection, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children."

In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse events were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively. Cardiovascular System - Hypotension, Myocardial infarction, Pulmonary embolism; Endocrine System - Diabetes; Gastrointestinal System - Hepatic dysfunction; Hepato-biliary disorder \u2013 Serious drug-induced liver injury; Hemic and Lymphatic System - Decreased WBC; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, Urticaria, Photosensitivity, Hair growth, SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, Dermatitis exfoliative, Bullous dermatitis, Erythema multiforme; Central/Peripheral Nervous System - Convulsion, Peripheral neuropathy, Spinal fracture/paralysis, Hearing disorder; Miscellaneous - Hard nodule in throat, Weight gain, Increased uric acid; Musculoskeletal System - Tenosynovitis-like symptoms; Respiratory System - Respiratory disorders, Interstitial lung disease; Urogenital System \u2013 Prostate pain. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required.

      "Instructions For Use Leuprolide (LOO proe lide) Acetate Injection Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection: 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 0.5 mL syringe (See Figure A) with fixed 28 gauge 1/2 inch needle 1 cotton gauze 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201cDisposal of used syringes, needles, and vials\u201d) Figure A Preparing the leuprolide acetate injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Figure E Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Figure F Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving leuprolide acetate injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT \u00ae 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate injection, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate injection treatment. Patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions]. Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide injection may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate injection have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate injection, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate injection in this population."

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION ? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate injection must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. When using a new vial of leuprolide acetate injection, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use. DO NOT USE if the liquid is not clear or has particles and replace with a new vial. Remove needle cap and inject the needle in the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate injection left in the vial will be small. Take special care to hold the vial straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the vial and the vial upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the vial. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different injection site. Choose an injection site. Cleanse the injection site with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, inject the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the vial straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the vial. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. Brands listed are the trademarks of their respective owners. Manufactured by Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Ahmedabad, India Rev.: 10/25"

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). Cases of temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction have occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse reactions were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively.

General disorders and administration site conditions \u2013 injection site reactions including induration, abscess and necrosis. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other LUPRON DEPOT \u00ae and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Leuprolide Acetate (loo' proe lide as' e tate) Injection Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection: 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 1/2 mL syringe with a 28 gauge, 1/2 inch sterile needle attached (See Figure A) 1 cotton gauze 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \"Disposal of used syringes and vials\") Figure A Preparing the leuprolide acetate injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the vial. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Figure E Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Figure F Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Inject the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving leuprolide acetate injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Inject the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used syringes and vial Step 11. Put the used syringes and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose syringes or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container.

      "DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH). The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt) with the following structural formula: Leuprolide acetate injection is a sterile, aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous injection. It is available in a 2.8 mL multiple-dose vial containing leuprolide acetate (5 mg/mL), sodium chloride, USP (6.3 mg/mL) for tonicity adjustment, benzyl alcohol, NF as a preservative (9 mg/mL), and water for injection, USP. The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide, NF and/or acetic acid, NF. The pH range is 4.0 to 6.0. Leuprolide Acetate Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate injection, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. Patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug\u2019s vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide acetate injection may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data ). Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate injection have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate injection, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, Leuprolide acetate injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of leuprolide acetate injection in this population."

Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate injection have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate injection, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, Leuprolide acetate injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). Cases of temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction have occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse reactions were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively.

In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary Apoplexy During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required.

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. What is leuprolide acetate injection? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate injection must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. Directions for Using Leuprolide Acetate Injection 1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. When using a new vial of leuprolide acetate injection, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use. DO NOT USE if the liquid is not clear or has particles and replace with a new vial. 3. Remove needle cap and inject the needle in the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. 4. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection vial. 5. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. 6. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 7. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate injection left in the vial will be small. Take special care to hold the vial straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. 8. Keeping the needle in the vial and the vial upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the vial. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 9. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. 10. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different injection site. 11. Choose an injection site. Cleanse the injection site with another alcohol wipe. 12. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. 13. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, inject the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. 14. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. 15. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. Some Special Advice \u2022 You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. \u2022 You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. \u2022 If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. \u2022 Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. \u2022 If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. \u2022 When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the vial straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. \u2022 Do not try to get every last drop out of the vial. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. \u2022 Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. \u2022 Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. \u2022 Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. \u2022 Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH). The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt) with the following structural formula: Leuprolide acetate injection is a sterile, aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous injection. It is available in a 2.8 mL multiple-dose vial containing leuprolide acetate, USP (5 mg/mL), sodium chloride, USP (6.3 mg/mL) for tonicity adjustment, benzyl alcohol, NF as a preservative (9 mg/mL), and water for injection, USP. The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide, NF and/or glacial acetic acid, USP. The pH range is 4.5 to 6.5. leuprolide-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT* 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate injection, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate injection treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate injection can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate injection; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions ]. Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate injection until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate injection."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024 mg/kg, 0.24 mg/kg, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024 mg/kg, 0.0024 mg/kg, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate injection have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate injection, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate injection in this population."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse events were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively. Cardiovascular System - Hypotension, Myocardial infarction, Pulmonary embolism; Endocrine System \u2013 Diabetes; Gastrointestinal System - Hepatic dysfunction; Hepato-biliary disorder \u2013 Serious drug-induced liver injury; Hemic and Lymphatic System - Decreased WBC; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders - Rash, Urticaria, Photosensitivity, Hair growth, SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, Dermatitis exfoliative, Bullous dermatitis, Erythema multiforme; Central/Peripheral Nervous System - Convulsion, Peripheral neuropathy, Spinal fracture/paralysis, Hearing disorder; Miscellaneous - Hard nodule in throat, Weight gain, Increased uric acid; Musculoskeletal System - Tenosynovitis-like symptoms; Respiratory System - Respiratory disorders, Interstitial lung disease; Urogenital System \u2013 Prostate pain. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During postmarketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other LUPRON DEPOT* and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations."

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate injection must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate injection is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection bottle. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate injection left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate injection, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F); excursions permitted to 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. *The following is a registered trademark of its respective manufacturer: LUPRON DEPOT \u00ae /TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Leuprolide (LOO proe lide) Acetate Injection Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection : 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 0.5 mL syringe (See Figure A) with fixed 28 gauge, \u00bd inch needle 1 cotton gauze 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201cDisposal of used syringes, needles, and vials\u201d) Figure A Preparing the leuprolide acetate injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Figure E Step 5.

Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I) If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving leuprolide acetate injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Leuprolide acetate injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogs or any of the excipients in leuprolide acetate injection: Reports of anaphylactic reactions to GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the medical literature."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate injection can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving Leurpolide acetate injection; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [See ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Monitor Patients for the Development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt Leuprolide acetate injection, until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue Leuprolide acetate injection."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug\u2019s vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data ). Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population.",

      "Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section.",
      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. What is leuprolide acetate injection? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH- RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. Directions for Using Leuprolide Acetate Injection Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate bottle. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical TrialsIn the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (seeWARNINGSsection). In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases.Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction.In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician.

Changes in Bone Density : Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary Apoplexy : During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required.

Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection: 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 1/2 ml syringe with a 28 gauge, \u00bd inch sterile needle attached (See Figure A) 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201cDisposal of used syringes, needles, and vials\u201d) Preparing the leuprolide acetate injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Giving leuprolide acetate injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

      "DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH). The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt) with the following structural formula: Leuprolide acetate injection is a sterile, aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous injection. It is available in a 2.8 mL multiple-dose vial containing leuprolide acetate (5 mg/mL), sodium chloride, USP (6.3 mg/mL) for tonicity adjustment, benzyl alcohol, NF as a preservative (9 mg/mL), and water for injection, USP. The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide, NF and/or acetic acid, NF. The pH range is 4.0 to 6.0. chemical structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined. Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate. However, because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes as noted in specific studies, and the drug is only about 46% bound to plasma proteins, drug interactions would not be expected to occur."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions ] . Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). Cases of a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician.

Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse.

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION 1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. 3. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 4. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate bottle. 5. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. 6. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 7. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. 8. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. 9. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. 10. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. 11. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. 12. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. 13. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. 14. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. 15. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate injection, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. Manufactured by UBI Pharma Inc. No. 45, Guangfu N.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, acts as an inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion. Animal studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect was reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in pre-menopausal females). However, continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. In pre-menopausal females, estrogens are reduced to post-menopausal levels. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years. Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration. Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L. In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. Metabolism In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7.6 L/h, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model. In rats and dogs, administration of 14 C-labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, a pentapeptide (Metabolite I), tripeptides (Metabolites II and III) and a dipeptide (Metabolite IV). These fragments may be further catabolized. The major metabolite (M-I) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6% of the peak parent drug concentration. One week after dosing, mean plasma M-I concentrations were approximately 20% of mean leuprolide concentrations. Excretion Following administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension 3.75 mg to 3 patients, less than 5% of the dose was recovered as parent and M-I metabolite in the urine.

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Leuprolide acetate can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). SCARs, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and AGEP, occurred in patients receiving leuprolide acetate; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [ see Adverse Reactions ]. Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt leuprolide acetate until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue leuprolide acetate."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section. Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics section. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy (sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose (see data) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans). Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see WARNINGS section). In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse events were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively.

Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During postmarketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required.

There is no evidence at present that there is a clinical counterpart of this phenomenon. In early clinical trials with leuprolide acetate doses as high as 20 mg/day for up to two years caused no adverse effects differing from those observed with the 1 mg/day dose."

      "INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about leuprolide acetate injection and its use. WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION? Leuprolide acetate injection is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body. Normally, your body releases small amounts of LH-RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones. However, when you inject leuprolide acetate injection, the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes. Leuprolide acetate must be injected because, like insulin which is injected by diabetics, leuprolide acetate is inactive when taken by mouth. If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason, your body would begin making testosterone again. DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a new bottle for the first time, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use leuprolide acetate injection. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or has particles in it, DO NOT USE IT. Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container. Remove outer wrapping from one syringe. Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Take cover off needle. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the leuprolide acetate injection bottle. Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle. Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Toward the end of a two-week period, the amount of leuprolide acetate left in the bottle will be small. Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down, check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any, push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0.2 mL or 20 unit mark. Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles. To protect your skin, inject each daily dose at a different body spot. Choose an injection spot. Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe. Hold the syringe in one hand. Hold the skin taut, or pull up a little flesh with the other hand, as you were instructed. Holding the syringe as you would a pencil, thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90\u00b0 angle. Push the plunger to administer the injection. Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed. Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone. NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES, NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM. SOME SPECIAL ADVICE You may experience hot flashes when using leuprolide acetate injection. During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain, increased difficulty in urinating, and less commonly but most importantly, you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms. In any of these events, discuss the symptoms with your doctor. Like other treatment options, leuprolide acetate injection may cause impotence. Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning leuprolide acetate injection treatment. You may experience some irritation at the injection site, such as burning, itching or swelling. These reactions are usually mild and go away. If they do not, tell your doctor. If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like leuprolide acetate injection, you should not use this drug. Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better. You need an injection every day to make sure leuprolide acetate injection keeps working for you. If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with leuprolide acetate injection, low-dose insulin syringes should be utilized. When the drug level gets low, take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger. Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle. This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose. Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses. Tell your pharmacist when you will need leuprolide acetate injection so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it. Store below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place. Do not freeze. Protect from light; store vial in carton until use. Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. meitheal\u00ae Mfd. for Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Chicago, IL 60631 (USA) \u00a92025 Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Leuprolide Acetate (loo' proe lide as' e tate) Injection Read the Instructions for Use before you start using leuprolide acetate injection and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Your doctor should show you how to draw up leuprolide acetate injection and give the injection the right way before you inject the first time. Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Supplies you will need for the leuprolide acetate injection: 1 vial of leuprolide acetate injection a sterile 0.5 ml syringe (See Figure A) with an attached 28 gauge, \u00bd inch sterile needle 1 cotton gauze (not supplied in the kit) 2 alcohol swabs 1 puncture resistant sharps container (See \u201cDisposal of used syringes, needles, and vials\u201d) Figure A Preparing the L euprolide Acetate Injection Step 1. Wash hands thoroughly (See Figure B) and dry them with a clean towel. Figure B Step 2. Check the liquid in the container. It should look clear. Do not use if it is not clear or if it has particles in it. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper. Use an alcohol swab to clean the metal ring and the grey rubber stopper on the medicine vial every day, just before you use it (See Figure C). Figure C Step 3. Remove outer wrapping from 1 syringe (See Figure D). Figure D Step 4. Pull the syringe plunger back until the tip is at the proper mark for the prescribed dose (See Figure E). Figure E Step 5. Uncover needle by pulling the cap straight off (See Figure F). Do not touch the needle. Figure F Step 6. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the vial (See Figure G). Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the vial. Figure G Step 7. Keep the needle in the vial. Lift the vial and turn it straight upside down. Check to see that the needle tip is in the liquid (See Figure H). Figure H Step 8. With the needle tip still in the liquid, slowly pull back the plunger until syringe fills to the proper mark (See Figure I). If any bubbles appear in the syringe, remove them by pushing the plunger up slowly. Figure I Giving Leuprolide Acetate Injection Step 9. Choose a different injection site each day. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Hold the skin fold between your thumb and your index finger or as you were instructed by your doctor. Insert the needle straight into the skin quickly, as shown by your doctor in a 90\u00b0 angle (See Figure J). Push the plunger to inject the medicine. Figure J Step 10. Remove the needle at the same angle it was inserted (90\u00b0) (See Figure K). Wipe the skin with a cotton gauze. Figure K Disposal of used needles, syringes, and vials Step 11. Put the used needles, syringes, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.
