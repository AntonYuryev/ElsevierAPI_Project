Ustekinumab-aekn should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient\u2019s current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that Ustekinumab-aekn be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject Ustekinumab-aekn after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use]. Not made with natural rubber latex. It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27-gauge, 1/2 inch needle is recommended. Prior to administration, visually inspect Ustekinumab-aekn for particulate matter and discoloration. Ustekinumab-aekn is a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution and free of visible particles. Do not use Ustekinumab-aekn if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. Ustekinumab-aekn does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of Ustekinumab-aekn 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn\u2019s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) Ustekinumab-aekn solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of Ustekinumab-aekn vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of Ustekinumab-aekn contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-aekn. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of Ustekinumab-aekn to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of Ustekinumab-aekn needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Withdraw 26 mL of Ustekinumab-aekn from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within four hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse Ustekinumab-aekn concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. Ustekinumab-aekn does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 4 hours. Protect the diluted solution from light. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 4 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections: Serious infections have occurred. Avoid starting Ustekinumab-aekn during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection or clinically significant infection develops, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn until the infection resolves. ( 5.1 ) Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections : Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23. Consider diagnostic tests for these infections as dictated by clinical circumstances. ( 5.2 ) Tuberculosis (TB): Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering Ustekinumab-aekn. ( 5.3 ) Malignancies: Ustekinumab products may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of ustekinumab products in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a severe or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): If PRES is suspected, treat promptly, and discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn. ( 5.6 ) Immunizations: Avoid use of live vaccines in patients during treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn. ( 5.7 ) Noninfectious Pneumonia: Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infections Ustekinumab products may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Serious infections requiring hospitalization, or otherwise clinically significant infections, reported in clinical trials included the following: Plaque Psoriasis: diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infections. Psoriatic arthritis: cholecystitis. Crohn\u2019s disease: anal abscess, gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeria meningitis. Ulcerative colitis: gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeriosis. Avoid initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of Ustekinumab-aekn in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn and discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. 5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with ustekinumab products may be susceptible to these types of infections. Consider appropriate diagnostic testing, (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances). 5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn. Avoid administering Ustekinumab-aekn to patients with active tuberculosis infection. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering Ustekinumab-aekn. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Ustekinumab-aekn in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving Ustekinumab-aekn for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment. 5.4 Malignancies Ustekinumab products are immunosuppressants and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received ustekinumab in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 )]. The safety of ustekinumab products has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving ustekinumab products who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non- melanoma skin cancer. Monitor all patients receiving Ustekinumab-aekn for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Closely follow patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.5 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with ustekinumab products in clinical trials and postmarketing. Some serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during the first intravenous dose of ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. If a severe or clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn\u2019s disease. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab product initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab products. Monitor all patients treated with Ustekinumab-aekn for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn. 5.7 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with Ustekinumab-aekn, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with Ustekinumab-aekn should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving Ustekinumab-aekn because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of Ustekinumab-aekn may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. 5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience ( 6.3 )]."

Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Table 5: Adverse Reactions, Reported by \u22651% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the ustekinumab groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis, and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for subjects receiving placebo and 13.4 weeks for ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of subjects receiving placebo (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects receiving placebo (0.02 per patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn\u2019s disease [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab\u2013Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=466 N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=133 N=131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn\u2019s disease clinical trials, 0.2% of ustekinumab- treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient- years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following ustekinumab administration. One subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Ulcerative Colitis The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of subjects receiving placebo (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In clinical trials in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ustekinumab product exposure. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, urticaria), including a fatal case that presented with chest tightness and dyspnea during infusion of the first dose . Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Skin reactions: Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Therapies In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis the safety of ustekinumab products in combination with immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. In trials in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD-1 and CD-2) and ulcerative colitis (UC-1), immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, MTX) were used concomitantly in approximately 30% of subjects and corticosteroids were used concomitantly in approximately 40% and 50% of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis subjects, respectively. Use of these concomitant therapies did not appear to influence the overall safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. 7.2 CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, use of ustekinumab products, antagonists of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Ustekinumab-aekn in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and adjust the individual dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates . A CYP-mediated drug interaction effect was not observed in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/Mother To Baby Pregnancy Registry, published literature and pharmacovigilance in pregnant women have not identified an ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in pregnancy. In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring after administration of ustekinumab to pregnant monkeys at exposures greater than 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Transport of endogenous IgG antibodies across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses, and peaks during the third trimester. Therefore, ustekinumab products may be present in infants exposed in utero . The potential clinical impact of ustekinumab products exposure in infants exposed in utero should be considered. Data Human Data An observational pregnancy registry conducted by (OTIS)/Mother To Baby in the U.S. and Canada (enrollment between 2013 and 2019) assessed the risk of major birth defects, pattern of major and minor anomalies in live-born infants, miscarriage, and adverse infant outcomes in women with ustekinumab exposure. In the registry study, there were 101 participants and 107 pregnancies with exposure to ustekinumab (88 prospective; 19 retrospective). Most participants had a primary indication of CD (65.4%) or psoriasis (30.8%). The pregnancy registry did not identify a ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, pattern of major or minor anomalies, increased risk of miscarriage or adverse infant outcomes. Methodological limitations of the registry include small sample size, lack of an internal comparison group, a mix of prospective and retrospective reports, and unmeasured confounders. The conclusions from the pregnancy registry were consistent with the published literature and pharmacovigilance. Animal Data Ustekinumab was tested in two embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No teratogenic or other adverse developmental effects were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered ustekinumab subcutaneously twice weekly or intravenously weekly during the period of organogenesis. Serum concentrations of ustekinumab in pregnant monkeys were greater than 100 times the serum concentration in patients treated subcutaneously with 90 mg of ustekinumab weekly for 4 weeks. In a combined embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab twice weekly at exposures greater than 100 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to Day 33 after delivery. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one monkey administered ustekinumab at 22.5 mg/kg and one monkey dosed at 45 mg/kg. No ustekinumab-related-effects on functional, morphological, or immunological development were observed in the neonates from birth through six months of age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from published literature suggests that ustekinumab is present in human breast milk. There are no available data on the effects of ustekinumab products on milk production. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to ustekinumab products are unknown. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant causally related to ustekinumab products have been identified in the published literature or postmarketing experience. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ustekinumab-aekn and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ustekinumab-aekn or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Plaque Psoriasis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have been established for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Use of Ustekinumab-aekn in pediatric patients 12 to less than 17 years of age is supported by evidence from a multicenter, randomized, 60 week trial (Ps STUDY 3) of ustekinumab that included a 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group portion, in 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Use of Ustekinumab-aekn in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from an open-label, single-arm, efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics trial (Ps STUDY 4) of ustekinumab in 44 subjects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )]. The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have been established for treatment of psoriatic arthritis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Ustekinumab-aekn in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of ustekinumab in adult subjects with psoriasis and PsA, pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and safety data of ustekinumab from two clinical trials in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old with psoriasis and 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with psoriasis. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and the PK exposure is expected to be comparable between adult and pediatric subjects with PsA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years old with psoriatic arthritis. Crohn\u2019s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 6709 subjects exposed to ustekinumab, a total of 340 were 65 years of age or older (183 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 65 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 58 subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 34 subjects with ulcerative colitis), and 40 subjects were 75 years of age or older. Clinical trials of ustekinumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell- surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plaque Psoriasis In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell- surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective."

Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab.

Published literature showed that administration of murine IL-12 caused an anti-tumor effect in mice that contained transplanted tumors and IL-12/IL-23p40 knockout mice or mice treated with anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody had decreased host defense to tumors. Mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL-23 or IL-12 alone developed UV-induced skin cancers earlier and more frequently compared to wild-type mice. The relevance of these experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown. No effects on fertility were observed in male cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ustekinumab at subcutaneous doses up to 45 mg/kg twice weekly (45 times the MRHD on a mg/kg basis) prior to and during the mating period. However, fertility and pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated in mated females.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u226512, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trials. Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The trials had the same design through Week 28. In both trials, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of ustekinumab. Subjects randomized to ustekinumab received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive ustekinumab (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16. In both trials, subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18. Baseline PGA score was marked or severe in 44% of subjects in Ps STUDY 1 and 40% of subjects in Ps STUDY 2. Approximately two-thirds of all subjects had received prior phototherapy, 69% had received either prior conventional systemic or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, with 56% receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 43% receiving prior biologic therapy. A total of 28% of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis. In both trials, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a 6-category scale ranging from 0 (cleared) to 5 (severe) that indicates the physician\u2019s overall assessment of psoriasis focusing on plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling. Clinical Response The results of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 are presented in Table 8 below. Table 8: Clinical Outcomes at Week 12 in Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response 8 (3%) 171 (67%) 170 (66%) 15 (4%) 273 (67%) 311 (76%) PGA of Cleared or Minimal 10 (4%) 151 (59%) 156 (61%) 18 (4%) 277 (68%) 300 (73%) Examination of age, gender, and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to ustekinumab among these subgroups. In subjects who weighed 100 kg or less, response rates were comparable with both the 45 mg and 90 mg doses; however, in subjects who weighed greater than 100 kg, higher response rates were seen with 90 mg dosing compared with 45 mg dosing (Table 9 below).

Subjects in Ps STUDY 1 who were PASI 75 responders at both Weeks 28 and 40 were re-randomized at Week 40 to either continued dosing of ustekinumab (ustekinumab at Week 40) or to withdrawal of therapy (placebo at Week 40). At Week 52, 89% (144/162) of subjects re-randomized to ustekinumab treatment were PASI 75 responders compared with 63% (100/159) of subjects re-randomized to placebo (treatment withdrawal after Week 28 dose). The median time to loss of PASI 75 response among the subjects randomized to treatment withdrawal was 16 weeks. 14.2 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis A multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (Ps STUDY 3) enrolled 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with a minimum BSA involvement of 10%, a PASI score greater than or equal to 12, and a PGA score greater than or equal to 3, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37), the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 36), or one-half the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 37) by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by dosing every 12 weeks (q12w). The recommended dose of ustekinumab was 0.75 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 60 kg, 45 mg for subjects weighing 60 kg to 100 kg, and 90 mg for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg. At Week 12, subjects who received placebo were crossed over to receive ustekinumab at the recommended dose or one-half the recommended dose. Of the pediatric subjects, approximately 63% had prior exposure to phototherapy or conventional systemic therapy and approximately 11% had prior exposure to biologics. The endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1), PASI 75, and PASI 90 at Week 12. Subjects were followed for up to 60 weeks following first administration of trial agent. Clinical Response The efficacy results at Week 12 for Ps STUDY 3 are presented in Table 10.

Subjects in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. Subjects with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules (39%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (28%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (21%), distal interphalangeal involvement (12%) and arthritis mutilans (0.5%). Over 70% and 40% of the patients, respectively, had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of subjects continued on stable doses of MTX (\u226425 mg/week). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24. In PsA STUDY 1 and PsA STUDY 2, 80% and 86% of the subjects, respectively, had been previously treated with DMARDs. In PsA STUDY 1, previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 agent was not allowed. In PsA STUDY 2, 58% (n=180) of the subjects had been previously treated with TNF blocker, of whom over 70% had discontinued their TNF blocker treatment for lack of efficacy or intolerance at any time. Clinical Response In both trials, a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (see Table 11 ). ACR 70 responses were also higher in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, although the difference was only numerical (p=NS) in STUDY 2. Responses were consistent in subjects treated with ustekinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate. Responses were similar in subjects regardless of prior TNF\u03b1 exposure.

Physical Function Ustekinumab-treated subjects showed improvement in physical function compared to subjects receiving placebo as assessed by HAQ-DI at Week 24. In both trials, the proportion of HAQ-DI responders (\u22650.3 improvement in HAQ-DI score) was greater in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24. Image 14.4 Crohn\u2019s Disease Ustekinumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction trials (CD-1 and CD-2) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (CD-3) representing 52 weeks of therapy. Subjects in CD-1 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers, while subjects in CD-2 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed treatment with a TNF blocker. Trials CD-1 and CD-2 In trials CD-1 and CD-2, 1409 subjects were randomized, of whom 1368 (CD-1, n=741; CD-2, n=627) were included in the final efficacy analysis. Induction of clinical response (defined as a reduction in CDAI score of greater than or equal to 100 points or CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 6 and clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 8 were evaluated. In both trials, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab at either approximately 6 mg/kg, placebo (see Table 4 ), or 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended). In trial CD-1, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with a TNF blocker: 29% subjects had an inadequate initial response (primary non-responders), 69% responded but subsequently lost response (secondary non-responders) and 36% were intolerant to a TNF blocker. Of these subjects, 48% failed or were intolerant to one TNF blocker and 52% had failed 2 or 3 prior TNF blockers. At baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 46% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 31% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 319 in the ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg group and 313 in the placebo group. In trial CD-2, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with corticosteroids (81% of subjects), at least one immunomodulator (6-MP, AZA, MTX; 68% of subjects), or both (49% of subjects). Additionally, 69% never received a TNF blocker and 31% previously received but had not failed a TNF blocker. At baseline, and throughout the trial, approximately 39% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 35% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 286 in the ustekinumab and 290 in the placebo group. In these induction trials, a greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) achieved clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remission at Week 8 compared to placebo (see Table 13 for clinical response and remission rates). Clinical response and remission were significant as early as Week 3 in ustekinumab-treated subjects and continued to improve through Week 8.

At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 34/56 (61%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapies were in clinical remission and 23/56 (41%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 27/61 (44%) subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 16/61 (26%) of these subjects were in remission at Week 44. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 46/72 (64%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who had previously failed immunomodulator therapy or corticosteroids (but not TNF blockers) were in clinical remission and 45/72 (63%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 50/70 (71%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 31/70 (44%) were in remission at Week 44. In the subset of these subjects who were also na\u00efve to TNF blockers, 34/52 (65%) of ustekinumab-treated subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44 as compared to 25/51 (49%) in the placebo arm. Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after ustekinumab induction were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial CD-3; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab upon entry into trial CD-3. Of these subjects, 102/219 (47%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later and were followed for the duration of the trial. 14.5 Ulcerative Colitis Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [UC-1 and UC-2 (NCT02407236)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate a biologic (i.e., TNF blocker and/or vedolizumab), corticosteroids, and/or 6-MP or AZA therapy. The 8-week intravenous induction trial (UC-1) was followed by the 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (UC-2) for a total of 52 weeks of therapy. Disease assessment was based on the Mayo score, which ranged from 0 to 12 and has four subscores that were each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally-reviewed endoscopy, and physician global assessment. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was defined at baseline (Week 0) as Mayo score of 6 to 12, including a Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22652. An endoscopy score of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; and a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding, ulceration. At baseline, subjects had a median Mayo score of 9, with 84% of subjects having moderate disease (Mayo score 6-10) and 15% having severe disease (Mayo score 11-12). Subjects in these trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and oral corticosteroids (prednisone). Trial UC-1 In UC-1, 961 subjects were randomized at Week 0 to a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab of approximately 6 mg/kg, 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo. Subjects enrolled in UC-1 had to have failed therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or at least one biologic. A total of 51% had failed at least one biologic and 17% had failed both a TNF blocker and an integrin receptor blocker. Of the total population, 46% had failed corticosteroids or immunomodulators but were biologic-na\u00efve and an additional 3% had previously received but had not failed a biologic. At induction baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 52% subjects were receiving oral corticosteroids, 28% subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) and 69% subjects were receiving aminosalicylates. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission with a definition of: Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal bleeding), and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and Mayo subscore of 1 defined as presence of erythema, decreased vascular pattern and no friability) is provided in Table 15. The secondary endpoints were clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic- endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical response with a definition of (\u2265 2 points and \u2265 30% decrease in modified Mayo score, defined as 3-component Mayo score without the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), endoscopic improvement with a definition of Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement with a definition of combined endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement of the colon tissue [neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue]) are provided in Table 15. In UC-1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) were in clinical remission and response and achieved endoscopic improvement and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement compared to placebo (see Table 15 ).

Rectal Bleeding and Stool Frequency Subscores Decreases in rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores were observed as early as Week 2 in ustekinumab-treated subjects. Trial UC-2 The maintenance trial (UC-2) evaluated 523 subjects who achieved clinical response 8 weeks following the intravenous administration of either induction dose of ustekinumab in UC-1. These subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or every 12 weeks (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo for 44 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical response at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 44, and the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction. Results of the primary and secondary endpoints at Week 44 in subjects treated with ustekinumab at the recommended dosage (90 mg every 8 weeks) compared to the placebo are shown in Table 16.

Of these subjects, 55/101 (54%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later (Week 16) and received ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks during the UC-2 trial. At Week 44, there were 97/157 (62%) subjects who maintained clinical response and there were 51/157 (32%) who achieved clinical remission. Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement at Week 44 The proportion of subjects achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement during maintenance treatment in UC-2 was 75/172 (44%) among subjects on ustekinumab and 40/172 (23%) in subjects on placebo at Week 44. The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-2, at Week 44 to progression of disease or long-term outcomes was not evaluated in UC-2. Endoscopic Normalization Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. At Week 8 in UC-1, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 25/322 (8%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and 12/319 (4%) of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 44 of UC-2, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 51/176 (29%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and in 32/175 (18%) of subjects in placebo group."

Make sure the syringe is not damaged. Check the prefilled syringe for any particles or discoloration. The liquid in the prefilled syringe should look clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution and should not have any particles. Do not use if it is frozen, discolored, cloudy, or has large particles. Get a new prefilled syringe Do not shake the prefilled syringe at any time. Shaking the prefilled syringe may damage Ustekinumab-aekn medicine. If the prefilled syringe has been shaken, do not use it. Get a new prefilled syringe. To reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks, each prefilled syringe has a needle guard that is automatically activated to cover the needle after you have given the injection. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Storing Ustekinumab-aekn prefilled syringes Store Ustekinumab-aekn prefilled syringes in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

If needed, individual prefilled syringes may be stored at room temperature up to 86\u00b0F(30\u00b0C) for a maximum single period of up to 30 days in the original carton to protect from light. Record the date when the prefilled syringe is first removed from the refrigerator on the carton in the space provided. After a prefilled syringe has been stored at room temperature, do not return it to the refrigerator. Throw away (discard) the prefilled syringe if not used within 30 days at room temperature storage. Do not use Ustekinumab-aekn after the expiration date on the carton or on the prefilled syringe. Keep Ustekinumab-aekn and all medicines out of the reach of children. Preparing to inject Ustekinumab-aekn Gather the supplies you will need to prepare and to give the injection. (See Figure B) You will need: antiseptic wipes cotton balls or gauze pads adhesive bandage your prescribed dose of Ustekinumab-aekn (See Figure A) FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \"Step 4: Disposing of the used prefilled syringe.\" Step 1: Preparing the Injection Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Hold the prefilled syringe with the covered needle pointing upward. Step 2: Preparing the injection site Choose an injection site around the stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, or upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. (See Figure C) Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender,bruised, red or hard. Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give the injection. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let the skin dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Do not inject through clothes. Step 3: Injecting Ustekinumab-aekn Remove the needle cover when you are ready to inject Ustekinumab-aekn. Do not touch the plunger or plunger head while removing the needle cover. Hold the body of the prefilled syringe with one hand, and pull the needle cover straight off. (See Figure D) Put the needle cover in the trash. Do not recap. You may also see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. Do not touch the needle or let it touch anything. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the needle cover in place. Hold the body of the prefilled syringe in one hand between the thumb and index fingers.(See Figure E) Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure F) Inject all of the liquid by using your thumb to push in the plunger until the plunger head is completely between the needle guard activation clips. (See Figure G) When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, keep pressure on the plunger head. Take the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. Slowly take your thumb off the plunger head. This will let the empty syringe move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard. (See Figure H) When the needle is pulled out of the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad on the skin of the injection site, if needed (See Figure I) . Do not rub the injection site. Cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the second injection using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 4: Disposing of the syringes Put the syringe in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure J). Do not throw away (dispose of) syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Manufactured By: Alvotech USA Inc.

You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive two 45 mg vials and you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 5 for using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 6: Disposing of the needles, syringes and vials. Do not re-use a syringe or needle. To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap a needle. Put the needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out upright and stable during use leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. Throw away the vial into the container where you put the syringes and needles. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

Ustekinumab-aekn should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient\u2019s current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that Ustekinumab-aekn be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject Ustekinumab-aekn after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Not made with natural rubber latex. It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27-gauge, 1/2 inch needle is recommended. Prior to administration, visually inspect Ustekinumab-aekn for particulate matter and discoloration. Ustekinumab-aekn is a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution and free of visible particles. Do not use Ustekinumab-aekn if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. Ustekinumab-aekn does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of Ustekinumab-aekn 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn\u2019s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) Ustekinumab-aekn solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of Ustekinumab-aekn vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of Ustekinumab-aekn contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-aekn. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of Ustekinumab-aekn to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of Ustekinumab-aekn needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Withdraw 26 mL of Ustekinumab-aekn from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within four hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse Ustekinumab-aekn concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. Ustekinumab-aekn does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 4 hours. Protect the diluted solution from light. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 4 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections: Serious infections have occurred. Avoid starting Ustekinumab-aekn during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection or clinically significant infection develops, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn until the infection resolves. ( 5.1 ) Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections : Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23. Consider diagnostic tests for these infections as dictated by clinical circumstances. ( 5.2 ) Tuberculosis (TB): Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering Ustekinumab-aekn. ( 5.3 ) Malignancies: Ustekinumab products may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of ustekinumab products in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a severe or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): If PRES is suspected, treat promptly, and discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn. ( 5.6 ) Immunizations: Avoid use of live vaccines in patients during treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn. ( 5.7 ) Noninfectious Pneumonia: Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infections Ustekinumab products may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Serious infections requiring hospitalization, or otherwise clinically significant infections, reported in clinical trials included the following: Plaque Psoriasis: diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infections. Psoriatic arthritis: cholecystitis. Crohn\u2019s disease: anal abscess, gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeria meningitis. Ulcerative colitis: gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeriosis. Avoid initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of Ustekinumab-aekn in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn and discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. 5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with ustekinumab products may be susceptible to these types of infections. Consider appropriate diagnostic testing, (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances). 5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn. Avoid administering Ustekinumab-aekn to patients with active tuberculosis infection. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering Ustekinumab-aekn. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Ustekinumab-aekn in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving Ustekinumab-aekn for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment. 5.4 Malignancies Ustekinumab products are immunosuppressants and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received ustekinumab in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 )]. The safety of ustekinumab products has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving ustekinumab products who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non- melanoma skin cancer. Monitor all patients receiving Ustekinumab-aekn for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Closely follow patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.5 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with ustekinumab products in clinical trials and postmarketing. Some serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during the first intravenous dose of ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. If a severe or clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn\u2019s disease. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab product initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab products. Monitor all patients treated with Ustekinumab-aekn for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn. 5.7 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with Ustekinumab-aekn, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with Ustekinumab-aekn should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with Ustekinumab-aekn or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving Ustekinumab-aekn because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of Ustekinumab-aekn may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. 5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab-aekn and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience ( 6.3 )]."

Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Table 5: Adverse Reactions, Reported by \u22651% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the ustekinumab groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis, and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for subjects receiving placebo and 13.4 weeks for ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of subjects receiving placebo (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects receiving placebo (0.02 per patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn\u2019s disease [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab\u2013Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=466 N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab\u2013Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=133 N=131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn\u2019s disease clinical trials, 0.2% of ustekinumab- treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient- years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following ustekinumab administration. One subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Ulcerative Colitis The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of subjects receiving placebo (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In clinical trials in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ustekinumab product exposure. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, urticaria), including a fatal case that presented with chest tightness and dyspnea during infusion of the first dose . Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Skin reactions: Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Therapies In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis the safety of ustekinumab products in combination with immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. In trials in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD-1 and CD-2) and ulcerative colitis (UC-1), immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, MTX) were used concomitantly in approximately 30% of subjects and corticosteroids were used concomitantly in approximately 40% and 50% of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis subjects, respectively. Use of these concomitant therapies did not appear to influence the overall safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. 7.2 CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, use of ustekinumab products, antagonists of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Ustekinumab-aekn in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and adjust the individual dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates . A CYP-mediated drug interaction effect was not observed in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/Mother To Baby Pregnancy Registry, published literature and pharmacovigilance in pregnant women have not identified an ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in pregnancy. In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring after administration of ustekinumab to pregnant monkeys at exposures greater than 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Transport of endogenous IgG antibodies across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses, and peaks during the third trimester. Therefore, ustekinumab products may be present in infants exposed in utero . The potential clinical impact of ustekinumab products exposure in infants exposed in utero should be considered. Data Human Data An observational pregnancy registry conducted by (OTIS)/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada (enrollment between 2013 and 2019) assessed the risk of major birth defects, pattern of major and minor anomalies in live-born infants, miscarriage, and adverse infant outcomes in women with ustekinumab exposure. In the registry study, there were 101 participants and 107 pregnancies with exposure to ustekinumab (88 prospective; 19 retrospective). Most participants had a primary indication of CD (65.4%) or psoriasis (30.8%). The pregnancy registry did not identify a ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, pattern of major or minor anomalies, increased risk of miscarriage or adverse infant outcomes. Methodological limitations of the registry include small sample size, lack of an internal comparison group, a mix of prospective and retrospective reports, and unmeasured confounders. The conclusions from the pregnancy registry were consistent with the published literature and pharmacovigilance. Animal Data Ustekinumab was tested in two embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No teratogenic or other adverse developmental effects were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered ustekinumab subcutaneously twice weekly or intravenously weekly during the period of organogenesis. Serum concentrations of ustekinumab in pregnant monkeys were greater than 100 times the serum concentration in patients treated subcutaneously with 90 mg of ustekinumab weekly for 4 weeks. In a combined embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab twice weekly at exposures greater than 100 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to Day 33 after delivery. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one monkey administered ustekinumab at 22.5 mg/kg and one monkey dosed at 45 mg/kg. No ustekinumab-related-effects on functional, morphological, or immunological development were observed in the neonates from birth through six months of age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from published literature suggests that ustekinumab is present in human breast milk. There are no available data on the effects of ustekinumab products on milk production. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to ustekinumab products are unknown. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant causally related to ustekinumab products have been identified in the published literature or postmarketing experience. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ustekinumab-aekn and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ustekinumab-aekn or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Plaque Psoriasis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have been established for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Use of Ustekinumab-aekn in pediatric patients 12 to less than 17 years of age is supported by evidence from a multicenter, randomized, 60 week trial (Ps STUDY 3) of ustekinumab that included a 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group portion, in 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Use of Ustekinumab-aekn in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from an open-label, single-arm, efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics trial (Ps STUDY 4) of ustekinumab in 44 subjects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )]. The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have been established for treatment of psoriatic arthritis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Ustekinumab-aekn in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of ustekinumab in adult subjects with psoriasis and PsA, pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and safety data of ustekinumab from two clinical trials in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old with psoriasis and 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with psoriasis. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and the PK exposure is expected to be comparable between adult and pediatric subjects with PsA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years old with psoriatic arthritis. Crohn\u2019s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aekn have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 6709 subjects exposed to ustekinumab, a total of 340 were 65 years of age or older (183 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 65 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 58 subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 34 subjects with ulcerative colitis), and 40 subjects were 75 years of age or older. Clinical trials of ustekinumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell- surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plaque Psoriasis In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell- surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective."

Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u226512, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trials. Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The trials had the same design through Week 28. In both trials, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of ustekinumab. Subjects randomized to ustekinumab received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive ustekinumab (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16. In both trials, subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18. Baseline PGA score was marked or severe in 44% of subjects in Ps STUDY 1 and 40% of subjects in Ps STUDY 2. Approximately two-thirds of all subjects had received prior phototherapy, 69% had received either prior conventional systemic or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, with 56% receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 43% receiving prior biologic therapy. A total of 28% of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis. In both trials, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a 6-category scale ranging from 0 (cleared) to 5 (severe) that indicates the physician\u2019s overall assessment of psoriasis focusing on plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling. Clinical Response The results of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 are presented in Table 8 below. Table 8: Clinical Outcomes at Week 12 in Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response 8 (3%) 171 (67%) 170 (66%) 15 (4%) 273 (67%) 311 (76%) PGA of Cleared or Minimal 10 (4%) 151 (59%) 156 (61%) 18 (4%) 277 (68%) 300 (73%) Examination of age, gender, and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to ustekinumab among these subgroups. In subjects who weighed 100 kg or less, response rates were comparable with both the 45 mg and 90 mg doses; however, in subjects who weighed greater than 100 kg, higher response rates were seen with 90 mg dosing compared with 45 mg dosing (Table 9 below).

Subjects in Ps STUDY 1 who were PASI 75 responders at both Weeks 28 and 40 were re-randomized at Week 40 to either continued dosing of ustekinumab (ustekinumab at Week 40) or to withdrawal of therapy (placebo at Week 40). At Week 52, 89% (144/162) of subjects re-randomized to ustekinumab treatment were PASI 75 responders compared with 63% (100/159) of subjects re-randomized to placebo (treatment withdrawal after Week 28 dose). The median time to loss of PASI 75 response among the subjects randomized to treatment withdrawal was 16 weeks. 14.2 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis A multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (Ps STUDY 3) enrolled 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with a minimum BSA involvement of 10%, a PASI score greater than or equal to 12, and a PGA score greater than or equal to 3, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37), the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 36), or one-half the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 37) by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by dosing every 12 weeks (q12w). The recommended dose of ustekinumab was 0.75 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 60 kg, 45 mg for subjects weighing 60 kg to 100 kg, and 90 mg for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg. At Week 12, subjects who received placebo were crossed over to receive ustekinumab at the recommended dose or one-half the recommended dose. Of the pediatric subjects, approximately 63% had prior exposure to phototherapy or conventional systemic therapy and approximately 11% had prior exposure to biologics. The endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1), PASI 75, and PASI 90 at Week 12. Subjects were followed for up to 60 weeks following first administration of trial agent. Clinical Response The efficacy results at Week 12 for Ps STUDY 3 are presented in Table 10.

Subjects in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. Subjects with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules (39%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (28%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (21%), distal interphalangeal involvement (12%) and arthritis mutilans (0.5%). Over 70% and 40% of the patients, respectively, had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of subjects continued on stable doses of MTX (\u226425 mg/week). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24. In PsA STUDY 1 and PsA STUDY 2, 80% and 86% of the subjects, respectively, had been previously treated with DMARDs. In PsA STUDY 1, previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 agent was not allowed. In PsA STUDY 2, 58% (n=180) of the subjects had been previously treated with TNF blocker, of whom over 70% had discontinued their TNF blocker treatment for lack of efficacy or intolerance at any time. Clinical Response In both trials, a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (see Table 11 ). ACR 70 responses were also higher in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, although the difference was only numerical (p=NS) in STUDY 2. Responses were consistent in subjects treated with ustekinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate. Responses were similar in subjects regardless of prior TNF\u03b1 exposure.

Physical Function Ustekinumab-treated subjects showed improvement in physical function compared to subjects receiving placebo as assessed by HAQ-DI at Week 24. In both trials, the proportion of HAQ-DI responders (\u22650.3 improvement in HAQ-DI score) was greater in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24. 1 14.4 Crohn\u2019s Disease Ustekinumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction trials (CD-1 and CD-2) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (CD-3) representing 52 weeks of therapy. Subjects in CD-1 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers, while subjects in CD-2 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed treatment with a TNF blocker. Trials CD-1 and CD-2 In trials CD-1 and CD-2, 1409 subjects were randomized, of whom 1368 (CD-1, n=741; CD-2, n=627) were included in the final efficacy analysis. Induction of clinical response (defined as a reduction in CDAI score of greater than or equal to 100 points or CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 6 and clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 8 were evaluated. In both trials, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab at either approximately 6 mg/kg, placebo (see Table 4 ), or 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended). In trial CD-1, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with a TNF blocker: 29% subjects had an inadequate initial response (primary non-responders), 69% responded but subsequently lost response (secondary non-responders) and 36% were intolerant to a TNF blocker. Of these subjects, 48% failed or were intolerant to one TNF blocker and 52% had failed 2 or 3 prior TNF blockers. At baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 46% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 31% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 319 in the ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg group and 313 in the placebo group. In trial CD-2, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with corticosteroids (81% of subjects), at least one immunomodulator (6-MP, AZA, MTX; 68% of subjects), or both (49% of subjects). Additionally, 69% never received a TNF blocker and 31% previously received but had not failed a TNF blocker. At baseline, and throughout the trial, approximately 39% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 35% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 286 in the ustekinumab and 290 in the placebo group. In these induction trials, a greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) achieved clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remission at Week 8 compared to placebo (see Table 13 for clinical response and remission rates). Clinical response and remission were significant as early as Week 3 in ustekinumab-treated subjects and continued to improve through Week 8.

At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 34/56 (61%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapies were in clinical remission and 23/56 (41%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 27/61 (44%) subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 16/61 (26%) of these subjects were in remission at Week 44. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 46/72 (64%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who had previously failed immunomodulator therapy or corticosteroids (but not TNF blockers) were in clinical remission and 45/72 (63%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 50/70 (71%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 31/70 (44%) were in remission at Week 44. In the subset of these subjects who were also na\u00efve to TNF blockers, 34/52 (65%) of ustekinumab-treated subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44 as compared to 25/51 (49%) in the placebo arm. Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after ustekinumab induction were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial CD-3; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab upon entry into trial CD-3. Of these subjects, 102/219 (47%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later and were followed for the duration of the trial. 14.5 Ulcerative Colitis Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [UC-1 and UC-2 (NCT02407236)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate a biologic (i.e., TNF blocker and/or vedolizumab), corticosteroids, and/or 6-MP or AZA therapy. The 8-week intravenous induction trial (UC-1) was followed by the 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (UC-2) for a total of 52 weeks of therapy. Disease assessment was based on the Mayo score, which ranged from 0 to 12 and has four subscores that were each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally-reviewed endoscopy, and physician global assessment. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was defined at baseline (Week 0) as Mayo score of 6 to 12, including a Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22652. An endoscopy score of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; and a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding, ulceration. At baseline, subjects had a median Mayo score of 9, with 84% of subjects having moderate disease (Mayo score 6-10) and 15% having severe disease (Mayo score 11-12). Subjects in these trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and oral corticosteroids (prednisone). Trial UC-1 In UC-1, 961 subjects were randomized at Week 0 to a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab of approximately 6 mg/kg, 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo. Subjects enrolled in UC-1 had to have failed therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or at least one biologic. A total of 51% had failed at least one biologic and 17% had failed both a TNF blocker and an integrin receptor blocker. Of the total population, 46% had failed corticosteroids or immunomodulators but were biologic-na\u00efve and an additional 3% had previously received but had not failed a biologic. At induction baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 52% subjects were receiving oral corticosteroids, 28% subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) and 69% subjects were receiving aminosalicylates. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission with a definition of: Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal bleeding), and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and Mayo subscore of 1 defined as presence of erythema, decreased vascular pattern and no friability) is provided in Table 15. The secondary endpoints were clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic- endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical response with a definition of (\u2265 2 points and \u2265 30% decrease in modified Mayo score, defined as 3-component Mayo score without the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), endoscopic improvement with a definition of Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement with a definition of combined endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement of the colon tissue [neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue]) are provided in Table 15. In UC-1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) were in clinical remission and response and achieved endoscopic improvement and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement compared to placebo (see Table 15 ).

Rectal Bleeding and Stool Frequency Subscores Decreases in rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores were observed as early as Week 2 in ustekinumab-treated subjects. Trial UC-2 The maintenance trial (UC-2) evaluated 523 subjects who achieved clinical response 8 weeks following the intravenous administration of either induction dose of ustekinumab in UC-1. These subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or every 12 weeks (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo for 44 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical response at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 44, and the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction. Results of the primary and secondary endpoints at Week 44 in subjects treated with ustekinumab at the recommended dosage (90 mg every 8 weeks) compared to the placebo are shown in Table 16.

Of these subjects, 55/101 (54%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later (Week 16) and received ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks during the UC-2 trial. At Week 44, there were 97/157 (62%) subjects who maintained clinical response and there were 51/157 (32%) who achieved clinical remission. Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement at Week 44 The proportion of subjects achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement during maintenance treatment in UC-2 was 75/172 (44%) among subjects on ustekinumab and 40/172 (23%) in subjects on placebo at Week 44. The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-2, at Week 44 to progression of disease or long-term outcomes was not evaluated in UC-2. Endoscopic Normalization Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. At Week 8 in UC-1, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 25/322 (8%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and 12/319 (4%) of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 44 of UC-2, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 51/176 (29%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and in 32/175 (18%) of subjects in placebo group."

Make sure the syringe is not damaged. Check the prefilled syringe for any particles or discoloration. The liquid in the prefilled syringe should look clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution and should not have any particles. Do not use if it is frozen, discolored, cloudy, or has large particles. Get a new prefilled syringe. Do not shake the prefilled syringe at any time . Shaking the prefilled syringe may damage Ustekinumab-aekn medicine. If the prefilled syringe has been shaken, do not use it. Get a new prefilled syringe. To reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks, each prefilled syringe has a needle guard that is automatically activated to cover the needle after you have given the injection. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Storing Ustekinumab-aekn prefilled syringes Store Ustekinumab-aekn prefilled syringes in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

Do not use Ustekinumab-aekn after the expiration date on the carton or on the prefilled syringe. Keep Ustekinumab-aekn and all medicines out of the reach of children. Preparing to inject Ustekinumab-aekn Gather the supplies you will need to prepare and to give the injection. (See Figure B) You will need: antiseptic wipes cotton balls or gauze pads adhesive bandage your prescribed dose of Ustekinumab-aekn (See Figure A) FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \"Step 4: Disposing of the used prefilled syringe.\" Step 1: Preparing the Injection Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Hold the prefilled syringe with the covered needle pointing upward. Step 2: Preparing the injection site Choose an injection site around the stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, or upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. (See Figure C) Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard. Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give your injection. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let your skin dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Do not inject through clothes. Step 3: Injecting Ustekinumab-aekn Remove the needle cover when you are ready to inject Ustekinumab-aekn. Do not touch the plunger or plunger head while removing the needle cover. Hold the body of the prefilled syringe with one hand,and pull the needle cover straight off. (See Figure D) Put the needle cover in the trash. Do not recap. You may also see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. Do not touch the needle or let it touch anything. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the needle cover in place. Hold the body of the prefilled syringe in one hand between the thumb and index fingers. (See Figure E) Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure F) Inject all of the liquid by using your thumb to push in the plunger until the plunger head is completely between the needle guard activation clips. (See Figure G) When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, keep pressure on the plunger head. Take the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. Slowly take your thumb off the plunger head. This will let the empty syringe move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard. (See Figure H) When the needle is pulled out of with the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad on the skin of the injection site, if needed (See Figure I) . Do not rub the injection site. Cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the second injection using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 4: Disposing of the syringes Put the syringe in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (See Figure J). Do not throw away (dispose of) syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Manufactured By: Alvotech USA Inc.

Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure I) Push the plunger with your thumb as far as it will go to inject all of the liquid. Push it slowly and evenly, keeping the skin gently pinched. When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. (See Figure J) When the needle is pulled out of the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive two 45 mg vials and you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 5 for using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 6: Disposing of the needles, syringes and vials. Do not re-use a syringe or needle. To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap a needle. Put the needles and syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. Throw away the vial into the container where you put the syringes and needles. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out upright and stable during use leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.

Ustekinumab should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that Ustekinumab be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject Ustekinumab after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use] . The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex). The needle cover should not be handled by persons sensitive to latex. It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27 gauge, \u00bd inch needle is recommended. Prior to administration, visually inspect Ustekinumab for particulate matter and discoloration. Ustekinumab is a colorless to light yellow solution and may contain a few small translucent or white particles. Do not use Ustekinumab if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. Ustekinumab does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of Ustekinumab 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) Ustekinumab solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared, and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of Ustekinumab vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of Ustekinumab contains 130 mg of ustekinumab. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of Ustekinumab to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of Ustekinumab needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used. Withdraw 26 mL of Ustekinumab from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within eight hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse Ustekinumab concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. Ustekinumab does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for a one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) for up to 7 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 8 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections : Serious infections have occurred. Avoid starting Ustekinumab during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection or clinically significant infection develops, discontinue Ustekinumab until the infection resolves. ( 5.1 ) Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections : Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23. Consider diagnostic tests for these infections as dictated by clinical circumstances. ( 5.2 ) Tuberculosis (TB) : Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering Ustekinumab. ( 5.3 ) Malignancies : Ustekinumab may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of Ustekinumab in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions : If a severe or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Ustekinumab immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) : If PRES is suspected, treat promptly, and discontinue Ustekinumab. ( 5.6 ) Immunizations: Avoid use of live vaccines in patients during treatment with Ustekinumab. ( 5.7 ) Noninfectious Pneumonia : Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of Ustekinumab. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infections Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving Ustekinumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3) ] . Serious infections requiring hospitalization, or otherwise clinically significant infections, reported in clinical trials included the following: Plaque Psoriasis : diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infections. Psoriatic arthritis : cholecystitis. Crohn's disease : anal abscess, gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeria meningitis. Ulcerative colitis : gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeriosis. Avoid initiating treatment with Ustekinumab in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of Ustekinumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with Ustekinumab and discontinue Ustekinumab for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. 5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with Ustekinumab may be susceptible to these types of infections. Consider appropriate diagnostic testing, (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances). 5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab. Avoid administering Ustekinumab to patients with active tuberculosis infection. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering Ustekinumab. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Ustekinumab in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving Ustekinumab for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment. 5.4 Malignancies Ustekinumab is an immunosuppressant and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received Ustekinumab in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) ] . The safety of Ustekinumab has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving Ustekinumab who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer. Monitor all patients receiving Ustekinumab for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Closely follow patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.5 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with Ustekinumab in clinical trials and postmarketing. Some serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during the first intravenous dose of Ustekinumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3) ] . If a severe or clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Ustekinumab immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab. Monitor all patients treated with Ustekinumab for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue Ustekinumab. 5.7 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with Ustekinumab, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with Ustekinumab should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with Ustekinumab or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving Ustekinumab because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of Ustekinumab may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. 5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of Ustekinumab. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience (6.3) ] ."

Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to Ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the Ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 5: Adverse Reactions, Reported by \u22651% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the Ustekinumab groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis, and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for subjects receiving placebo and 13.4 weeks for Ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of subjects receiving placebo (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects receiving placebo (0.02 per patient-year of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in Ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of Ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of Ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of Ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in Ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn's Disease The safety of Ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg Ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The overall safety profile of Ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=466 N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=133 N=131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn's disease clinical trials, 0.2% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following Ustekinumab administration. One subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous Ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous Ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous Ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Ulcerative Colitis The safety of Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The overall safety profile of Ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs. 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of Ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of subjects receiving placebo (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in studies of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with Ustekinumab in clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In clinical trials in subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with Ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Ustekinumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Ustekinumab exposure. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, and urticaria), including a fatal case that presented with chest tightness and dyspnea during infusion of the first dose . Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) . Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Skin reactions : Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Therapies In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis the safety of Ustekinumab in combination with immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of Ustekinumab. In trials in subjects with Crohn's disease (CD-1 and CD-2) and ulcerative colitis (UC-1), immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, MTX) were used concomitantly in approximately 30% of subjects and corticosteroids were used concomitantly in approximately 40% and 50% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis subjects, respectively. Use of these concomitant therapies did not appear to influence the overall safety or efficacy of Ustekinumab. 7.2 CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, use of Ustekinumab, an antagonist of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Ustekinumab in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and adjust the individual dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates. A CYP-mediated drug interaction effect was not observed in subjects with Crohn's disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab has not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Ustekinumab Pregnancy Registry, published literature and pharmacovigilance in pregnant women have not identified a Ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in pregnancy. In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring after administration of ustekinumab to pregnant monkeys at exposures greater than 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Transport of endogenous IgG antibodies across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses, and peaks during the third trimester. Therefore, Ustekinumab may be present in infants exposed in utero . The potential clinical impact of ustekinumab exposure in infants exposed in utero should be considered. Data Human Data An observational pregnancy registry conducted by (OTIS)/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada (enrollment between 2013 and 2019) assessed the risk of major birth defects, pattern of major and minor anomalies in live-born infants, miscarriage, and adverse infant outcomes in women with Ustekinumab exposure. In the registry study, there were 101 participants and 107 pregnancies with exposure to Ustekinumab (88 prospective; 19 retrospective). Most participants had a primary indication of CD (65.4%) or psoriasis (30.8%). The pregnancy registry did not identify a Ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, pattern of major or minor anomalies, increased risk of miscarriage or adverse infant outcomes. Methodological limitations of the registry include small sample size, lack of an internal comparison group, a mix of prospective and retrospective reports, and unmeasured confounders. The conclusions from the pregnancy registry were consistent with the published literature and pharmacovigilance. Animal Data Ustekinumab was tested in two embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No teratogenic or other adverse developmental effects were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered ustekinumab subcutaneously twice weekly or intravenously weekly during the period of organogenesis. Serum concentrations of ustekinumab in pregnant monkeys were greater than 100 times the serum concentration in patients treated subcutaneously with 90 mg of ustekinumab weekly for 4 weeks. In a combined embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab twice weekly at exposures greater than 100 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to Day 33 after delivery. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one monkey administered ustekinumab at 22.5 mg/kg and one monkey dosed at 45 mg/kg. No ustekinumab-related- effects on functional, morphological, or immunological development were observed in the neonates from birth through six months of age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from published literature suggests that ustekinumab is present in human breast milk. There are no available data on the effects of ustekinumab on milk production. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to ustekinumab are unknown. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant causally related to ustekinumab have been identified in the published literature or postmarketing experience. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ustekinumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ustekinumab or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Plaque Psoriasis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab have been established for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Use of Ustekinumab in pediatric patients 12 to less than 17 years of age is supported by evidence from a multicenter, randomized, 60 week trial (Ps STUDY 3) that included a 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group portion, in 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Use of Ustekinumab in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from an open-label, single-arm, efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics trial (Ps STUDY 4) in 44 subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab have been established for treatment of psoriatic arthritis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Ustekinumab in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of Ustekinumab in adult subjects with psoriasis and PsA, pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and safety data from two clinical trials in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old with psoriasis and 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with psoriasis. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and the PK exposure is expected to be comparable between adult and pediatric subjects with PsA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years old with psoriatic arthritis. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 6709 subjects exposed to Ustekinumab, a total of 340 were 65 years of age or older (183 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 65 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 58 subjects with Crohn's disease, and 34 subjects with ulcerative colitis), and 40 subjects were 75 years of age or older. Clinical trials of Ustekinumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab is a human IgG1\u049b monoclonal antibody that binds with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab was shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell-surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab, was shown to be protective. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plaque Psoriasis In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of Ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of Ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of Ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn's disease [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of Ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of Ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn's disease [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

Published literature showed that administration of murine IL-12 caused an anti-tumor effect in mice that contained transplanted tumors and IL-12/IL-23p40 knockout mice or mice treated with anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody had decreased host defense to tumors. Mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL-23 or IL-12 alone developed UV-induced skin cancers earlier and more frequently compared to wild-type mice. The relevance of these experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown. No effects on fertility were observed in male cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ustekinumab at subcutaneous doses up to 45 mg/kg twice weekly (45 times the MRHD on a mg/kg basis) prior to and during the mating period. However, fertility and pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated in mated females.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u226512, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trials. Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The trials had the same design through Week 28. In both trials, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of Ustekinumab. Subjects randomized to Ustekinumab received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive Ustekinumab (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16. In both trials, subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18. Baseline PGA score was marked or severe in 44% of subjects in Ps STUDY 1 and 40% of subjects in Ps STUDY 2. Approximately two-thirds of all subjects had received prior phototherapy, 69% had received either prior conventional systemic or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, with 56% receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 43% receiving prior biologic therapy. A total of 28% of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis. In both trials, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a 6-category scale ranging from 0 (cleared) to 5 (severe) that indicates the physician's overall assessment of psoriasis focusing on plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling. Clinical Response The results of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 are presented in Table 8 below. Table 8: Clinical Outcomes at Week 12 in Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response 8 (3%) 171 (67%) 170 (66%) 15 (4%) 273 (67%) 311 (76%) PGA of Cleared or Minimal 10 (4%) 151 (59%) 156 (61%) 18 (4%) 277 (68%) 300 (73%) Examination of age, gender, and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to Ustekinumab among these subgroups. In subjects who weighed 100 kg or less, response rates were comparable with both the 45 mg and 90 mg doses; however, in subjects who weighed greater than 100 kg, higher response rates were seen with 90 mg dosing compared with 45 mg dosing (Table 9 below). Table 9: Clinical Outcomes by Weight at Week 12 in Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response Subjects were dosed with trial medication at Weeks 0 and 4. \u2264100 kg 4% 74% 65% 4% 73% 78% 6/166 124/168 107/164 12/290 218/297 225/289 >100 kg 2% 54% 68% 3% 49% 71% 2/89 47/87 63/92 3/120 55/112 86/121 PGA of Cleared or Minimal \u2264100 kg 4% 64% 63% 5% 74% 75% 7/166 108/168 103/164 14/290 220/297 216/289 >100 kg 3% 49% 58% 3% 51% 69% 3/89 43/87 53/92 4/120 57/112 84/121 Subjects in Ps STUDY 1 who were PASI 75 responders at both Weeks 28 and 40 were re-randomized at Week 40 to either continued dosing of Ustekinumab (Ustekinumab at Week 40) or to withdrawal of therapy (placebo at Week 40). At Week 52, 89% (144/162) of subjects re-randomized to Ustekinumab treatment were PASI 75 responders compared with 63% (100/159) of subjects re-randomized to placebo (treatment withdrawal after Week 28 dose). The median time to loss of PASI 75 response among the subjects randomized to treatment withdrawal was 16 weeks. 14.2 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis A multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (Ps STUDY 3) enrolled 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with a minimum BSA involvement of 10%, a PASI score greater than or equal to 12, and a PGA score greater than or equal to 3, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37), the recommended dose of Ustekinumab (n = 36), or one-half the recommended dose of Ustekinumab (n = 37) by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by dosing every 12 weeks (q12w). The recommended dose of Ustekinumab was 0.75 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 60 kg, 45 mg for subjects weighing 60 kg to 100 kg, and 90 mg for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg. At Week 12, subjects who received placebo were crossed over to receive Ustekinumab at the recommended dose or one-half the recommended dose. Of the pediatric subjects, approximately 63% had prior exposure to phototherapy or conventional systemic therapy and approximately 11% had prior exposure to biologics. The endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1), PASI 75, and PASI 90 at Week 12. Subjects were followed for up to 60 weeks following first administration of trial agent. Clinical Response The efficacy results at Week 12 for Ps STUDY 3 are presented in Table 10. Table 10: Efficacy Results at Week 12 in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 3 Ps STUDY 3 Placebo n (%) Ustekinumab Using the weight-based dosage regimen specified in Table 1 and Table 2. n (%) N 37 36 PGA PGA of cleared (0) or minimal (1) 2 (5.4%) 25 (69.4%) PASI PASI 75 responders 4 (10.8%) 29 (80.6%) PASI 90 responders 2 (5.4%) 22 (61.1%) 14.3 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of Ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects (PsA STUDY 1, n=615; PsA STUDY 2, n=312), in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult subjects 18 years of age and older with active PsA (\u22655 swollen joints and \u22655 tender joints) despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) or disease modifying antirheumatic (DMARD) therapy. Subjects in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. Subjects with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules (39%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (28%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (21%), distal interphalangeal involvement (12%) and arthritis mutilans (0.5%). Over 70% and 40% of the patients, respectively, had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with Ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of subjects continued on stable doses of MTX (\u226425 mg/week). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24. In PsA STUDY 1 and PsA STUDY 2, 80% and 86% of the subjects, respectively, had been previously treated with DMARDs. In PsA STUDY 1, previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 agent was not allowed. In PsA STUDY 2, 58% (n=180) of the subjects had been previously treated with TNF blocker, of whom over 70% had discontinued their TNF blocker treatment for lack of efficacy or intolerance at any time. Clinical Response In both trials, a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the Ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (see Table 11 ). ACR 70 responses were also higher in the Ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, although the difference was only numerical (p=NS) in STUDY 2. Responses were consistent in subjects treated with Ustekinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate. Responses were similar in subjects regardless of prior TNF\u03b1 exposure.

Physical Function Ustekinumab-treated subjects showed improvement in physical function compared to subjects receiving placebo as assessed by HAQ-DI at Week 24. In both trials, the proportion of HAQ-DI responders (\u22650.3 improvement in HAQ-DI score) was greater in the Ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24. Figure 1 14.4 Crohn's Disease Ustekinumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction trials (CD-1 and CD-2) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (CD-3) representing 52 weeks of therapy. Subjects in CD-1 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers, while subjects in CD-2 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed treatment with a TNF blocker. Trials CD-1 and CD-2 In trials CD-1 and CD-2, 1409 subjects were randomized, of whom 1368 (CD-1, n=741; CD-2, n=627) were included in the final efficacy analysis. Induction of clinical response (defined as a reduction in CDAI score of greater than or equal to 100 points or CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 6 and clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 8 were evaluated. In both trials, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous administration of Ustekinumab at either approximately 6 mg/kg, placebo (see Table 4 ), or 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended). In trial CD-1, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with a TNF blocker: 29% subjects had an inadequate initial response (primary non-responders), 69% responded but subsequently lost response (secondary non-responders) and 36% were intolerant to a TNF blocker. Of these subjects, 48% failed or were intolerant to one TNF blocker and 52% had failed 2 or 3 prior TNF blockers. At baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 46% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 31% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 319 in the Ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg group and 313 in the placebo group. In trial CD-2, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with corticosteroids (81% of subjects), at least one immunomodulator (6-MP, AZA, MTX; 68% of subjects), or both (49% of subjects). Additionally, 69% never received a TNF blocker and 31% previously received but had not failed a TNF blocker. At baseline, and throughout the trial, approximately 39% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 35% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 286 in the Ustekinumab and 290 in the placebo group. In these induction trials, a greater proportion of subjects treated with Ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) achieved clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remission at Week 8 compared to placebo (see Table 13 for clinical response and remission rates). Clinical response and remission were significant as early as Week 3 in Ustekinumab-treated subjects and continued to improve through Week 8. Table 13: Induction of Clinical Response and Remission in CD-1 Patient population consisted of subjects who failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapy and CD-2 Patient population consisted of subjects who failed or were intolerant to corticosteroids or immunomodulators (e.g., 6-MP, AZA, MTX) and previously received but not failed a TNF blocker or were never treated with a TNF blocker.

Subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg Ustekinumab every 8 weeks or placebo for 44 weeks (see Table 14 ). Table 14: Clinical Response and Remission In CD-3 (Week 44; 52 Weeks From Initiation Of Induction Dose) Placebo The placebo group consisted of subjects who were in response to Ustekinumab and were randomized to receive placebo at the start of maintenance therapy. 90 mg Ustekinumab every 8 weeks Treatment difference and 95% CI N = 131 Subjects who achieved clinical response to Ustekinumab at the end of the induction trial.

This does not account for any other time point during maintenance therapy. 36/79 (46%) 52/78 (67%) 21% (6%, 36%) At Week 44, 47% of subjects who received Ustekinumab were corticosteroid-free and in clinical remission, compared to 30% of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 34/56 (61%) Ustekinumab-treated subjects who previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapies were in clinical remission and 23/56 (41%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 27/61 (44%) subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 16/61 (26%) of these subjects were in remission at Week 44. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 46/72 (64%) Ustekinumab-treated subjects who had previously failed immunomodulator therapy or corticosteroids (but not TNF blockers) were in clinical remission and 45/72 (63%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 50/70 (71%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 31/70 (44%) were in remission at Week 44. In the subset of these subjects who were also na\u00efve to TNF blockers, 34/52 (65%) of Ustekinumab-treated subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44 as compared to 25/51 (49%) in the placebo arm. Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after Ustekinumab induction were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial CD-3; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of Ustekinumab upon entry into trial CD-3. Of these subjects, 102/219 (47%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later and were followed for the duration of the trial. 14.5 Ulcerative Colitis Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [UC-1 and UC-2 (NCT02407236)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate a biologic (i.e., TNF blocker and/or vedolizumab), corticosteroids, and/or 6-MP or AZA therapy. The 8-week intravenous induction trial (UC-1) was followed by the 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (UC-2) for a total of 52 weeks of therapy. Disease assessment was based on the Mayo score, which ranged from 0 to 12 and has four subscores that were each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally-reviewed endoscopy, and physician global assessment. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was defined at baseline (Week 0) as Mayo score of 6 to 12, including a Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22652. An endoscopy score of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; and a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding, ulceration. At baseline, subjects had a median Mayo score of 9, with 84% of subjects having moderate disease (Mayo score 6\u201310) and 15% having severe disease (Mayo score 11\u201312). Subjects in these trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and oral corticosteroids (prednisone). Trial UC-1 In UC-1, 961 subjects were randomized at Week 0 to a single intravenous administration of Ustekinumab of approximately 6 mg/kg, 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo. Subjects enrolled in UC-1 had to have failed therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or at least one biologic. A total of 51% had failed at least one biologic and 17% had failed both a TNF blocker and an integrin receptor blocker. Of the total population, 46% had failed corticosteroids or immunomodulators but were biologic-na\u00efve and an additional 3% had previously received but had not failed a biologic. At induction baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 52% subjects were receiving oral corticosteroids, 28% subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) and 69% subjects were receiving aminosalicylates. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission with a definition of: Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal bleeding), and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and Mayo subscore of 1 defined as presence of erythema, decreased vascular pattern and no friability) is provided in Table 15. The secondary endpoints were clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical response with a definition of (\u2265 2 points and \u2265 30% decrease in modified Mayo score, defined as 3-component Mayo score without the Physician's Global Assessment, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), endoscopic improvement with a definition of Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement with a definition of combined endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement of the colon tissue [neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue] are provided in Table 15. In UC-1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with Ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) were in clinical remission and response and achieved endoscopic improvement and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement compared to placebo (see Table 15 ). Table 15: Proportion of Subjects Meeting Efficacy Endpoints at Week 8 in UC-1 Endpoint Placebo N = 319 Ustekinumab Infusion dose of Ustekinumab using the weight-based dosage regimen specified in Table 4. N = 322 Treatment difference and 97.5% CI Adjusted treatment difference (97.5% CI) N % N % Clinical Remission Clinical remission was defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 22 7% 62 19% 12% (7%, 18%) p < 0.001 Bio-na\u00efve An additional 7 subjects on placebo and 9 subjects on Ustekinumab (6 mg/kg) had been exposed to, but had not failed, biologics. 14/151 9% 36/147 24% Prior biologic failure 7/161 4% 24/166 14% Endoscopic Improvement Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 40 13% 80 25% 12% (6%, 19%) Bio-na\u00efve 28/151 19% 43/147 29% Prior biologic failure 11/161 7% 34/166 20% Clinical Response Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score by \u226530% and \u22652 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 99 31% 186 58% 27% (18%, 35%) Bio-na\u00efve 55/151 36% 94/147 64% Prior biologic failure 42/161 26% 86/166 52% Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement Histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement was defined as combined endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1) and histologic improvement of the colon tissue (neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue). 26 8% 54 17% 9% (3%, 14%) Bio-na\u00efve 19/151 13% 30/147 20% Prior biologic failure 6/161 4% 21/166 13% The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-1, at Week 8 to disease progression and long-term outcomes was not evaluated during UC-1. Rectal Bleeding and Stool Frequency Subscores Decreases in rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores were observed as early as Week 2 in Ustekinumab-treated subjects. Trial UC-2 The maintenance trial (UC-2) evaluated 523 subjects who achieved clinical response 8 weeks following the intravenous administration of either induction dose of Ustekinumab in UC-1. These subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg Ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or every 12 weeks (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo for 44 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical response at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 44, and the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction. Results of the primary and secondary endpoints at Week 44 in subjects treated with Ustekinumab at the recommended dosage (90 mg every 8 weeks) compared to the placebo are shown in Table 16. Table 16: Efficacy Endpoints of Maintenance at Week 44 in UC-2 (52 Weeks from Initiation of the Induction Dose) Endpoint Placebo The placebo group consisted of subjects who were in response to Ustekinumab and were randomized to receive placebo at the start of maintenance therapy. N = 175 Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score by \u226530% and \u22652 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 90 mg Ustekinumab every 8 weeks N = 176 Treatment difference and 95% CI N % N % Clinical Remission Clinical remission was defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 46 26% 79 45% 19% (9%, 28%) p =<0.001 Bio-na\u00efve An additional 3 subjects on placebo and 6 subjects on Ustekinumab had been exposed to, but had not failed, biologics. 30/84 36% 39/79 49% Prior biologic failure 16/88 18% 37/91 41% Maintenance of Clinical Response at Week 44 84 48% 130 74% 26% (16%, 36%) Bio-na\u00efve 49/84 58% 62/79 78% Prior biologic failure 35/88 40% 64/91 70% Endoscopic Improvement Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 47 27% 83 47% 20% (11%, 30%) Bio-na\u00efve 29/84 35% 42/79 53% Prior biologic failure 18/88 20% 38/91 42% Corticosteroid-free Clinical Remission Corticosteroid-free clinical remission was defined as subjects in clinical remission and not receiving corticosteroids at Week 44. 45 26% 76 43% 17% (8%, 27%) Bio-na\u00efve 30/84 36% 38/79 48% Prior biologic failure 15/88 17% 35/91 38% Maintenance of Clinical Remission at Week 44 in subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction 18/50 36% 27/41 66% 31% (12%, 50%) p=0.004 Bio-na\u00efve 12/27 44% 14/20 70% Prior biologic failure 6/23 26% 12/18 67% Other Endpoints Week 16 Responders to Ustekinumab Induction Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after induction with Ustekinumab in UC-1 were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial UC-2; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of Ustekinumab at Week 8. Of these subjects, 55/101 (54%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later (Week 16) and received Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks during the UC-2 trial. At Week 44, there were 97/157 (62%) subjects who maintained clinical response and there were 51/157 (32%) who achieved clinical remission. Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement at Week 44 The proportion of subjects achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement during maintenance treatment in UC-2 was 75/172 (44%) among subjects on Ustekinumab and 40/172 (23%) in subjects on placebo at Week 44. The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-2, at Week 44 to progression of disease or long-term outcomes was not evaluated in UC-2. Endoscopic Normalization Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. At Week 8 in UC-1, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 25/322 (8%) of subjects treated with Ustekinumab and 12/319 (4%) of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 44 of UC-2, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 51/176 (29%) of subjects treated with Ustekinumab and in 32/175 (18%) of subjects in placebo group."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Ustekinumab (y\u00fc-st\u0259-kin-\u00fc-mab) injection, for subcutaneous use This Instructions for Use contains information on how to inject Ustekinumab using a prefilled syringe. Read this Instructions for Use before you start using Ustekinumab. A healthcare provider should show you how to prepare and give an injection of Ustekinumab the right way. If you cannot give the injection: ask your healthcare provider to help you, or ask someone who has been trained by a healthcare provider to give your injections. Do not try to inject Ustekinumab until you have been shown how to inject Ustekinumab by a healthcare provider. Important information You Need to Know Before Injecting Ustekinumab: For subcutaneous use only (inject directly under the skin). Before you start, check the carton to make sure that it is the right dose. You will have either 45 mg or 90 mg as prescribed by the healthcare provider. If the dose is 45 mg, you will receive one 45 mg prefilled syringe. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give two injections, one right after the other. Check the expiration date on the prefilled syringe and carton. If the expiration date has passed or if the prefilled syringe has been kept at room temperature up to 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) for longer than a maximum single period of 30 days or if the prefilled syringe has been stored above 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C), do not use it. If the expiration date has passed or if the prefilled syringe has been stored above 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) or at room temperature for longer than 30 days, call the healthcare provider or pharmacist, or call 1-800-526-7736 for help. Make sure the syringe is not damaged. The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains latex. Do not handle the needle cover on the Ustekinumab prefilled syringe if you are allergic to latex. Check the prefilled syringe for any particles or discoloration. The liquid in the prefilled syringe should look clear and colorless to light yellow with a few small clear or white particles. Do not use if it is frozen, discolored, cloudy or has large particles. Get a new prefilled syringe. Do not shake the prefilled syringe at any time. Shaking the prefilled syringe may damage the Ustekinumab medicine. If the prefilled syringe has been shaken, do not use it. Get a new prefilled syringe. To reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks, each prefilled syringe has a needle guard that is automatically activated to cover the needle after you have given the injection. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Storing Ustekinumab prefilled syringes Store Ustekinumab prefilled syringes in the refrigerator between 36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C). Store Ustekinumab prefilled syringes in the original carton to protect from light. Do not freeze Ustekinumab prefilled syringes. If needed, Ustekinumab prefilled syringe may be stored at room temperature up to 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) for a maximum single period of up to 30 days in the original carton to protect from light. Record the date when the prefilled syringe is removed from the refrigerator on the carton in the space provided. After a prefilled syringe has been stored at room temperature, do not return it to the refrigerator. Throw away (discard) the prefilled syringe if it is not used within 30 days at room temperature storage. Keep Ustekinumab and all medicines out of the reach of children. Gather the supplies you will need to prepare and to give the injection. (See Figure A ) You will need: antiseptic wipes cotton balls or gauze pads adhesive bandage your prescribed dose of Ustekinumab (See Figure B ) FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" Step 4: Disposing of the syringes \" Figure A Figure B To prevent early activation of the needle safety guard, do not touch the NEEDLE GUARD ACTIVATION CLIPS at any time during use. Step 1: Preparing the injection Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Hold the prefilled syringe with the covered needle pointing upward. Step 2: Preparing the injection site Choose an injection site around the stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. (See Figure C ) Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard. Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give the injection. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let the skin dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Figure C *Areas in gray are recommended injection sites. Step 3: Injecting Ustekinumab Remove the needle cover when you are ready to inject Ustekinumab. Do not touch the plunger or plunger head while removing the needle cover. Hold the body of the prefilled syringe with one hand and pull the needle cover straight off. (see Figure D ) Put the needle cover in the trash. You may also see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. Do not touch the needle or let it touch anything. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the needle cover in place. Figure D Hold the body of the prefilled syringe in one hand between the thumb and index fingers. (See Figure E ) Figure E Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure F ) Figure F Inject all of the liquid by using your thumb to push in the plunger until the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. (See Figure G ) Figure G When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, keep pressure on the plunger head. Take the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. Slowly take your thumb off the plunger head. This will let the empty syringe move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard. (See Figure H ) Figure H When the needle is pulled out of the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the second injection using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 4: Disposing of the syringes Put the syringe in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) syringes in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Prefilled Syringe Manufactured by: Janssen Biotech, Inc., Horsham, PA 19044, USA.

See \" Step 6: Disposing of needles, syringes, and vials. \" Do not re-use syringes or needles. To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap needles. Storing Ustekinumab vials Store Ustekinumab vials in a refrigerator between 36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C). Store Ustekinumab vials standing up straight (upright). Store Ustekinumab vials in the original carton to protect from light until the time of use. Do not freeze Ustekinumab vials. Keep Ustekinumab and all medicines out of the reach of children. Gather the supplies you will need to prepare Ustekinumab and to give your injection. (See Figure A ) You will need: a syringe with the needle attached, you will need a prescription from a healthcare provider to get syringes with the needles attached from a pharmacy. antiseptic wipes cotton balls or gauze pads adhesive bandage your prescribed dose of Ustekinumab FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" Step 6: Disposing of needles, syringes, and vials. \" Figure A Step 1: Preparing the injection. Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Step 2: Preparing your injection site Choose an injection site around your stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, and upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving you the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. (See Figure B ) Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard. Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give the injection. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let the skin dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Figure B *Areas in gray are recommended injection sites. Step 3: Preparing the vial Remove the cap from the top of the vial. Throw away the cap but do not remove the rubber stopper. (See Figure C ) Figure C Clean the rubber stopper with an antiseptic wipe. (See Figure D ) Figure D Do not touch the rubber stopper after you clean it. Put the vial on a flat surface. Step 4: Preparing the syringe Pick up the syringe with the needle attached. Remove the cap that covers the needle. (See Figure E ) Throw the needle cap away. Do not touch the needle or allow the needle to touch anything. Figure E Carefully pull back on the plunger to the line that matches the dose prescribed by the healthcare provider. Hold the vial between your thumb and index (pointer) finger. Use your other hand to push the syringe needle through the center of the rubber stopper. (See Figure F ) Figure F Push down on the plunger until all of the air has gone from the syringe into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down. (See Figure G ) Hold the Ustekinumab vial with one hand. It is important that the needle is always in the liquid in order to prevent air bubbles forming in the syringe. Pull back on the syringe plunger with your other hand. Fill the syringe until the black tip of the plunger lines up with the mark that matches the prescribed dose. Figure G Do not remove the needle from the vial. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up to see if it has any air bubbles inside. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the side of the syringe until the air bubbles rise to the top. (See Figure H ) Slowly press the plunger up until all of the air bubbles are out of the syringe (but none of the liquid is out). Remove the syringe from the vial. Do not lay the syringe down or allow the needle to touch anything. Figure H Step 5: Injecting Ustekinumab Hold the barrel of the syringe in one hand, between the thumb and index fingers. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure I ) Figure I Push the plunger with your thumb as far as it will go to inject all of the liquid. Push it slowly and evenly, keeping the skin gently pinched. When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. (See Figure J ) Figure J When the needle is pulled out of the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive two 45 mg vials and you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 5 using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 6: Disposing of the needles, syringes, and vials Do not re-use a syringe or needle. To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap a needle. Put the needles and syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. Throw away the vial into the container where you put the syringes and needles. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

USTEKINUMAB-TTWE should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that USTEKINUMAB-TTWE be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27 gauge, \u00bd inch needle is recommended. Prior to administration, visually inspect USTEKINUMAB-TTWE for particulate matter and discoloration. USTEKINUMAB-TTWE is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile and preservative-free solution. Do not use USTEKINUMAB-TTWE if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. USTEKINUMAB-TTWE does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) USTEKINUMAB-TTWE solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-ttwe. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used. Withdraw 26 mL of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Protect from light. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted in the infusion bag, the infusion should be completely administered within 36 hours at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) . Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse USTEKINUMAB-TTWE concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. USTEKINUMAB-TTWE does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage The diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) for up to 36 hours including infusion period. If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be stored refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 15 days. After removal from refrigeration, the diluted solution may be stored at room temperature at up to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) for an additional 24 hours including infusion period. Storage time at refrigerated or room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. Do not freeze. Protect from light. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections : Serious infections have occurred. Avoid starting USTEKINUMAB-TTWE during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection or clinically significant infection develops, discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE until the infection resolves. ( 5.1 ) Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections : Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23. Consider diagnostic tests for these infections as dictated by clinical circumstances. ( 5.2 ) Tuberculosis (TB) : Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. ( 5.3 ) Malignancies : Ustekinumab products may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of ustekinumab products in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions : If a severe or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) : If PRES is suspected, treat promptly and discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. ( 5.6 ) Immunizations : Avoid use of live vaccines in patients during treatment with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. ( 5.7 ) Noninfectious Pneumonia: Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infections Ustekinumab products may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3) ] . Serious infections requiring hospitalization, or otherwise clinically significant infections, reported in clinical trials included the following: Plaque Psoriasis : diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections. Psoriatic arthritis : cholecystitis. Crohn's disease : anal abscess, gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeria meningitis. Ulcerative colitis : gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeriosis. Avoid initiating treatment with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. 5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with ustekinumab products may be susceptible to these types of infections. Consider appropriate diagnostic testing (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances). 5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. Avoid administering USTEKINUMAB-TTWE to patients with active tuberculosis infection. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving USTEKINUMAB-TTWE for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment. 5.4 Malignancies Ustekinumab products are immunosuppressants and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received ustekinumab in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) ] . The safety of ustekinumab products has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving ustekinumab products who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer. Monitor all patients receiving USTEKINUMAB-TTWE for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Closely follow patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.5 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with ustekinumab products in clinical trials and postmarketing. Some serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during the first intravenous dose of ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3) ] . If a severe or clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab product initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab products. Monitor all patients treated with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. 5.7 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with USTEKINUMAB-TTWE or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving USTEKINUMAB-TTWE because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. 5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and institute appropriate treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] ."

( 6.1 ) Crohn's Disease, induction (\u22653%): vomiting. ( 6.1 ) Crohn's Disease, maintenance (\u22653%): nasopharyngitis, injection site erythema, vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection, bronchitis, pruritus, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis. ( 6.1 ) Ulcerative colitis, induction (\u22653%): nasopharyngitis ( 6.1 ) Ulcerative colitis, maintenance (\u22653%): nasopharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, influenza, fever, diarrhea, sinusitis, fatigue, and nausea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Quallent Pharmaceuticals Health LLC at 1-877-605-7243 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22651% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the Ustekinumab Groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for subjects receiving placebo and 13.4 weeks for ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of subjects receiving placebo (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects receiving placebo (0.02 per patient-year of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo- treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn's Disease The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6- mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. Table 6: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo N=466 Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 Occurring in \u22653% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo N=133 Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn's disease clinical trials, 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient-years) developed non- melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following ustekinumab administration. One subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Ulcerative Colitis The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs. 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non- melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of subjects receiving placebo (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In clinical trials in subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ustekinumab product exposure. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, urticaria), including a fatal case that presented with chest tightness and dyspnea during infusion of the first dose . Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) . Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia . Skin reactions: Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Therapies In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis the safety of ustekinumab products in combination with immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. In trials in subjects with Crohn's disease (CD-1 and CD-2) and ulcerative colitis (UC-1), immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, MTX) were used concomitantly in approximately 30% of subjects and corticosteroids were used concomitantly in approximately 40% and 50% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis subjects, respectively. Use of these concomitant therapies did not appear to influence the overall safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. 7.2 CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, use of ustekinumab products, antagonists of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and adjust the individual dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates. A CYP-mediated drug interaction effect was not observed in subjects with Crohn's disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry, published literature and pharmacovigilance in pregnant women have not identified a ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in pregnancy. In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring after administration of ustekinumab to pregnant monkeys at exposures greater than 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Transport of endogenous IgG antibodies across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses, and peaks during the third trimester. Therefore, ustekinumab products may be present in infants exposed in utero . The potential clinical impact of ustekinumab product exposure in infants exposed in utero should be considered. Data Human Data An observational pregnancy registry conducted by (OTIS)/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada (enrollment between 2013 and 2019) assessed the risk of major birth defects, pattern of major and minor anomalies in live-born infants, miscarriage, and adverse infant outcomes in women with ustekinumab exposure. In the registry study, there were 101 participants and 107 pregnancies with exposure to ustekinumab (88 prospective; 19 retrospective). Most participants had a primary indication of CD (65.4%) or psoriasis (30.8%). The pregnancy registry did not identify a ustekinumab-associated risk of major birth defects, pattern of major or minor anomalies, increased risk of miscarriage or adverse infant outcomes. Methodological limitations of the registry include small sample size, lack of an internal comparison group, a mix of prospective and retrospective reports, and unmeasured confounders. The conclusions from the pregnancy registry were consistent with the published literature and pharmacovigilance. Animal Data Ustekinumab was tested in two embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No teratogenic or other adverse developmental effects were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered ustekinumab subcutaneously twice weekly or intravenously weekly during the period of organogenesis. Serum concentrations of ustekinumab in pregnant monkeys were greater than 100 times the serum concentration in patients treated subcutaneously with 90 mg of ustekinumab weekly for 4 weeks. In a combined embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab twice weekly at exposures greater than 100 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to Day 33 after delivery. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one monkey administered ustekinumab at 22.5 mg/kg and one monkey dosed at 45 mg/kg. No ustekinumab-related effects on functional, morphological, or immunological development were observed in the neonates from birth through six months of age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from published literature suggests that ustekinumab is present in human breast milk. There are no available data on the effects of ustekinumab products on milk production. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to ustekinumab products are unknown. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant causally related to ustekinumab products have been identified in the published literature or postmarketing experience. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from USTEKINUMAB-TTWE or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Plaque Psoriasis The safety and effectiveness of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE have been established for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Use of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in pediatric patients 12 to less than 17 years of age is supported by evidence from a multicenter, randomized, 60 week trial (Ps STUDY 3) of ustekinumab that included a 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group portion, in 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Use of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from an open- label, single-arm, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics trial (Ps STUDY 4) of ustekinumab in 44 subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE have been established for treatment of psoriatic arthritis in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of ustekinumab in adult subjects with psoriasis and PsA, pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and safety data of ustekinumab from two clinical trials in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old with psoriasis and 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with psoriasis. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and the PK exposure is expected to be comparable between adult and pediatric subjects with PsA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years old with psoriatic arthritis. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis The safety and effectiveness of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 6709 subjects exposed to ustekinumab, a total of 340 were 65 years of age or older (183 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 65 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 58 subjects with Crohn's disease and 34 subjects with ulcerative colitis), and 40 subjects were 75 years of age or older. Clinical trials of ustekinumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell- surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plaque Psoriasis In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1 SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn's disease [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

The mean (\u00b1SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1 SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady-state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, the observed steady-state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn's disease [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

Published literature showed that administration of murine IL-12 caused an anti-tumor effect in mice that contained transplanted tumors and IL-12/IL- 23p40 knockout mice or mice treated with anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody had decreased host defense to tumors. Mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL- 23 or IL-12 alone developed UV-induced skin cancers earlier and more frequently compared to wild-type mice. The relevance of these experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown. No effects on fertility were observed in male cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ustekinumab at subcutaneous doses up to 45 mg/kg twice weekly (45 times the MRHD on a mg/kg basis) prior to and during the mating period. However, fertility and pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated in mated females. No effects on fertility were observed in female mice that were administered an analogous IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody by subcutaneous administration at doses up to 50 mg/kg, twice weekly, prior to and during early pregnancy. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In a 26-week toxicology study, one out of 10 monkeys subcutaneously administered 45 mg/kg ustekinumab twice weekly for 26 weeks had a bacterial infection."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u226512, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trials. Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The trials had the same design through Week 28. In both trials, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of ustekinumab. Subjects randomized to ustekinumab received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive ustekinumab (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16. In both trials, subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18. Baseline PGA score was marked or severe in 44% of subjects in Ps STUDY 1 and 40% of subjects in Ps STUDY 2. Approximately two-thirds of all subjects had received prior phototherapy, 69% had received either prior conventional systemic or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, with 56% receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 43% receiving prior biologic therapy. A total of 28% of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis. In both trials, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a 6- category scale ranging from 0 (cleared) to 5 (severe) that indicates the physician's overall assessment of psoriasis focusing on plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling. Clinical Response The results of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 are presented in Table 8 below. Table 8: Clinical Outcomes at Week 12 in Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response 8 (3%) 171 (67%) 170 (66%) 15 (4%) 273 (67%) 311 (76%) PGA of Cleared or Minimal 10 (4%) 151 (59%) 156 (61%) 18 (4%) 277 (68%) 300 (73%) Examination of age, gender, and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to ustekinumab among these subgroups. In subjects who weighed 100 kg or less, response rates were comparable with both the 45 mg and 90 mg doses; however, in subjects who weighed greater than 100 kg, higher response rates were seen with 90 mg dosing compared with 45 mg dosing (Table 9 below). Table 9: Clinical Outcomes by Weight at Week 12 in Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response Subjects were dosed with trial medication at Weeks 0 and 4. \u2264100 kg 4% 74% 65% 4% 73% 78% 6/166 124/168 107/164 12/290 218/297 225/289 >100 kg 2% 54% 68% 3% 49% 71% 2/89 47/87 63/92 3/120 55/112 86/121 PGA of Cleared or Minimal \u2264100 kg 4% 64% 63% 5% 74% 75% 7/166 108/168 103/164 14/290 220/297 216/289 >100 kg 3% 49% 58% 3% 51% 69% 3/89 43/87 53/92 4/120 57/112 84/121 Subjects in Ps STUDY 1 who were PASI 75 responders at both Weeks 28 and 40 were re-randomized at Week 40 to either continued dosing of ustekinumab (ustekinumab at Week 40) or to withdrawal of therapy (placebo at Week 40). At Week 52, 89% (144/162) of subjects re-randomized to ustekinumab treatment were PASI 75 responders compared with 63% (100/159) of subjects re-randomized to placebo (treatment withdrawal after Week 28 dose). The median time to loss of PASI 75 response among the subjects randomized to treatment withdrawal was 16 weeks. 14.2 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis A multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (Ps STUDY 3) enrolled 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with a minimum BSA involvement of 10%, a PASI score greater than or equal to 12, and a PGA score greater than or equal to 3, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37), the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 36), or one-half the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 37) by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by dosing every 12 weeks (q12w). The recommended dose of ustekinumab was 0.75 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 60 kg, 45 mg for subjects weighing 60 kg to 100 kg, and 90 mg for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg. At Week 12, subjects who received placebo were crossed over to receive ustekinumab at the recommended dose or one-half the recommended dose. Of the pediatric subjects, approximately 63% had prior exposure to phototherapy or conventional systemic therapy and approximately 11% had prior exposure to biologics. The endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1), PASI 75, and PASI 90 at Week 12. Subjects were followed for up to 60 weeks following first administration of trial agent. Clinical Response The efficacy results at Week 12 for Ps STUDY 3 are presented in Table 10. Table 10: Efficacy Results at Week 12 in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 3 Ps STUDY 3 Placebo n (%) Ustekinumab Using the weight-based dosage regimen specified in Table 1 and Table 2. n (%) N 37 36 PGA PGA of cleared (0) or minimal (1) 2 (5.4%) 25 (69.4%) PASI PASI 75 responders 4 (10.8%) 29 (80.6%) PASI 90 responders 2 (5.4%) 22 (61.1%) 14.3 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects (PsA STUDY 1, n=615; PsA STUDY 2, n=312), in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult subjects 18 years of age and older with active PsA (\u22655 swollen joints and \u22655 tender joints) despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) or disease modifying antirheumatic (DMARD) therapy. Subjects in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. Subjects with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules (39%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (28%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (21%), distal interphalangeal involvement (12%) and arthritis mutilans (0.5%). Over 70% and 40% of the subjects, respectively, had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of subjects continued on stable doses of MTX (\u226425 mg/week). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24. In PsA STUDY 1 and PsA STUDY 2, 80% and 86% of the subjects, respectively, had been previously treated with DMARDs. In PsA STUDY 1, previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 agent was not allowed. In PsA STUDY 2, 58% (n=180) of the subjects had been previously treated with TNF blocker, of whom over 70% had discontinued their TNF blocker treatment for lack of efficacy or intolerance at any time. Clinical Response In both trials, a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (see Table 11 ). ACR 70 responses were also higher in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, although the difference was only numerical (p=NS) in STUDY 2. Responses were consistent in subjects treated with ustekinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate. Responses were similar in subjects regardless of prior TNF\u03b1 exposure.

Physical Function Ustekinumab-treated subjects showed improvement in physical function compared to subjects receiving placebo as assessed by HAQ-DI at Week 24. In both trials, the proportion of HAQ-DI responders (\u22650.3 improvement in HAQ-DI score) was greater in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24. Figure 1 14.4 Crohn's Disease Ustekinumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction trials (CD-1 and CD-2) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (CD-3) representing 52 weeks of therapy. Subjects in CD- 1 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers, while subjects in CD-2 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed treatment with a TNF blocker. Trials CD-1 and CD-2 In trials CD-1 and CD-2, 1409 subjects were randomized, of whom 1368 (CD-1, n=741; CD-2, n=627) were included in the final efficacy analysis. Induction of clinical response (defined as a reduction in CDAI score of greater than or equal to 100 points or CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 6 and clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 8 were evaluated. In both trials, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab at either approximately 6 mg/kg, placebo (see Table 4 ), or 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended). In trial CD-1, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with a TNF blocker: 29% subjects had an inadequate initial response (primary non-responders), 69% responded but subsequently lost response (secondary non-responders) and 36% were intolerant to a TNF blocker. Of these subjects, 48% failed or were intolerant to one TNF blocker and 52% had failed 2 or 3 prior TNF blockers. At baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 46% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 31% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 319 in the ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg group and 313 in the placebo group. In trial CD-2, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with corticosteroids (81% of subjects), at least one immunomodulator (6-MP, AZA, MTX; 68% of subjects), or both (49% of subjects). Additionally, 69% never received a TNF blocker and 31% previously received but had not failed a TNF blocker. At baseline, and throughout the trial, approximately 39% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 35% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 286 in the ustekinumab and 290 in the placebo group. In these induction trials, a greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) achieved clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remission at Week 8 compared to placebo (see Table 13 for clinical response and remission rates). Clinical response and remission were significant as early as Week 3 in ustekinumab-treated subjects and continued to improve through Week 8. Table 13: Induction of Clinical Response and Remission in CD-1 Patient population consisted of subjects who failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapy and CD-2 Patient population consisted of subjects who failed or were intolerant to corticosteroids or immunomodulators (e.g., 6-MP, AZA, MTX) and previously received but not failed a TNF blocker or were never treated with a TNF blocker.

Subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks or placebo for 44 weeks (see Table 14 ). Table 14: Clinical Response and Remission in CD-3 (Week 44; 52 weeks from initiation of the induction dose) Placebo The placebo group consisted of subjects who were in response to ustekinumab and were randomized to receive placebo at the start of maintenance therapy.

This does not account for any other time point during maintenance therapy. 36/79 (46%) 52/78 (67%) 21% (6%, 36%) At Week 44, 47% of subjects who received ustekinumab were corticosteroid-free and in clinical remission, compared to 30% of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 34/56 (61%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapies were in clinical remission and 23/56 (41%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 27/61 (44%) subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 16/61 (26%) of these subjects were in remission at Week 44. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 46/72 (64%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who had previously failed immunomodulator therapy or corticosteroids (but not TNF blockers) were in clinical remission and 45/72 (63%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 50/70 (71%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 31/70 (44%) were in remission at Week 44. In the subset of these subjects who were also na\u00efve to TNF blockers, 34/52 (65%) of ustekinumab-treated subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44 as compared to 25/51 (49%) in the placebo arm. Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after ustekinumab induction were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial CD-3; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab upon entry into trial CD-3. Of these subjects, 102/219 (47%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later and were followed for the duration of the trial. 14.5 Ulcerative Colitis Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [UC-1 and UC-2 (NCT02407236)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate a biologic (i.e., TNF blocker and/or vedolizumab), corticosteroids, and/or 6-MP or AZA therapy. The 8-week intravenous induction trial (UC-1) was followed by the 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (UC-2) for a total of 52 weeks of therapy. Disease assessment was based on the Mayo score, which ranged from 0 to 12 and has four subscores that were each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally-reviewed endoscopy, and physician global assessment. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was defined at baseline (Week 0) as Mayo score of 6 to 12, including a Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22652. An endoscopy score of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; and a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding, ulceration. At baseline, subjects had a median Mayo score of 9, with 84% of subjects having moderate disease (Mayo score 6\u201310) and 15% having severe disease (Mayo score 11\u201312). Subjects in these trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and oral corticosteroids (prednisone). Trial UC-1 In UC-1, 961 subjects were randomized at Week 0 to a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab of approximately 6 mg/kg, 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo. Subjects enrolled in UC-1 had to have failed therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or at least one biologic. A total of 51% had failed at least one biologic and 17% had failed both a TNF blocker and an integrin receptor blocker. Of the total population, 46% had failed corticosteroids or immunomodulators but were biologic-na\u00efve and an additional 3% had previously received but had not failed a biologic. At induction baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 52% subjects were receiving oral corticosteroids, 28% subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) and 69% subjects were receiving aminosalicylates. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission with a definition of: Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal bleeding), and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and Mayo subscore of 1 defined as presence of erythema, decreased vascular pattern and no friability) is provided in Table 15. The secondary endpoints were clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical response with a definition of (\u2265 2 points and \u2265 30% decrease in modified Mayo score, defined as 3-component Mayo score without the Physician's Global Assessment, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), endoscopic improvement with a definition of Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, and histologic- endoscopic mucosal improvement with a definition of combined endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement of the colon tissue [neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue]) are provided in Table 15. In UC-1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) were in clinical remission and response and achieved endoscopic improvement and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement compared to placebo (see Table 15 ). Table 15: Proportion of Subjects Meeting Efficacy Endpoints at Week 8 in UC-1 Endpoint Placebo N = 319 Ustekinumab Infusion dose of ustekinumab using the weight-based dosage regimen specified in Table 4. N = 322 Treatment difference and 97.5% CI Adjusted treatment difference (97.5% CI) N % N % Clinical Remission Clinical remission was defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 22 7% 62 19% 12% (7%, 18%) p < 0.001 Bio-na\u00efve An additional 7 subjects on placebo and 9 subjects on ustekinumab (6 mg/kg) had been exposed to, but had not failed, biologics. 14/151 9% 36/147 24% Prior biologic failure 7/161 4% 24/166 14% Endoscopic Improvement Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 40 13% 80 25% 12% (6%, 19%) Bio-na\u00efve 28/151 19% 43/147 29% Prior biologic failure 11/161 7% 34/166 20% Clinical Response Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score by \u226530% and \u22652 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 99 31% 186 58% 27% (18%, 35%) Bio-na\u00efve 55/151 36% 94/147 64% Prior biologic failure 42/161 26% 86/166 52% Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement Histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement was defined as combined endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1) and histologic improvement of the colon tissue (neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue). 26 8% 54 17% 9% (3%, 14%) Bio-na\u00efve 19/151 13% 30/147 20% Prior biologic failure 6/161 4% 21/166 13% The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-1, at Week 8 to disease progression and long-term outcomes was not evaluated during UC-1. Rectal Bleeding and Stool Frequency Subscores Decreases in rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores were observed as early as Week 2 in ustekinumab-treated subjects. Trial UC-2 The maintenance trial (UC-2) evaluated 523 subjects who achieved clinical response 8 weeks following the intravenous administration of either induction dose of ustekinumab in UC-1. These subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or every 12 weeks (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo for 44 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical response at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 44, and the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction. Results of the primary and secondary endpoints at Week 44 in subjects treated with ustekinumab at the recommended dosage (90 mg every 8 weeks) compared to the placebo are shown in Table 16. Table 16: Efficacy Endpoints of Maintenance at Week 44 in UC-2 (52 Weeks from Initiation of the Induction Dose) Placebo The placebo group consisted of subjects who were in response to ustekinumab and were randomized to receive placebo at the start of maintenance therapy. N = 175 Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score by \u226530% and \u22652 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks N = 176 Treatment difference and 95% CI Endpoint N % N % Clinical Remission Clinical remission was defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 46 26% 79 45% 19% (9%, 28%) p =<0.001 Bio-na\u00efve An additional 3 subjects on placebo and 6 subjects on ustekinumab had been exposed to, but had not failed, biologics. 30/84 36% 39/79 49% Prior biologic failure 16/88 18% 37/91 41% Maintenance of Clinical Response at Week 44 84 48% 130 74% 26% (16%, 36%) Bio-na\u00efve 49/84 58% 62/79 78% Prior biologic failure 35/88 40% 64/91 70% Endoscopic Improvement Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). 47 27% 83 47% 20% (11%, 30%) Bio-na\u00efve 29/84 35% 42/79 53% Prior biologic failure 18/88 20% 38/91 42% Corticosteroid-free Clinical Remission Corticosteroid-free clinical remission was defined as subjects in clinical remission and not receiving corticosteroids at Week 44. 45 26% 76 43% 17% (8%, 27%) Bio-na\u00efve 30/84 36% 38/79 48% Prior biologic failure 15/88 17% 35/91 38% Maintenance of Clinical Remission at Week 44 in subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction 18/50 36% 27/41 66% 31% (12%, 50%) p=0.004 Bio-na\u00efve 12/27 44% 14/20 70% Prior biologic failure 6/23 26% 12/18 67% Other Endpoints Week 16 Responders to Ustekinumab Induction Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after induction with ustekinumab in UC- 1 were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial UC-2; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab at Week 8. Of these subjects, 55/101 (54%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later (Week 16) and received ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks during the UC-2 trial. At Week 44, there were 97/157 (62%) subjects who maintained clinical response and there were 51/157 (32%) who achieved clinical remission. Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement at Week 44 The proportion of subjects achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement during maintenance treatment in UC-2 was 75/172 (44%) among subjects on ustekinumab and 40/172 (23%) in subjects on placebo at Week 44. The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-2, at Week 44 to progression of disease or long-term outcomes was not evaluated in UC-2. Endoscopic Normalization Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. At Week 8 in UC-1, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 25/322 (8%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and 12/319 (4%) of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 44 of UC-2, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 51/176 (29%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and in 32/175 (18%) of subjects in placebo group."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE USTEKINUMAB-TTWE (us-te-KIN-ne-mab ttwe) injection, for subcutaneous use This Instructions for Use contains information on how to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE using a prefilled syringe. Read this Instructions for Use before you start using USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. A healthcare provider should show you how to prepare and give an injection of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE the right way. If you cannot give the injection: ask a healthcare provider to help you, or ask someone who has been trained by a healthcare provider to give the injections. Do not try to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE until you have been shown how to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE by a healthcare provider. Important information You Need to Know Before Injecting USTEKINUMAB-TTWE: For subcutaneous use only (inject directly under the skin) Before you start, check the carton to make sure that it is the right dose. You will have either 45 mg or 90 mg as prescribed by the healthcare provider. If the dose is 45 mg, you will receive one 45 mg prefilled syringe. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give two injections, one right after the other. Check the expiration date on the prefilled syringe and carton. Do not use USTEKINUMAB-TTWE after the expiration date has passed, or if the prefilled syringe has been stored above 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), stored at room temperature up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for longer than 35 days, or returned to the refrigerator and stored for longer than 60 days. Call the healthcare provider or pharmacist, or call Quallent Pharmaceuticals Health LLC at 1-877-605-7243 for help. Make sure the syringe is not damaged. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is damaged . Check the prefilled syringe for any particles or discoloration. The liquid in the prefilled syringe should look clear and colorless to light yellow. Do not use if it is frozen, discolored, cloudy or has particles. Get a new prefilled syringe. Do not shake the prefilled syringe at any time. Shaking the prefilled syringe may damage the USTEKINUMAB-TTWE medicine. If the prefilled syringe has been shaken, do not use it. Get a new prefilled syringe. To reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks, each prefilled syringe has a needle guard that is automatically activated to cover the needle after you have given the injection. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Storing USTEKINUMAB-TTWE prefilled syringes Store USTEKINUMAB-TTWE prefilled syringes in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Store USTEKINUMAB-TTWE prefilled syringes in the original carton to protect from light until the time of use. Do not freeze USTEKINUMAB-TTWE prefilled syringes. If needed, individual prefilled syringes may be stored at room temperature up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for a maximum single period of up to 35 days in the original carton to protect from light. Record the date when the prefilled syringe is removed from the refrigerator on the carton in the space provided. You may return the prefilled syringe to the refrigerator 1 time only for a maximum of 60 days, either during the 35-day period or at the end of the 35-day period. Record the date when the prefilled syringe is returned to the refrigerator on the carton. Throw away (discard) the prefilled syringe if not used within 35 days of room temperature storage and you did not return it to the refrigerator, or if it has been returned to the refrigerator and is not used within 60 days. Keep USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and all medicines out of the reach of children. Gather the supplies you will need to prepare and to give the injection. (See Figure A ) You will need: antiseptic wipes cotton balls or gauze pads adhesive bandage your prescribed dose of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE (See Figure B ) FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" Step 4: Disposing of the syringes. \" Figure A Figure B Step 1: Preparing the injection Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. Leave USTEKINUMAB-TTWE prefilled syringe at room temperature for about 30 minutes before injecting. Do not warm the prefilled syringe in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Hold the prefilled syringe with the covered needle pointing upward. Step 2: Prepare the injection site Choose an injection site around the stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. (See Figure C ) Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard. Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give the injection. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let the skin dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Figure C *Areas in gray are recommended injection sites. Step 3: Injecting USTEKINUMAB-TTWE Remove the needle cover when you are ready to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. Do not touch the plunger or plunger head while removing the needle cover. Hold the body of the prefilled syringe with one hand, and pull the needle cover straight off. (See Figure D ) Put the needle cover in the trash. You may also see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. Do not touch the needle or let it touch anything. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the needle cover in place. Figure D Hold the body of the prefilled syringe in one hand between the thumb and index fingers. (See Figure E ) Figure E Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure F ) Figure F Inject all of the liquid by using your thumb to push in the plunger until the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. (See Figure G ) Figure G When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, keep pressure on the plunger head. Take the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. Slowly take your thumb off the plunger head. This will let the empty syringe move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard. (See Figure H ) Figure H When the needle is pulled out of the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the second injection using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 4: Disposing of the syringes. Put the syringe in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) syringes in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE USTEKINUMAB-TTWE (us-te-KIN-ne-mab ttwe) injection, for subcutaneous use This Instructions for Use contains information on how to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE using a vial. Read this Instructions for Use before you start using USTEKINUMAB-TTWE. A healthcare provider should show you how to prepare, measure the dose, and give an injection of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE the right way. If you cannot give the injection: ask a healthcare provider to help you, or ask someone who has been trained by a healthcare provider to give the injections. Do not try to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE until you have been shown how to inject USTEKINUMAB-TTWE by a healthcare provider. Important information You Need to Know Before Injecting USTEKINUMAB-TTWE: For subcutaneous use only (inject directly under the skin) Before you start, check the carton to make sure that it is the right dose. You will have either 45 mg or 90 mg as prescribed by the healthcare provider. If the dose is 45 mg or less you will receive one 45 mg vial. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive two 45 mg vials and you will need to give two injections, one right after the other . Check the expiration date on the vial and carton. If the expiration date has passed, do not use it. If the expiration date has passed, call the healthcare provider or pharmacist, or call Quallent Pharmaceuticals Health LLC at 1-877-605-7243 for help. Check the vial for any particles or discoloration. The liquid in the vial should look clear and colorless to light yellow. Do not use if it is frozen, discolored, cloudy or has particles. Get a new vial. Do not shake the vial at any time. Shaking the vial may damage the USTEKINUMAB-TTWE medicine. If the vial has been shaken, do not use it. Get a new vial. Do not use a USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vial more than one time, even if there is medicine left in the vial. After the rubber stopper is punctured, USTEKINUMAB-TTWE can become contaminated by harmful bacteria which could cause an infection if re-used. Therefore, throw away any unused USTEKINUMAB-TTWE after you give the injection. Safely throw away (dispose of) USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials, needles, and syringes after use. See \" Step 6: Disposing of needles, syringes, and vials. \" Do not re-use syringes or needles. To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap needles. Storing USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials Store USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Store USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials standing up straight (upright). Store USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials in the original carton to protect from light until the time of use. Do not freeze USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vials. Keep USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and all medicines out of the reach of children. Gather the supplies you will need to prepare USTEKINUMAB-TTWE and to give the injection. (See Figure A ) You will need: a syringe with the needle attached, you will need a prescription from a healthcare provider to get syringes with the needles attached from a pharmacy. antiseptic wipes cotton balls or gauze pads adhesive bandage your prescribed dose of USTEKINUMAB-TTWE FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" Step 6: Disposing of needles, syringes, and vials. \" Figure A Step 1: Preparing the injection. Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Step 2: Preparing your injection site Choose an injection site around the stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, and upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. ( See Figure B ) Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard. Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give the injection. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let the skin dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Figure B *Areas in gray are recommended injection sites. Step 3: Preparing the vial. Remove the cap from the top of the vial. Throw away the cap but do not remove the rubber stopper. (See Figure C ) Figure C Clean the rubber stopper with an antiseptic wipe. (See Figure D ) Figure D Do not touch the rubber stopper after you clean it. Put the vial on a flat surface. Step 4: Preparing the syringe Pick up the syringe with the needle attached. Remove the cap that covers the needle. (See Figure E ) Throw the needle cap away. Do not touch the needle or allow the needle to touch anything. Figure E Carefully pull back on the plunger to the line that matches the dose prescribed by the healthcare provider. Hold the vial between your thumb and index (pointer) finger. Use your other hand to push the syringe needle through the center of the rubber stopper. (See Figure F ) Figure F Push down on the plunger until all of the air has gone from the syringe into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down. (See Figure G ) Hold the USTEKINUMAB-TTWE vial with one hand. It is important that the needle is always in the liquid in order to prevent air bubbles forming in the syringe. Pull back on the syringe plunger with your other hand. Fill the syringe until the black tip of the plunger lines up with the mark that matches the prescribed dose. Figure G Do not remove the needle from the vial. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up to see if it has any air bubbles inside. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the side of the syringe until the air bubbles rise to the top. (See Figure H ) Slowly press the plunger up until all of the air bubbles are out of the syringe (but none of the liquid is out). Remove the syringe from the vial. Do not lay the syringe down or allow the needle to touch anything. Figure H Step 5: Injecting USTEKINUMAB-TTWE Hold the barrel of the syringe in one hand, between the thumb and index fingers. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. (See Figure I ) Figure I Push the plunger with your thumb as far as it will go to inject all of the liquid. Push it slowly and evenly, keeping the skin gently pinched. When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin and then let go of the skin. (See Figure J ) Figure J When the needle is pulled out of the skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If the dose is 90 mg, you will receive two 45 mg vials and you will need to give a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1 to 5 using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 6: Disposing of needles, syringes, and vials. Do not re-use a syringe or needle. To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap a needle. Put the needles and syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of heavy-duty plastic can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out upright and stable during use leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. Throw away the vial into the container where you put the syringes and needles. If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

Ustekinumab-aauz should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that Ustekinumab-aauz be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject Ustekinumab-aauz after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Medication Guide [see Medication Guide] . \u2022 The needle cover on the prefilled syringe is not made with natural rubber (a derivative of latex). \u2022 It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the single-dose vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 29 gauge, \u00bd inch needle is recommended. \u2022 Prior to administration, visually inspect Ustekinumab-aauz for particulate matter and discoloration. Ustekinumab-aauz is a clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly brown-yellow solution. Do not use Ustekinumab-aauz if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. Ustekinumab-aauz does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Instructions for Administration of Ustekinumab-aauz Prefilled Syringes Equipped with Needle Safety Guard Refer to the diagram below for the provided instructions. To prevent premature activation of the needle safety guard, do not touch the NEEDLE GUARD ACTIVATION CLIPS at any time during use. \u2022 Hold the BODY and remove the NEEDLE COVER. Do not hold the PLUNGER or PLUNGER HEAD while removing the NEEDLE COVER or the PLUNGER may move. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the NEEDLE COVER in place. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped or if it is dropped onto a hard surface. \u2022 Inject Ustekinumab-aauz subcutaneously as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 )] . \u2022 Inject all of the medication by pushing in the PLUNGER until the PLUNGER HEAD is completely between the needle guard wings. Injection of the entire prefilled syringe contents is necessary to activate the needle guard . \u2022 After injection, maintain the pressure on the PLUNGER HEAD and remove the needle from the skin. Slowly take your thumb off the PLUNGER HEAD to allow the empty syringe to move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard, as shown by the illustration below: \u2022 Used syringes should be placed in a puncture-resistant container. ustek-img-01.jpg ustek-img-02.jpg ustek-img-03.jpg 2.6 Preparation and Administration of Ustekinumab-aauz 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) Ustekinumab-aauz solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. 1. Calculate the dose and the number of Ustekinumab-aauz vials needed based on patient weight ( Table 4 ). Each 26 mL vial of Ustekinumab-aauz contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-aauz. 2. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of Ustekinumab-aauz to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of Ustekinumab-aauz needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used. 3. Withdraw 26 mL of Ustekinumab-aauz from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. 4. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. 5. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within eight hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. 6. Use only polypropylene (PP) or polyvinylchloride (PVC) infusion sets with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). 7. Do not infuse Ustekinumab-aauz concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. 8. Ustekinumab-aauz does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for up to 7 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 8 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution. Protect from light."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Infections : Serious infections have occurred. Avoid starting Ustekinumab-aauz during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection or clinically significant infection develops, discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz until the infection resolves. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections : Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL- 12/IL-23. Consider diagnostic tests for these infections as dictated by clinical circumstances. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Tuberculosis (TB) : Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aauz. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering Ustekinumab-aauz. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Malignancies : Ustekinumab products may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of ustekinumab products in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions : If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) : If PRES is suspected, treat promptly and discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Immunizations: Avoid use of live vaccines in patients during treatment with Ustekinumab-aauz. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Noninfectious Pneumonia : Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infections Ustekinumab products may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . Serious infections requiring hospitalization, or otherwise clinically significant infections, reported in clinical trials included the following: \u2022 Plaque Psoriasis : diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections. \u2022 Psoriatic arthritis : cholecystitis. \u2022 Crohn's disease : anal abscess, gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeria meningitis. \u2022 Ulcerative colitis : gastroenteritis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, pneumonia, and listeriosis. Avoid initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aauz in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of Ustekinumab-aauz in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with Ustekinumab-aauz and discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. 5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with ustekinumab products may be susceptible to these types of infections. Consider appropriate diagnostic testing (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances). 5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with Ustekinumab-aauz. Avoid administering Ustekinumab-aauz to patients with active tuberculosis infection. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering Ustekinumab-aauz. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Ustekinumab-aauz in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving Ustekinumab-aauz for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment. 5.4 Malignancies Ustekinumab products are immunosuppressants and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received ustekinumab in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 )] . The safety of ustekinumab products has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving ustekinumab products who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer. Monitor all patients receiving Ustekinumab-aauz for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Closely follow patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with ustekinumab products [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz. 5.6 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab product initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab products. Monitor all patients treated with Ustekinumab-aauz for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz. 5.7 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with Ustekinumab-aauz, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with Ustekinumab-aauz should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with Ustekinumab-aauz or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving Ustekinumab-aauz because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of Ustekinumab-aauz may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. 5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue Ustekinumab-aauz and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience ( 6.3 )] ."

Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22651% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the ustekinumab groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during adult plaque psoriasis clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for placebo-treated subjects and 13.4 weeks for ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of placebo-treated subjects (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of placebo-treated subjects (0.02 per patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . In the controlled and non-controlled portions of plaque psoriasis clinical trials (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of plaque psoriasis clinical trials (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in adult psoriasis clinical trials. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn's Disease The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the adult psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical trials. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7 , respectively. Table 6: Common adverse reactions through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in \u22653% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and higher than placebo Placebo N=466 ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common adverse reactions through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in \u22653% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and higher than placebo Placebo N=133 ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=131 Nasopharyngitis Injection site erythema Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection Bronchitis Pruritus Urinary tract infection Sinusitis 8% 0 1% 3% 2% 2% 2% 11% 5% 5% 5% 4% 4% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one patient each [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn's disease clinical trials, 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following ustekinumab administration. One patient experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour. Ulcerative Colitis The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: \u2022 Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). \u2022 Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs. 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of placebo-treated subjects (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.40 events per hundred patient- years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical trials developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In plaque psoriasis clinical trials, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In plaque psoriasis trials, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ustekinumab product exposure. Immune system disorders: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), other hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and urticaria). Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Skin reactions : Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Therapies In plaque psoriasis trials the safety of ustekinumab products in combination with immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In psoriatic arthritis trials, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis induction trials, immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, MTX) were used concomitantly in approximately 30% of subjects and corticosteroids were used concomitantly in approximately 40% and 50% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis subjects, respectively. Use of these concomitant therapies did not appear to influence the overall safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. 7.2 CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, use of ustekinumab products, antagonists of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Ustekinumab-aauz in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and adjust the individual dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates. A CYP-mediated drug interaction effect was not observed in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from observational studies, published case reports, and postmarketing surveillance on the use of ustekinumab products during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, and other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Transport of human IgG antibody across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses and peaks during the third trimester; therefore, ustekinumab products may be transferred to the developing fetus (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring after administration of ustekinumab to pregnant monkeys at exposures greater than 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Because ustekinumab products may theoretically interfere with immune response to infections, consider risks and benefits prior to administering live vaccines to infants exposed to Ustekinumab-aauz in utero. There are insufficient data regarding exposed infant serum levels of ustekinumab products at birth and the duration of persistence of ustekinumab products in infant serum after birth. Although a specific timeframe to delay administration of live attenuated vaccines in infants exposed in utero is unknown, consider the risks and benefits of delaying a minimum of 6 months after birth because of the clearance of the product. Data Animal Data Ustekinumab was tested in two embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No teratogenic or other adverse developmental effects were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered ustekinumab subcutaneously twice weekly or intravenously weekly during the period of organogenesis. Serum concentrations of ustekinumab in pregnant monkeys were greater than 100 times the serum concentration in patients treated subcutaneously with 90 mg of ustekinumab weekly for 4 weeks. In a combined embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab twice weekly at exposures greater than 100 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to Day 33 after delivery. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one monkey administered ustekinumab at 22.5 mg/kg and one monkey dosed at 45 mg/kg. No ustekinumab-related effects on functional, morphological, or immunological development were observed in the neonates from birth through six months of age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from published literature suggests that ustekinumab is present in human breast milk. There are no available data on the effects of ustekinumab products on milk production. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to ustekinumab products are unknown. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant causally related to ustekinumab products have been identified in the published literature or postmarketing experience. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ustekinumab-aauz and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ustekinumab-aauz or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Plaque Psoriasis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aauz have been established for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Use of Ustekinumab-aauz in pediatric patients 12 to less than 17 years of age is supported by evidence from a multicenter, randomized, 60-week trial (Ps STUDY 3) of ustekinumab that included a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group portion, in 110 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Use of Ustekinumab-aauz in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from an open-label, single-arm, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics trial (Ps STUDY 4) of ustekinumab in 44 subjects [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aauz have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aauz have been established for treatment of psoriatic arthritis in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years old. Use of Ustekinumab-aauz in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of ustekinumab in adults with psoriasis and PsA, pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and safety data of ustekinumab from two clinical trials in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old with psoriasis and 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old with psoriasis. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adult subjects with psoriasis, adult subjects with PsA and pediatric subjects with psoriasis, and the PK exposure is expected to be comparable between adult and pediatric subjects with PsA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3 )]. The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aauz have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years old with psoriatic arthritis. Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis The safety and effectiveness of Ustekinumab-aauz have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 6709 subjects exposed to ustekinumab, a total of 340 were 65 years of age or older (183 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 65 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 58 subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease and 34 subjects with ulcerative colitis), and 40 subjects were 75 years of age or older. Clinical trials of ustekinumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u049b monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell-surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products was shown to be protective. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Plaque Psoriasis In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady- state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady- state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady- state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all plaque psoriasis trials following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 to 17 years of age with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Overall, the observed steady state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Ustekinumab products are human IgG1\u049b monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell-surface receptor chain, IL-12R\u03b21. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products was shown to be protective."

Ulcerative Colitis In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T max value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady- state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (\u00b1SD) steady- state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 \u00b1 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 \u00b1 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks. Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean \u00b1SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 \u00b1 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 \u00b1 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 \u00b1 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 \u00b1 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks. Distribution Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the volume of distribution of ustekinumab in the central compartment was 2.7 L (95% CI: 2.69, 2.78) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 3.0 L (95% CI: 2.96, 3.07) in subjects with ulcerative colitis. The total volume of distribution at steady- state was 4.6 L in subjects with Crohn's disease and 4.4 L in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Elimination The mean (\u00b1SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 \u00b1 4.6 to 45.6 \u00b1 80.2 days across all plaque psoriasis trials following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations. These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Metabolism The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab products has not been characterized. As a human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab products are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Specific Populations Weight When given the same dose, subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing more than 100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing 100 kg or less. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (greater than 100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (100 kg or less) in the 45 mg group. Age: Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects with plaque psoriasis greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old. Age: Pediatric Population Following multiple recommended doses of ustekinumab in pediatric subjects 6 to 17 years of age with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. At Week 28, the mean \u00b1SD steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.36 \u00b1 0.26 mcg/mL and 0.54 \u00b1 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Overall, the observed steady state ustekinumab trough concentrations in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis were within the range of those observed for adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and adult subjects with PsA after administration of ustekinumab. Drug Interaction Studies The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), or midazolam (CYP3A substrate) were observed when used concomitantly with ustekinumab at the approved recommended dosage in subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to a TNF blocker in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. In subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not indicate changes in ustekinumab clearance with concomitant use of corticosteroids or immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX); and serum ustekinumab concentrations were not impacted by concomitant use of these medications."

Published literature showed that administration of murine IL-12 caused an anti- tumor effect in mice that contained transplanted tumors and IL-12/IL-23p40 knockout mice or mice treated with anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody had decreased host defense to tumors. Mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL-23 or IL-12 alone developed UV- induced skin cancers earlier and more frequently compared to wild-type mice. The relevance of these experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown. No effects on fertility were observed in male cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ustekinumab at subcutaneous doses up to 45 mg/kg twice weekly (45 times the MRHD on a mg/kg basis) prior to and during the mating period. However, fertility and pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated in mated females.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Plaque Psoriasis Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u226512, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trials. Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The trials had the same design through Week 28. In both trials, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of ustekinumab. Subjects randomized to ustekinumab received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive ustekinumab (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16. In both trials, subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18. Baseline PGA score was marked or severe in 44% of subjects in Ps STUDY 1 and 40% of subjects in Ps STUDY 2. Approximately two-thirds of all subjects had received prior phototherapy, 69% had received either prior conventional systemic or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, with 56% receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 43% receiving prior biologic therapy. A total of 28% of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis. In both trials, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a 6-category scale ranging from 0 (cleared) to 5 (severe) that indicates the physician's overall assessment of psoriasis focusing on plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling. Clinical Response The results of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 are presented in Table 8 below. Table 8: Clinical Outcomes at Week 12 in Adults with Plaque Psoriasis in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ps STUDY 1 Ps STUDY 2 ustekinumab ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects randomized 255 255 256 410 409 411 PASI 75 response 8 (3%) 171 (67%) 170 (66%) 15 (4%) 273 (67%) 311 (76%) PGA of Cleared or Minimal 10 (4%) 151 (59%) 156 (61%) 18 (4%) 277 (68%) 300 (73%) Examination of age, gender, and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to ustekinumab among these subgroups. In subjects who weighed 100 kg or less, response rates were comparable with both the 45 mg and 90 mg doses; however, in subjects who weighed greater than 100 kg, higher response rates were seen with 90 mg dosing compared with 45 mg dosing ( Table 9 below).

At Week 52, 89% (144/162) of subjects re- randomized to ustekinumab treatment were PASI 75 responders compared with 63% (100/159) of subjects re-randomized to placebo (treatment withdrawal after Week 28 dose). The median time to loss of PASI 75 response among the subjects randomized to treatment withdrawal was 16 weeks. 14.2 Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis A multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (Ps STUDY 3) enrolled 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with a minimum BSA involvement of 10%, a PASI score greater than or equal to 12, and a PGA score greater than or equal to 3, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37), the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 36), or one-half the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 37) by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by dosing every 12 weeks (q12w). The recommended dose of ustekinumab was 0.75 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 60 kg, 45 mg for subjects weighing 60 kg to 100 kg, and 90 mg for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg. At Week 12, subjects who received placebo were crossed over to receive ustekinumab at the recommended dose or one-half the recommended dose. Of the pediatric subjects, approximately 63% had prior exposure to phototherapy or conventional systemic therapy and approximately 11% had prior exposure to biologics. The endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1), PASI 75, and PASI 90 at Week 12. Subjects were followed for up to 60 weeks following first administration of trial agent. Clinical Response The efficacy results at Week 12 for Ps STUDY 3 are presented in Table 10 .

Subjects in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. Subjects with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules (39%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (28%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (21%), distal interphalangeal involvement (12%) and arthritis mutilans (0.5%). Over 70% and 40% of the subjects, respectively, had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of subjects continued on stable doses of MTX (\u226425 mg/week). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24. In PsA STUDY 1 and PsA STUDY 2, 80% and 86% of the subjects, respectively, had been previously treated with DMARDs. In PsA STUDY 1, previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 agent was not allowed. In PsA STUDY 2, 58% (n=180) of the subjects had been previously treated with TNF blocker, of whom over 70% had discontinued their TNF blocker treatment for lack of efficacy or intolerance at any time. Clinical Response In both trials, a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (see Table 11 ). ACR 70 responses were also higher in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, although the difference was only numerical (p=NS) in STUDY 2. Responses were consistent in subjects treated with ustekinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate. Responses were similar in subjects regardless of prior TNF\u03b1 exposure.

In both trials, the proportion of HAQ- DI responders (\u22650.3 improvement in HAQ-DI score) was greater in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24. 14.4 Crohn's Disease Ustekinumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction trials (CD-1 and CD-2) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (CD-3) representing 52 weeks of therapy. Subjects in CD-1 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers, while subjects in CD-2 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed treatment with a TNF blocker. Trials CD-1 and CD-2 In trials CD-1 and CD-2, 1409 subjects were randomized, of whom 1368 (CD-1, n=741; CD-2, n=627) were included in the final efficacy analysis. Induction of clinical response (defined as a reduction in CDAI score of greater than or equal to 100 points or CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 6 and clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 8 were evaluated. In both trials, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab at either approximately 6 mg/kg, placebo (see Table 4 ), or 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended). In trial CD-1, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with a TNF blocker: 29% subjects had an inadequate initial response (primary non-responders), 69% responded but subsequently lost response (secondary non-responders) and 36% were intolerant to a TNF blocker. Of these subjects, 48% failed or were intolerant to one TNF blocker and 52% had failed 2 or 3 prior TNF blockers. At baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 46% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 31% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 319 in the ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg group and 313 in the placebo group. In trial CD-2, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with corticosteroids (81% of subjects), at least one immunomodulator (6-MP, AZA, MTX; 68% of subjects), or both (49% of subjects). Additionally, 69% never received a TNF blocker and 31% previously received but had not failed a TNF blocker. At baseline, and throughout the trial, approximately 39% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 35% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 286 in the ustekinumab and 290 in the placebo group. In these induction trials, a greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) achieved clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remission at Week 8 compared to placebo (see Table 13 for clinical response and remission rates). Clinical response and remission were significant as early as Week 3 in ustekinumab-treated subjects and continued to improve through Week 8.

At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 34/56 (61%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who previously failed or were intolerant to TNF blocker therapies were in clinical remission and 23/56 (41%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 27/61 (44%) subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 16/61 (26%) of these subjects were in remission at Week 44. At Week 0 of trial CD-3, 46/72 (64%) ustekinumab-treated subjects who had previously failed immunomodulator therapy or corticosteroids (but not TNF blockers) were in clinical remission and 45/72 (63%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44. In the placebo arm, 50/70 (71%) of these subjects were in clinical remission at Week 0 while 31/70 (44%) were in remission at Week 44. In the subset of these subjects who were also na\u00efve to TNF blockers, 34/52 (65%) of ustekinumab-treated subjects were in clinical remission at Week 44 as compared to 25/51 (49%) in the placebo arm. Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after ustekinumab induction were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial CD-3; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab upon entry into trial CD-3. Of these subjects, 102/219 (47%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later and were followed for the duration of the trial. 14.5 Ulcerative Colitis Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [UC-1 and UC-2 (NCT02407236)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate a biologic (i.e., TNF blocker and/or vedolizumab), corticosteroids, and/or 6-MP or AZA therapy. The 8-week intravenous induction trial (UC-1) was followed by the 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (UC-2) for a total of 52 weeks of therapy. Disease assessment was based on the Mayo score, which ranged from 0 to 12 and has four subscores that were each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally reviewed endoscopy, and physician global assessment. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was defined at baseline (Week 0) as Mayo score of 6 to 12, including a Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22652. An endoscopy score of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; and a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding, ulceration. At baseline, subjects had a median Mayo score of 9, with 84% of subjects having moderate disease (Mayo score 6-10) and 15% having severe disease (Mayo score 11-12). Subjects in these trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and oral corticosteroids (prednisone). Trial UC-1 In UC-1, 961 subjects were randomized at Week 0 to a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab of approximately 6 mg/kg, 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo. Subjects enrolled in UC-1 had to have failed therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or at least one biologic. A total of 51% had failed at least one biologic and 17% had failed both a TNF blocker and an integrin receptor blocker. Of the total population, 46% had failed corticosteroids or immunomodulators but were biologic-na\u00efve and an additional 3% had previously received but had not failed a biologic. At induction baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 52% subjects were receiving oral corticosteroids, 28% subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) and 69% subjects were receiving aminosalicylates. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission with a definition of: Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal bleeding), and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and Mayo subscore of 1 defined as presence of erythema, decreased vascular pattern and no friability) is provided in Table 15 . The secondary endpoints were clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic- endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical response with a definition of (\u2265 2 points and \u2265 30% decrease in modified Mayo score, defined as 3-component Mayo score without the Physician's Global Assessment, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), endoscopic improvement with a definition of Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement with a definition of combined endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement of the colon tissue [neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue]) are provided in Table 14 . In UC-1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) were in clinical remission and response and achieved endoscopic improvement and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement compared to placebo (see Table 15 ). Table 15: Proportion of Subjects Meeting Efficacy Endpoints at Week 8 in UC-1 \u2020 Infusion dose of ustekinumab using the weight-based dosage regimen specified in Table 3 . \u2e38 An additional 7 subjects on placebo and 9 subjects on ustekinumab (6 mg/kg) had been exposed to, but had not failed, biologics. * Clinical remission was defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). \u00a7 Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). \u2020 Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score by \u226530% and \u22652 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. \u2021 Histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement was defined as combined endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1) and histologic improvement of the colon tissue (neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue). a Adjusted treatment difference (97.5% CI) b p < 0.001 Endpoint Placebo N = 319 ustekinumab \u2020 N = 322 Treatment difference and 97.5% CI a N % N % Clinical Remission * 22 7% 62 19% 12% (7%, 18%) b Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 14/151 9% 36/147 24% Prior biologic failure 7/161 4% 24/166 14% Endoscopic Improvement \u00a7 40 13% 80 25% 12% (6%, 19%) b Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 28/151 19% 43/147 29% Prior biologic failure 11/161 7% 34/166 20% Clinical Response \u2020 99 31% 186 58% 27% (18%, 35%) b Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 55/151 36% 94/147 64% Prior biologic failure 42/161 26% 86/166 52% Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement \u2021 26 8% 54 17% 9% (3%, 14%) b Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 19/151 13% 30/147 20% Prior biologic failure 6/161 4% 21/166 13% The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-1, at Week 8 to disease progression and long-term outcomes was not evaluated during UC-1. Rectal Bleeding and Stool Frequency Subscores Decreases in rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores were observed as early as Week 2 in ustekinumab-treated subjects. Trial UC-2 The maintenance trial (UC-2) evaluated 523 subjects who achieved clinical response 8 weeks following the intravenous administration of either induction dose of ustekinumab in UC-1. These subjects were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or every 12 weeks (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo for 44 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical response at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 44, the proportion of subjects with corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 44, and the proportion of subjects maintaining clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction. Results of the primary and secondary endpoints at Week 44 in subjects treated with ustekinumab at the recommended dosage (90 mg every 8 weeks) compared to the placebo are shown in Table 16 . Table 16: Efficacy Endpoints of Maintenance at Week 44 in UC-2 (52 Weeks from Initiation of the Induction Dose) \u2e38 An additional 3 subjects on placebo and 6 subjects on ustekinumab had been exposed to, but had not failed, biologics. * The placebo group consisted of subjects who were in response to ustekinumab and were randomized to receive placebo at the start of maintenance therapy. ** Clinical remission was defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). \u2020 Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score by \u226530% and \u22652 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore \u22651 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. \u00a7 Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (modified so that 1 does not include friability). \u2021 Corticosteroid-free clinical remission was defined as subjects in clinical remission and not receiving corticosteroids at Week 44. a p =<0.001 b p=0.004 Endpoint Placebo * N = 175 \u2020 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks N = 176 Treatment difference and 95% CI N % N % Clinical Remission ** 46 26% 79 45% 19% (9%, 28%) a Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 30/84 36% 39/79 49% Prior biologic failure 16/88 18% 37/91 41% Maintenance of Clinical Response at Week 44 \u2020 84 48% 130 74% 26% (16%, 36%) a Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 49/84 58% 62/79 78% Prior biologic failure 35/88 40% 64/91 70% Endoscopic Improvement \u00a7 47 27% 83 47% 20% (11%, 30%) a Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 29/84 35% 42/79 53% Prior biologic failure 18/88 20% 38/91 42% Corticosteroid-free Clinical Remission \u2021 45 26% 76 43% 17% (8%, 27%) a Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 30/84 36% 38/79 48% Prior biologic failure 15/88 17% 35/91 38% Maintenance of Clinical Remission at Week 44 in subjects who achieved clinical remission 8 weeks after induction 18/50 36% 27/41 66% 31% (12%, 50%) b Bio-na\u00efve \u2e38 12/27 44% 14/20 70% Prior biologic failure 6/23 26% 12/18 67% Other Endpoints Week 16 Responders to Ustekinumab Induction Subjects who were not in clinical response 8 weeks after induction with ustekinumab in UC-1 were not included in the primary efficacy analyses for trial UC-2; however, these subjects were eligible to receive a 90 mg subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab at Week 8. Of these subjects, 55/101 (54%) achieved clinical response eight weeks later (Week 16) and received ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks during the UC-2 trial. At Week 44, there were 97/157 (62%) subjects who maintained clinical response and there were 51/157 (32%) who achieved clinical remission. Histologic-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement at Week 44 The proportion of subjects achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement during maintenance treatment in UC-2 was 75/172 (44%) among subjects on ustekinumab and 40/172 (23%) in subjects on placebo at Week 44. The relationship of histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, as defined in UC-2, at Week 44 to progression of disease or long-term outcomes was not evaluated in UC-2. Endoscopic Normalization Normalization of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. At Week 8 in UC-1, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 25/322 (8%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and 12/319 (4%) of subjects in the placebo group. At Week 44 of UC-2, endoscopic normalization was achieved in 51/176 (29%) of subjects treated with ustekinumab and in 32/175 (18%) of subjects in placebo group."

Your doctor or nurse should show you how to prepare and give your injection of Ustekinumab-aauz the right way. If you cannot give yourself the injection: \u2022 ask your doctor or nurse to help you, or \u2022 ask someone who has been trained by a doctor or nurse to give your injections. Do not try to inject Ustekinumab-aauz yourself until you have been shown how to inject Ustekinumab-aauz by your doctor, nurse or health professional. Important information: \u2022 Before you start, check the carton to make sure that it is the right dose. You will have either 45 mg or 90 mg as prescribed by your doctor. o If your dose is 45 mg, you will receive one 45 mg prefilled syringe. o If your dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give yourself two injections, one right after the other. \u2022 Children 12 years of age and older with psoriasis, who weigh 132 pounds (60 kg) or more may use a prefilled syringe. \u2022 Store Ustekinumab-aauz in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) in the original carton to protect from light. \u2022 If needed, individual Ustekinumab-aauz prefilled syringes may also be stored at room temperature up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for a maximum single period of up to 30 days in the original carton to protect from light. Record the date when the prefilled syringe is first removed from the refrigerator on the carton in the space provided. If a syringe has been stored at room temperature, it should not be returned to the refrigerator. \u2022 Check the expiration date on the prefilled syringe and carton. If the expiration date has passed or if the prefilled syringe has been kept at room temperature up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for longer than a maximum single period of 30 days or if the prefilled syringe has been stored above 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), do not use it. If the expiration date has passed or if the prefilled syringe has been stored above 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), call your doctor or pharmacist, or call or call manufacturer`s phone for help. \u2022 Make sure the syringe is not damaged. \u2022 Check your prefilled syringe for any particles or discoloration. Your prefilled syringe should look clear and colorless to slightly brown-yellow. \u2022 Do not use if it is frozen, discolored, cloudy or has particles. Get a new prefilled syringe. \u2022 Do not shake the prefilled syringe at any time . Shaking your prefilled syringe may damage your Ustekinumab-aauz medicine. If your prefilled syringe has been shaken, do not use it. Get a new prefilled syringe. \u2022 To reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks, each prefilled syringe has a needle guard that is automatically activated to cover the needle after you have given your injection. Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. Gather the supplies you will need to prepare and to give your injection. (See Figure A) You will need: \u2022 antiseptic wipes \u2022 cotton balls or gauze pads \u2022 adhesive bandage \u2022 your prescribed dose of Ustekinumab-aauz (See Figure B) \u2022 FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" Step 4: Dispose of the syringe.\" Figure A Figure B To prevent early activation of the needle safety guard, do not touch the NEEDLE GUARD ACTIVATION CLIPS at any time during use. Step 1: Prepare the injection. \u2022 Choose a well-lit, clean, flat work surface. \u2022 Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. \u2022 Hold the prefilled syringe with the covered needle pointing upward. Step 2: Prepare your injection site \u2022 Choose an injection site around your stomach area (abdomen), buttocks, upper legs (thighs). If a caregiver is giving you the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. ( See Figure C) \u2022 Use a different injection site for each injection. Do not give an injection in an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red or hard. \u2022 Clean the skin with an antiseptic wipe where you plan to give your injection. \u2022 Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Let your skin dry before injecting. \u2022 Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Figure C *Areas in gray are recommended injection sites. Step 3: Inject Ustekinumab-aauz \u2022 Remove the needle cover when you are ready to inject your Ustekinumab-aauz. \u2022 Do not touch the plunger or plunger head while removing the needle cover. \u2022 Hold the body of the prefilled syringe with one hand and pull the needle cover straight off. ( See Figure D ) \u2022 Put the needle cover in the trash. \u2022 You may also see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. \u2022 Do not touch the needle or let it touch anything. \u2022 Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the needle cover in place or if it is dropped onto a hard surface. Call your doctor, nurse or health professional for instructions. Figure D Figure E \u2022 Do not pull back on the plunger at any time. \u2022 Use the other hand to gently pinch the cleaned area of skin. Hold firmly. \u2022 Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle. ( See Figure F) Figure F \u2022 Inject all of the liquid by using your thumb to push in the plunger until the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. ( See Figure G ) Figure G \u2022 When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, keep pressure on the plunger head. Take the needle out of the skin and let go of the skin. \u2022 Slowly take your thumb off the plunger head. This will let the empty syringe move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard. ( See Figure H) Figure H \u2022 When the needle is pulled out of your skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. This is normal. You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad to the injection site if needed. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. If your dose is 90 mg, you will receive either one 90 mg prefilled syringe or two 45 mg prefilled syringes. If you receive two 45 mg prefilled syringes for a 90 mg dose, you will need to give yourself a second injection right after the first. Repeat Steps 1\u20133 for the second injection using a new syringe. Choose a different site for the second injection. Step 4: Dispose of the syringe. \u2022 Put the syringe in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose syringes in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of heavy-duty plastic. o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out. o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, o and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be local or state laws about how to throw away syringes and needles. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your sharps disposal container. \u2022 If you have any questions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Keep Ustekinumab-aauz and all medicines out of the reach of children.
