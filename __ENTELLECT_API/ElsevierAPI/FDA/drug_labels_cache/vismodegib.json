      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while receiving ERIVEDGE and for 24 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE ( 5.1 ) Advise males not to donate semen during and for 3 months after therapy ( 5.1 , 8.3 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Permanently discontinue ERIVEDGE in patients with these reactions ( 5.2 ) Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions: Temporary dose interruption or discontinuation may be required for these reactions ( 5.3 ) Premature fusion of the epiphyses ( 5.4 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ERIVEDGE can cause embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, vismodegib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at maternal exposures lower than the human exposures at the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females of Reproductive Potential Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating ERIVEDGE. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with ERIVEDGE and for 24 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. Males Vismodegib is present in semen. It is not known if the amount of vismodegib in semen can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise males to use condoms, even after a vasectomy, to avoid potential drug exposure in pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential during therapy and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE. Advise male patients not to donate semen during and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Blood Donation Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while receiving ERIVEDGE and for 24 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with ERIVEDGE [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Permanently discontinue ERIVEDGE in patients with these reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.3 Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions Musculoskeletal adverse reactions, which may be accompanied by serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations, have occurred with ERIVEDGE and other drugs which inhibit the hedgehog (Hh) pathway. In the pooled safety population in clinical trials of ERIVEDGE, musculoskeletal and connective tissue adverse reactions occurred in 78% of patients treated, with 7% (9/138) reported as Grade 3. The most frequent manifestations of musculoskeletal and connective tissue adverse reactions (all grades) reported were muscle spasms (72%) and arthralgias (16%). In a post-approval clinical trial of 1232 patients, Grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum CPK laboratory values occurred in 2.4% of the 453 patients who had any CPK measurement [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Obtain baseline serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine levels and as clinically indicated (e.g., if muscle symptoms are reported). Depending on the severity of symptoms, temporary dose interruption or discontinuation may be required for musculoskeletal adverse reactions or serum CPK elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.4 Premature Fusion of the Epiphyses Premature fusion of the epiphyses has been reported in pediatric patients exposed to ERIVEDGE. In some cases, fusion progressed after drug discontinuation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. ERIVEDGE is not indicated for pediatric patients."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Premature Fusion of the Epiphyses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 10%) are muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgias, vomiting, and ageusia. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech, Inc. at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to ERIVEDGE in 138 patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who received ERIVEDGE at doses \u2265 150 mg orally daily in four open-label, uncontrolled, dose-ranging or fixed single dose clinical trials [Study SHH3925g, SHH4437g, SHH4476g and SHH4610g]. The median age of these patients was 61 years (range 21 to 101 years), 100% were White (including Hispanics), and 64% were male. The median duration of treatment was approximately 10 months (range 21 days to 36 months); 111 patients received ERIVEDGE for 6 months or longer. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) were muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgias, vomiting, and ageusia ( Table 1 ). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 10% of Patients with Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma Adverse Reaction ERIVEDGE (N = 138) All Grades Grading according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.

Laboratory Abnormalities Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials were hyponatremia (4%), azotemia (2%) and hypokalemia (1%). Additionally, in a post-approval clinical trial conducted in 1232 patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC treated with ERIVEDGE, a subset of 29 patients had baseline values for blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) reported. Within this subset of patients, 38% had a shift from baseline, including Grade 3 (3%) increased CPK. Grade 3 or 4 increased CPK occurred in 2.4% of the 453 patients across the entire study population with any CPK measurement. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ERIVEDGE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary disorders: Drug-induced liver injury Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ERIVEDGE during pregnancy. Report pregnancies to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal reproduction studies, ERIVEDGE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of vismodegib during organogenesis at doses below the 150 mg clinical dose resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats (see Data ) . There are no human data on the use of ERIVEDGE in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal toxicity study, pregnant rats were administered vismodegib orally at doses of 10, 60, or 300 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Pre- and post-implantation loss were increased at doses of \u2265 60 mg/kg/day [approximately 2 times the human exposure at the 150 mg clinical dose based on area under the curve (AUC)], which included early resorption of 100% of the fetuses. A dose of 10 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.2 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended 150 mg clinical dose] resulted in malformations (including missing and/or fused digits, open perineum and craniofacial anomalies) and retardations or variations (including dilated renal pelvis, dilated ureter, and incompletely or unossified sternal elements, centra of vertebrae, or proximal phalanges and claws). 8.2 Lactation No data are available regarding the presence of vismodegib in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ERIVEDGE, advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during therapy with ERIVEDGE and for 24 months after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating ERIVEDGE. Contraception Based on its mechanism of action and animal data, ERIVEDGE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with ERIVEDGE and for 24 months after the final dose. Males Vismodegib is present in semen [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not known if the amount of vismodegib in semen can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise male patients to use condoms, even after a vasectomy, to avoid drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential during therapy with and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE. Advise males of the potential risk to an embryo or fetus if a female partner of reproductive potential is exposed to ERIVEDGE. Advise males not to donate semen during therapy with ERIVEDGE and for 3 months after the final dose. Infertility Females Amenorrhea can occur in females of reproductive potential. Reversibility of amenorrhea is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ERIVEDGE have not been established in pediatric patients. Premature fusion of the epiphyses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] and precocious puberty have been reported in pediatric patients exposed to ERIVEDGE. In some cases, epiphyseal fusion progressed after drug discontinuation . Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats, administration of oral vismodegib resulted in toxicities in bone and teeth. Effects on bone consisted of closure of the epiphyseal growth plate when oral vismodegib was administered for 26 weeks at \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (approximately \u2265 0.4 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 150 mg clinical dose). Abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (including degeneration/necrosis of odontoblasts, formation of fluid-filled cysts in the dental pulp, ossification of the root canal, and hemorrhage resulting in breakage or loss of teeth) were observed after administration of oral vismodegib at \u2265 15 mg/kg/day (approximately \u2265 0.2 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 150 mg clinical dose). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ERIVEDGE did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vismodegib is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway. Vismodegib binds to and inhibits Smoothened, a transmembrane protein involved in Hedgehog signal transduction. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology ERIVEDGE did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent following 7 days of 150 mg once-daily dosing (at steady state) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of vismodegib were studied in healthy subjects and patients. Following daily oral dosing, the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib appear to be nonlinear with steady state achieved within 7 days. Increasing the dose from 150 mg to 540 mg (1 to 3.6 times the recommended dose) does not result in higher steady state plasma concentrations. Average plasma concentration of vismodegib at steady state (C ss,avg ) is ~23 \u00b5M following 150 mg once daily dose. Absorption The single dose absolute bioavailability of vismodegib is 32%. Absorption is saturable as evidenced by the lack of dose proportional increase in exposure after a single dose of 270 mg or 540 mg vismodegib. Effect of Food C max and AUC 0-24hr of vismodegib at steady state are not affected by food. Distribution The volume of distribution of vismodegib ranges from 16.4 to 26.6 L. Vismodegib plasma protein binding in patients is > 99%. Vismodegib binds to both human serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and binding to AAG is saturable. Male patients had an average concentration of vismodegib in semen on day 8 that was 6.5% of the average steady state concentration (C ss ) observed in plasma. Elimination The estimated elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of vismodegib is 4 days after continuous once-daily dosing and 12 days after a single dose. Metabolism Greater than 98% of the total circulating drug-related components are the parent drug. Metabolic pathways of vismodegib in humans include oxidation, glucuronidation, and pyridine ring cleavage. The two most abundant oxidative metabolites recovered in feces are produced in vitro by recombinant CYP2C9 and CYP3A. Excretion Vismodegib and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the hepatic route with 82% of the administered dose recovered in the feces and 4.4% recovered in urine. Specific Populations Weight (41-140 kg), age (26-89 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 79 mL/min), mild hepatic impairment (normal total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 times ULN), moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN), or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 to 10 times ULN) had no clinically relevant effects on the systemic exposure of vismodegib. The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in vismodegib pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with fluconazole (moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor), itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) and rabeprazole (gastric acid reducing agent, proton pump inhibitor). No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were observed when used concomitantly with vismodegib: rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) or ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (oral contraceptive). In Vitro Studies Vismodegib is an inhibitor of the transporter BCRP and is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A."

Effect of Food C max and AUC 0-24hr of vismodegib at steady state are not affected by food. Distribution The volume of distribution of vismodegib ranges from 16.4 to 26.6 L. Vismodegib plasma protein binding in patients is > 99%. Vismodegib binds to both human serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and binding to AAG is saturable. Male patients had an average concentration of vismodegib in semen on day 8 that was 6.5% of the average steady state concentration (C ss ) observed in plasma. Elimination The estimated elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of vismodegib is 4 days after continuous once-daily dosing and 12 days after a single dose. Metabolism Greater than 98% of the total circulating drug-related components are the parent drug. Metabolic pathways of vismodegib in humans include oxidation, glucuronidation, and pyridine ring cleavage. The two most abundant oxidative metabolites recovered in feces are produced in vitro by recombinant CYP2C9 and CYP3A. Excretion Vismodegib and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the hepatic route with 82% of the administered dose recovered in the feces and 4.4% recovered in urine. Specific Populations Weight (41-140 kg), age (26-89 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 79 mL/min), mild hepatic impairment (normal total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 times ULN), moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN), or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 to 10 times ULN) had no clinically relevant effects on the systemic exposure of vismodegib. The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in vismodegib pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with fluconazole (moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor), itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) and rabeprazole (gastric acid reducing agent, proton pump inhibitor). No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were observed when used concomitantly with vismodegib: rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) or ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (oral contraceptive). In Vitro Studies Vismodegib is an inhibitor of the transporter BCRP and is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats. No carcinogenic potential was identified in either species. Vismodegib was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro human chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. In a dedicated 26-week rat fertility study, no effects on male reproductive organs or fertility endpoints were observed at vismodegib doses of 100 mg/kg/day [approximately 1.3 times the human exposure (steady state AUC 0-24hr ) at the 150 mg clinical dose] either at the end of dosing or following a 16-week recovery phase. While there were increased numbers of degenerating germ cells and hypospermia in sexually immature dogs observed at \u2265 50 mg/kg/day in the 4-week general toxicity study, there were no effects on male reproductive organs in sexually mature rats and dogs, in the vismodegib general toxicity studies of up to 26-weeks. In a female fertility study, treatment of rats with vismodegib at 100 mg/kg/day [approximately 1.2-times the human exposure (steady state AUC 0-24hr ) at the 150 mg clinical dose] for 26-weeks prior to mating resulted in decreased implantations, increased percent preimplantation loss, and decreased numbers of dams with viable embryos. No vismodegib-related changes in fertility were observed following a 16-week recovery period. In a 26-week general toxicity study in rats, decreased numbers of corpora lutea were observed at 100 mg/kg/day; the effect was not reversed by the end of an 8-week recovery period. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Neurologic effects characterized as limb or body tremors or twitching were observed in rats administered oral vismodegib for 4 weeks or longer at \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (approximately \u2265 0.4 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 150 mg clinical dose). These observations resolved upon discontinuation of dosing and were not associated with microscopic findings."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A single, international, single-arm, multi-center, open-label, 2-cohort trial [SHH4476g (NCT00833417)] was conducted in 104 patients with either metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC) (n = 33) or locally advanced BCC (laBCC) (n = 71). Patients with laBCC were required to have lesions that had recurred after radiotherapy, unless radiotherapy was contraindicated or inappropriate (e.g. Gorlin syndrome; limitations because of location of tumor or cumulative prior radiotherapy dose), and where the lesions were either unresectable or surgical resection would result in substantial deformity. Patients were to receive ERIVEDGE 150 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF). In the mBCC cohort, tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. In the laBCC cohort, tumor response evaluation included measurement of externally assessable tumor (including scar) and assessment for ulceration in photographs, radiographic assessment of target lesions (if appropriate), and tumor biopsy. An objective response in laBCC required at least one of the following criteria and absence of any criterion for disease progression: (1) \u2265 30% reduction in lesion size [sum of the longest diameter (SLD)] from baseline in target lesions by radiographic assessment; (2) \u2265 30% reduction in SLD from baseline in externally visible dimension of target lesions; (3) complete resolution of ulceration in all target lesions. Complete response was defined as objective response (as defined above) with no residual BCC on sampling tumor biopsy. Disease progression was defined as any of the following: (1) \u2265 20% increase in the SLD from nadir in target lesions (either by radiography or by externally visible dimension); (2) new ulceration of target lesions persisting without evidence of healing for at least 2 weeks; (3) new lesions by radiographic assessment or physical examination; (4) progression of non-target lesions by RECIST. Of the 104 patients enrolled, 96 patients were evaluable for ORR. Twenty-one percent of patients carried a diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome. The median age of the efficacy evaluable population was 62 years (46% were at least 65 years old), 61% male and 100% White. For the mBCC cohort (n = 33), 97% of patients had prior therapy including surgery (97%), radiotherapy (58%), and systemic therapies (30%). For the laBCC cohort (n = 63), 94% of patients had prior therapies including surgery (89%), radiotherapy (27%), and systemic/topical therapies (11%). The median duration of treatment was 10.2 months (range 0.7 to 18.7 months). The efficacy results are presented in Table 2 .
