      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u00b7 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1). \u00b7 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil tablets reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2) 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226440%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets also have an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 to 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to \u02c26 years) (2.2) 0.2 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to \u02c217 years) (2.2) <50 kg 4 to 8 mg tablet once daily >50 kg 8 to 16 mg tablet once daily <50 kg 4 to 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose >50 kg 4 to 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil tablet is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to <17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil tablets under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Children 1 to <6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.2 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to <17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to <6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to <17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets since candesartan cilexetil tablets has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u00b7 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use, Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u00b7 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u00b7 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u00b7 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u00b7 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u00b7 Mix thoroughly. \u00b7 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u00b7 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00b7 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: o Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) (6.1). o Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) (5.5). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo- controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to <6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to <17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co\u00adadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min) [see Contraindications (4)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u00b7 Nursing Mothers : Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2). \u00b7 Pediatrics : Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2). Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to <17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE No lethality was observed in acute toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil. In mice given single oral doses of the primary metabolite, candesartan, the minimum lethal dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg. The most likely manifestation of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Treatment: To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and altered pharmacokinetics in your patient."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1) - 1 - Hydroxyethyl 2 - ethoxy - 1 - [ p - ( o - 1 H - tetrazol - 5\u00ad ylphenyl) benzyl] - 7 -benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is Candesartan cilexetil, USP is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablet containing 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil, USP and the following inactive ingredients: mannitol, pullulan, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, corn starch, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate and lactose monohydrate. The 32 mg tablet contains iron oxide red as a colorant. Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once- daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u22658 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics has not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8 to 12/4 to 8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low\u00ad renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <6 years old and 6 to <17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to <6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6/5.2 to 12/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to <17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed <50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those >50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to <17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 to 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4 to 8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine \u22653 mg/dL, serum potassium \u22655.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM-Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2013 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67 to 0.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71 to 1.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57 to 0.81) <0.001 In CHARM-Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1) . Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Candesartan cilexetil also has an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 - 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to < 6 years) (2.2) 0.20 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 - 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to < 17 years) (2.2) < 50 kg 4 \u2013 8 mg tablet once daily > 50 kg 8 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily < 50 kg 4 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose > 50 kg 4 \u2013 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 32 mg tablet once daily 1 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Children 1 to < 6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to < 17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil since candesartan cilexetil has not been studied in this population [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. Mix thoroughly. Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (5.3) . Monitor renal function (5.4) and potassium levels (5.5) . 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) ( 6.1 ). Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) ( 5.5 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-204-1431 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to < 6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to < 17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21.0% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Combined inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia ( 7 ). 7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2). Pediatrics: Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2) . Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to < 17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1)-1-Hydroxyethyl 2-ethoxy-1-[ p-(o -1 H -tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]-7-benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is Candesartan cilexetil is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablets containing either 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, lactose, corn starch, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate. Ferric oxide (reddish brown) is added to the 8-mg, 16-mg, and 32-mg tablets as a colorant. structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose.

Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8-12/4-8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.20 or 0.40 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6.0/5.2 to 12.0/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 - 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4-8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL, serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM\u2013Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1).

The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1) . \u2022 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Candesartan cilexetil also has an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 - 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to < 6 years) (2.2) 0.20 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 - 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to < 17 years) (2.2) < 50 kg 4 \u2013 8 mg tablet once daily > 50 kg 8 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily < 50 kg 4 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose > 50 kg 4 \u2013 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 32 mg tablet once daily 1 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Children 1 to < 6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to < 17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil since candesartan cilexetil has not been studied in this population [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u2022 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u2022 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u2022 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u2022 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u2022 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u2022 Mix thoroughly. \u2022 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u2022 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: \u2022 Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) ( 6.1 ). \u2022 Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) ( 5.5 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to < 6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to < 17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21.0% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Nursing Mothers: Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2). \u2022 Pediatrics: Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2) . Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to < 17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1)-1-Hydroxyethyl 2-ethoxy-1-[ p-(o -1 H -tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]-7-benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is Candesartan cilexetil is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablets containing either 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, lactose, corn starch, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate. Ferric oxide (reddish brown) is added to the 8-mg, 16-mg, and 32-mg tablets as a colorant. structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8-12/4-8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.20 or 0.40 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6.0/5.2 to 12.0/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 - 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4-8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL, serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM\u2013Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2014 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67\u20130.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71\u20131.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57\u20130.81) <0.001 In CHARM\u2013Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2.

What are the ingredients in candesartan cilexetil? Active ingredient: candesartan cilexetil. Inactive ingredients in candesartan cilexetil tablets and candesartan cilexetil oral suspension are: hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, lactose, corn starch, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate. Ferric oxide (reddish brown) is added to the 8-mg, 16-mg, and 32-mg tablets as a colorant. In addition to the above, candesartan cilexetil oral suspension also includes the following inactive ingredients: Ora Plus, Ora Sweet or Ora-Blend. How does candesartan cilexetil work? Candesartan cilexetil is a type of medicine called angiotensin receptor blocker, which blocks the effect of the hormone angiotensin II, causing the blood vessels to relax. This helps lower blood pressure. Medicines that lower your blood pressure lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1) . \u2022 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Candesartan cilexetil also has an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 - 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to < 6 years) (2.2) 0.20 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 - 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to < 17 years) (2.2) < 50 kg 4 \u2013 8 mg tablet once daily > 50 kg 8 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily < 50 kg 4 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose > 50 kg 4 \u2013 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 32 mg tablet once daily 1 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Children 1 to < 6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to < 17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil since candesartan cilexetil has not been studied in this population [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u2022 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u2022 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u2022 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u2022 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u2022 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u2022 Mix thoroughly. \u2022 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u2022 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (5.3) . \u2022 Monitor renal function (5.4) and potassium levels (5.5) . 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: \u2022 Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) ( 6.1 ). \u2022 Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) ( 5.5 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to < 6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to < 17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21.0% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Nursing Mothers: Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2). \u2022 Pediatrics: Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2) . Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to < 17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1)-1-Hydroxyethyl 2-ethoxy-1-[ p-(o -1 H -tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]-7-benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is Candesartan cilexetil is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablets containing either 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, lactose, corn starch, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate. Ferric oxide (reddish brown) is added to the 8-mg, 16-mg, and 32-mg tablets as a colorant."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose.

Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8-12/4-8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.20 or 0.40 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6.0/5.2 to 12.0/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 - 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4-8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL, serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM\u2013Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1.

The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1) . \u2022 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Candesartan cilexetil also has an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 - 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to < 6 years) (2.2) 0.20 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 - 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to < 17 years) (2.2) < 50 kg 4 \u2013 8 mg tablet once daily > 50 kg 8 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily < 50 kg 4 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose > 50 kg 4 \u2013 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 32 mg tablet once daily 1 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Children 1 to < 6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to < 17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil since candesartan cilexetil has not been studied in this population [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u2022 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u2022 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u2022 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u2022 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u2022 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u2022 Mix thoroughly. \u2022 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u2022 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (5.3) . \u2022 Monitor renal function (5.4) and potassium levels (5.5) . 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: \u2022 Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) ( 6.1 ). \u2022 Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) ( 5.5 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-204-1431 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to < 6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to < 17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21.0% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Nursing Mothers: Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2). \u2022 Pediatrics: Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2) . Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to < 17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1)-1-Hydroxyethyl 2-ethoxy-1-[ p-(o -1 H -tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]-7-benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is Candesartan cilexetil is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablets containing either 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil and the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, lactose, corn starch, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate. Ferric oxide (reddish brown) is added to the 8-mg, 16-mg, and 32-mg tablets as a colorant. structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10\u2013fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assay. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8-12/4-8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.20 or 0.40 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6.0/5.2 to 12.0/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 - 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4-8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL, serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM\u2013Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2014 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67\u20130.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71\u20131.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57\u20130.81) <0.001 In CHARM\u2013Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Pharmacokinetics General Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Hydrochlorothiazide When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. Metabolism and Excretion Candesartan Cilexetil Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Distribution Candesartan Cilexetil The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Special Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have not been investigated in patients <18 years of age. Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years). The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Gender There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Safety and effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL \u226430 ml/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild CrCL 60-90 ml/min) or moderate (CrCL 30-60 ml/min) renal impairment. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The AUC for candesartan in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was increased 30% and 145% respectively. The C max for candesartan was increased 56% and 73% respectively. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Monitor patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Pharmacodynamics Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once-daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Hydrochlorothiazide After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Clinical Trials CandesartanCilexetil \u2212 Hydrochlorothiazide Of 12 controlled clinical trials involving 4588 patients, 5 were double-blind, placebo controlled and evaluated the antihypertensive effects of single entities vs the combination. These 5 trials, of 8 to 12 weeks duration, randomized 3037 hypertensive patients. Doses ranged from 2 to 32 mg candesartan cilexetil and from 6.25 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide administered once daily in various combinations. The combination of candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 14-18/8-11 mm Hg at doses of 16 mg/12.5 mg and 32 mg/12.5 mg. The combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/25 mg resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 16-19/9-11 mm Hg. The placebo corrected trough to peak ratio was evaluated in a study of candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/12.5 mg and was 88%. Most of the antihypertensive effect of the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide was seen in 1 to 2 weeks with the full effect observed within 4 weeks. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was maintained. The antihypertensive effect was similar regardless of age or gender, and overall response to the combination was similar in black and non-black patients. No appreciable changes in heart rate were observed with combination therapy in controlled trials."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to candesartan, to hydrochlorothiazide or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated in patients with anuria."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use .) There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. For mice, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1000 mg/kg/day (about 150 times the maximum recommended daily human dose [MRHD] Doses compared on the basis of body surface area. MRHD considered to be 32 mg for candesartan cilexetil and 12.5 mg for hydrochlorothiazide. ). For rats, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 100 mg/kg/day (about 31 times the MRHD 1 ). For rabbits, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1 mg/kg/day (a maternally toxic dose that is about half the MRHD 1 ). In each of these studies, hydrochlorothiazide was tested at the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day, about 4, 8, and 15 times the MRHD 1 in mouse, rats, and rabbit, respectively). There was no evidence of harm to the rat or mouse fetus or embryo in studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was administered alone to the pregnant rat or mouse at doses of up to 1000 and 3000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets or volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with heart failure, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may cause excessive hypotension, which may lead to oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death (see WARNINGS , Impaired Renal Function ). In such patients, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of candesartan or diuretic is increased. Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Potassium Abnormalities Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. In clinical trials of various doses of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 2.5% versus 2.1% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% versus 1.0% for placebo. No patient receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg or 32 mg/12.5 mg was discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy . Hypersensitivity Reaction Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevation of serum calcium. Avoid using candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with hypercalcemia. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Information for Patients Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. Tell patients that if syncope occurs, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets until the physician has been consulted. Tell all patients that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets not to use potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels without consulting the prescribing physician. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening. Drug Interactions Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Interactions common to both Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use. Interactions with Candesartan Cilexetil Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics \u2212 Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) \u2212 Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Diazoxide \u2212 the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. Ion Exchange resins \u2212 Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins. Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) \u2212 Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Digitalis \u2212 Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Noradrenaline \u2212 Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone \u2212 Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Cytotoxic products \u2212 Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. Cyclosporine \u2212 Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Candesartan cilexetil or candesartan (the active metabolite), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, tested positive in vitro in the Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay and mouse lymphoma mutagenicity assay. The candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide combination tested negative for mutagenicity in bacteria (Ames test), for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver, for chromosomal aberrations in rat bone marrow and for micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Both candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro CHL chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay, the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assays. When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange (clastogenicity) and mouse lymphoma cell (mutagenicity) assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis). Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Candesartan Cilexetil - Hydrochlorothiazide Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2800 patients treated for hypertension. More than 750 of these patients were studied for at least six months and more than 500 patients were treated for at least one year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was comparable to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse experiences was not related to dose, age, gender, or race. In placebo-controlled trials that included 1089 patients treated with various combinations of candesartan cilexetil (doses of 2-32 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (doses of 6.25-25 mg) and 592 patients treated with placebo, adverse events, whether or not attributed to treatment, occurring in greater than 2% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and that were more frequent for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets than placebo were: Respiratory System Disorder: upper respiratory tract infection (3.6% vs 3.0%); Body as a Whole: back pain (3.3% vs 2.4%); influenza-like symptoms (2.5% vs 1.9%); Central/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness (2.9% vs 1.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience with candesartan cilexetil: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia.

In mice given single oral doses of the primary metabolite, candesartan, the minimum lethal dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg. Limited data are available in regard to overdosage with candesartan cilexetil in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. For hydrochlorothiazide, the most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily. Use in Renal Impairment: Dosing recommendations for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mg/min cannot be provided (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS , Renal Insufficiency ). Use in moderate to severe Hepatic Impairment: candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS , Hepatic Insufficiency ). Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve. A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil can expect incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 32 mg/12.5 mg and then 32 mg/25 mg. The maximal antihypertensive effect of any dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can be expected within 4 weeks of initiating that dose. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with or without food."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin -angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000- fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Pharmacokinetics General Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Hydrochlorothiazide When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. Metabolism and Excretion Candesartan Cilexetil Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Distribution Candesartan Cilexetil The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Special Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have not been investigated in patients <18 years of age. Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years). The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Gender There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Safety and effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL \u226430 ml/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild CrCL 60-90 ml/min) or moderate (CrCL 30-60) renal impairment. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The AUC for candesartan in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was increased 30% and 145% respectively. The C max for candesartan was increased 56% and 73% respectively. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Monitor patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma."

      "Pharmacodynamics Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once-daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Hydrochlorothiazide After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Clinical Trials Candesartan Cilexetil\u2013Hydrochlorothiazide Of 12 controlled clinical trials involving 4588 patients, 5 were double-blind, placebo controlled and evaluated the antihypertensive effects of single entities vs the combination. These 5 trials, of 8 to 12 weeks duration, randomized 3037 hypertensive patients. Doses ranged from 2 to 32 mg candesartan cilexetil and from 6.25 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide administered once daily in various combinations. The combination of candesartan cilexetil- hydrochlorothiazide resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 14-18/8-11 mm Hg at doses of 16 mg/12.5 mg and 32 mg/12.5 mg. The combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/25 mg resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 16-19/9-11 mm Hg. The placebo corrected trough to peak ratio was evaluated in a study of candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/12.5 mg and was 88%. Most of the antihypertensive effect of the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide was seen in 1 to 2 weeks with the full effect observed within 4 weeks. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was maintained. The antihypertensive effect was similar regardless of age or gender, and overall response to the combination was similar in black and non-black patients. No appreciable changes in heart rate were observed with combination therapy in controlled trials."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Candesartan cilexitil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Candesartan cilexitil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use .) There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. For mice, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1000 mg/kg/day (about 150 times the maximum recommended daily human dose [MRHD] 1 ). For rats, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 100 mg/kg/day (about 31 times the MRHD 1 ). For rabbits, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1 mg/kg/day (a maternally toxic dose that is about half the MRHD 1 ). In each of these studies, hydrochlorothiazide was tested at the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day, about 4, 8, and 15 times the MRHD 1 in mouse, rats, and rabbit, respectively). There was no evidence of harm to the rat or mouse fetus or embryo in studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was administered alone to the pregnant rat or mouse at doses of up to 1000 and 3000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. ______________________________ 1 Doses compared on the basis of body surface area. MRHD considered to be 32 mg for candesartan cilexetil and 12.5 mg for hydrochlorothiazide. Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide or volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with heart failure, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide may cause excessive hypotension, which may lead to oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death (see WARNINGS, Impaired Renal Function ). In such patients, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of candesartan or diuretic is increased. Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Potassium Abnormalities Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. In clinical trials of various doses of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 2.5% versus 2.1% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% versus 1.0% for placebo. No patient receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 16 mg/12.5 mg or 32 mg/12.5 mg was discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. Hypersensitivity Reaction Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevation of serum calcium. Avoid using candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablet in patients with hypercalcemia. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablet during- pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablet that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. Tell patients that if syncope occurs, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablet until the physician has been consulted. Tell all patients that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablet not to use potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels without consulting the prescribing physician. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening. DRUG INTERACTIONS Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Interactions common to both Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Lithium \u2212 Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use. Interactions with Candesartan Cilexetil Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Coadministration of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics - Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) - Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Diazoxide - the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. Ion Exchange resins - Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins. Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) - Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Digitalis - Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Noradrenaline - Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone - Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Cytotoxic products - Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. Cyclosporine - Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Candesartan cilexetil or candesartan (the active metabolite), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, tested positive in vitro in the Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay and mouse lymphoma mutagenicity assay. The candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide combination tested negative for mutagenicity in bacteria (Ames test), for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver, for chromosomal aberrations in rat bone marrow and for micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Both candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro CHL chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay, the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assays. When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange (clastogenicity) and mouse lymphoma cell (mutagenicity) assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay. Hydrochorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis). Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. PEDIATRIC USE Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Candesartan Cilexetil-Hydrochlorothiazide Candesartan cilexitil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets has been evaluated for safety in more than 2800 patients treated for hypertension. More than 750 of these patients were studied for at least six months and more than 500 patients were treated for at least one year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexitil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was comparable to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse experiences was not related to dose, age, gender, or race. In placebo-controlled trials that included 1089 patients treated with various combinations of candesartan cilexetil (doses of 2 mg to 32 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (doses of 6.25 mg -25 mg) and 592 patients treated with placebo, adverse events, whether or not attributed to treatment, occurring in greater than 2% of patients treated with candesartan cilexitil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and that were more frequent for candesartan cilexitil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets than placebo were: Respiratory System Disorder: upper respiratory tract infection (3.6% vs 3.0%); Body as a Whole: back pain (3.3% vs 2.4%); influenza-like symptoms (2.5% vs 1.9%); Central/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness (2.9% vs 1.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience with candesartan cilexetil: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria.

      "OVERDOSAGE Candesartan Cilexetil \u2013 Hydrochlorothiazide No lethality was observed in acute toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil or in rats given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil in combination with 1000 mg/kg of hydrochlorothiazide. In mice given single oral doses of the primary metabolite, candesartan, the minimum lethal dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg. Limited data are available in regard to overdosage with candesartan cilexetil in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. For hydrochlorothiazide, the most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. Treatment To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily. Use in Renal Impairment: Dosing recommendations for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mg/min cannot be provided (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS, Renal Insufficiency ). Use in moderate to severe Hepatic Impairment: Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given. (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS, Hepatic Insufficiency ). Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve. A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil can expect incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 32 mg/12.5 mg and then 32 mg/25 mg. The maximal antihypertensive effect of any dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can be expected within 4 weeks of initiating that dose. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with or without food."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u00b7 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1). \u00b7 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil tablets reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226440%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets also have an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 to 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to \u02c26 years) (2.2) 0.2 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to \u02c217 years) (2.2) <50 kg 4 to 8 mg tablet once daily >50 kg 8 to 16 mg tablet once daily <50 kg 4 to 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose >50 kg 4 to 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil tablet is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to <17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil tablets under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Children 1 to <6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.2 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to <17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to <6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to <17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets since candesartan cilexetil tablets has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use, Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (ten 16 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. Mix thoroughly. Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (5.3). \u00b7 Monitor renal function (5.4) and potassium levels (5.5). 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00b7 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: o Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) (6.1). o Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) (5.5). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo- controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to <6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to <17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u00b7 Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity (7). \u00b7 NSAIDs use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7). \u00b7 Dual inhibition of the renin- angiotension system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7) . \u2022 Combined inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7). 7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co\u00adadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u00b7 Nursing Mothers : Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2) . \u00b7 Pediatrics : Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2). Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to <17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once- daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u22658 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics has not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]."

Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assay.

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assay. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8 to 12/4 to 8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low\u00ad renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <6 years old and 6 to <17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to <6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6/5.2 to 12/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to <17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed <50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those >50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to <17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 to 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4 to 8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine \u22653 mg/dL, serum potassium \u22655.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM-Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2013 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67 to 0.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71 to 1.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57 to 0.81) <0.001 In CHARM-Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2. CHARM \u2013 Added: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n=1276) Placebo (n=1272) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 483 538 0.85 (0.75 to 0.96) 0.011 CV death 302 347 0.84 (0.72 to 0.98) 0.029 Heart failure hospitalization 309 356 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96) 0.014 In these two studies, the benefit of candesartan cilexetil in reducing the risk of CV death or heart failure hospitalization (18% p<0.001) was evident in major subgroups (see Figure), and in patients on other combinations of cardiovascular and heart failure treatments, including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions ( 1.1 ). \u2022 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil tablets reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets also have an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension ( 2.1 ) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 \u2013 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to < 6 years) ( 2.2 ) 0.20 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 \u2013 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to < 17 years) ( 2.2 ) < 50 kg 4 \u2013 8 mg tablet once daily < 50 kg 4 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose > 50 kg 8 \u2013 16 mg tablet once daily > 50 kg 4 \u2013 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure ( 2.3 ) 4 mg tablet once daily 32 mg tablet once daily The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil tablets is 16 mg once daily when they are used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Use in Hepatic Impairment Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil tablets under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Children 1 to < 6 Years of Age The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to < 17 Years of Age For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets since candesartan cilexetil tablets have not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u2022 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u2022 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u2022 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u2022 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u2022 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u2022 Mix thoroughly. \u2022 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u2022 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Monitor renal function ( 5.4 ) and potassium levels ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil tablets, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil tablets. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil tablets versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil tablet-treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil tablets, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil tablets. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil tablet-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil tablets with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil tablet-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: o Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) ( 6.1 ). o Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) ( 5.3 ), abnormal renal function (6.3%) ( 5.4 ), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) ( 5.5 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil tablets was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil tablets were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to < 6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to < 17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil tablets in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil tablets in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n = 3803) with placebo (n = 3796), 21.0% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil tablets for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity ( 7 ). \u2022 NSAIDs use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect ( 7 ). \u2022 Combined inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia ( 7 ). 7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil tablets. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil tablets with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Nursing Mothers: Either nursing or drug should be discontinued ( 8.2 ). \u2022 Pediatrics: Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension ( 5.2 ). Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals ( 12.3 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u2265 10 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u2265 10 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (> 10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u2265 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to < 6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children > 6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children < 1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil tablet pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil tablets at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil tablets were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8-12/4-8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil tablets were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to < 6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.20 or 0.40 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6.0/5.2 to 12.0/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to < 17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil tablets in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed < 50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil tablets were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those > 50 kg the candesartan cilexetil tablets doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to < 17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1-6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil tablets. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II-IV heart failure and LVEF \u2264 40%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil tablets (initially 4-8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine \u2265 3 mg/dL, serum potassium \u2265 5.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM\u2013Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil tablets was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil tablets (p < 0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM\u2014Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil Tablets (n = 1013) Placebo (n = 1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67\u20130.89) < 0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71\u20131.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57\u20130.81) < 0.001 In CHARM\u2013Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil tablets or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil tablets was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil tablets (p = 0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil tablets. Table 2. CHARM\u2014Added: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil Tablets ( n = 1276) Placebo (n = 1272) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 483 538 0.85 (0.75\u20130.96) 0.011 CV death 302 347 0.84 (0.72\u20130.98) 0.029 Heart failure hospitalization 309 356 0.83 (0.71\u20130.96) 0.014 In these two studies, the benefit of candesartan cilexetil tablets in reducing the risk of CV death or heart failure hospitalization (18% p < 0.001) was evident in major subgroups (see Figure), and in patients on other combinations of cardiovascular and heart failure treatments, including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u00b7 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1). \u00b7 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil tablets reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226440%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets also have an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 to 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to \u02c26 years) (2.2) 0.2 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to \u02c217 years) (2.2) <50 kg 4 to 8 mg tablet once daily >50 kg 8 to 16 mg tablet once daily <50 kg 4 to 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose >50 kg 4 to 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient. 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil tablet is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to <17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil tablets under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Children 1 to <6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.2 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to <17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to <6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to <17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets since candesartan cilexetil tablets has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use, Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (ten 16 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. Mix thoroughly. Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (5.3). \u00b7 Monitor renal function (5.4) and potassium levels (5.5). 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Candesartan cilexetil tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00b7 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: o Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) (6.1). o Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) (5.5). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo- controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to <6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to <17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough. Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co\u00adadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u00b7 Nursing Mothers : Either nursing or drug should be discontinued (8.2) . \u00b7 Pediatrics : Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension (5.2). Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal abnormalities in neonatal animals (12.3) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil is toxic to rabbits. When given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), candesartan cilexetil caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 8.2 Lactation It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with candesartan cilexetil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <17 years of age in randomized, double-blind clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 to <17 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Candesartan cilexetil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Pregnant women with chronic heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Heart failure may worsen with pregnancy and may lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, hyperkalemia or other symptoms of renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Animal Data Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg).

In mice given single oral doses of the primary metabolite, candesartan, the minimum lethal dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg. The most likely manifestation of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Treatment: To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1) - 1 - Hydroxyethyl 2 - ethoxy - 1 - [ p - ( o - 1 H - tetrazol - 5\u00ad ylphenyl) benzyl] - 7 -benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is Candesartan cilexetil, USP is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablets containing 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil, USP and the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, corn starch, polyethylene glycol 8000, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate. Ferric oxide red is added to the 8-mg and 16-mg tablets as a colorant."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once- daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u22658 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics has not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8 to 12/4 to 8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low\u00ad renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <6 years old and 6 to <17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to <6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6/5.2 to 12/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to <17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed <50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those >50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to <17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 to 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4 to 8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine \u22653 mg/dL, serum potassium \u22655.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM-Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2013 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67 to 0.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71 to 1.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57 to 0.81) <0.001 In CHARM-Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2. CHARM \u2013 Added: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n=1276) Placebo (n=1272) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 483 538 0.85 (0.75 to 0.96) 0.011 CV death 302 347 0.84 (0.72 to 0.98) 0.029 Heart failure hospitalization 309 356 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96) 0.014 In these two studies, the benefit of candesartan cilexetil in reducing the risk of CV death or heart failure hospitalization (18% p<0.001) was evident in major subgroups (see Figure), and in patients on other combinations of cardiovascular and heart failure treatments, including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

      "DESCRIPTION Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets USP combine an angiotensin II receptor (type AT 1 ) antagonist and a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1)-1-Hydroxyethyl 2-ethoxy-1-[ p -( o -1 H -tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]-7-benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 and its structural formula is: Candesartan cilexetil is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Hydrochlorothiazide is 6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2 H -1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide. Its empirical formula is C 7 H 8 ClN 3 O 4 S 2 and its structural formula is: Hydrochlorothiazide is a white, or practically white, crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 297.72, which is slightly soluble in water, but freely soluble in sodium hydroxide solution. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are available for oral administration in three tablet strengths of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contain 16 mg or 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil and 12.5 mg or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide providing for the following available combinations: 16 mg/12.5 mg, 32 mg/12.5 mg or 32 mg/25 mg. The inactive ingredients of the tablets are carboxymethylcellulose calcium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, corn starch, polyethylene glycol 8000, and ferric oxide (yellow). Ferric oxide (reddish brown) is also added to the 16 mg/12.5 mg and 32 mg/25 mg tablets as colorant. Chemical Structure for Candesartan cilexetil Chemical Structure for Hydrochlorothiazide"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co\u2011administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Pharmacokinetics General Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Hydrochlorothiazide When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. Metabolism and Excretion Candesartan Cilexetil Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Distribution Candesartan Cilexetil The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Special Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have not been investigated in patients <18 years of age. Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years). The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Safety and effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL \u226430 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCL 60-90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCL 30-60 mL/min) renal impairment. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The AUC for candesartan in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was increased 30% and 145% respectively. The C max for candesartan was increased 56% and 73% respectively. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Monitor patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Pharmacodynamics Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once-daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Hydrochlorothiazide After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Clinical Trials Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Of 12 controlled clinical trials involving 4588 patients, 5 were double-blind, placebo controlled and evaluated the antihypertensive effects of single entities vs the combination. These 5 trials, of 8 to 12 weeks duration, randomized 3037 hypertensive patients. Doses ranged from 2 to 32 mg candesartan cilexetil and from 6.25 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide administered once daily in various combinations. The combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 14-18/8-11 mm Hg at doses of 16 mg/12.5 mg and 32 mg/12.5 mg. The combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/25 mg resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 16-19/9-11 mm Hg. The placebo corrected trough to peak ratio was evaluated in a study of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/12.5 mg and was 88%. Most of the antihypertensive effect of the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide was seen in 1 to 2 weeks with the full effect observed within 4 weeks. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was maintained. The antihypertensive effect was similar regardless of age or gender, and overall response to the combination was similar in black and non-black patients. No appreciable changes in heart rate were observed with combination therapy in controlled trials."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co\u2011administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. For mice, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1000 mg/kg/day (about 150 times the maximum recommended daily human dose [MRHD] Doses compared on the basis of body surface area. MRHD considered to be 32 mg for candesartan cilexetil and 12.5 mg for hydrochlorothiazide. ). For rats, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 100 mg/kg/day (about 31 times the MRHD 1 ). For rabbits, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1 mg/kg/day (a maternally toxic dose that is about half the MRHD 1 ). In each of these studies, hydrochlorothiazide was tested at the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day, about 4, 8, and 15 times the MRHD 1 in mouse, rats, and rabbit, respectively). There was no evidence of harm to the rat or mouse fetus or embryo in studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was administered alone to the pregnant rat or mouse at doses of up to 1000 and 3000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets or volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with heart failure, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may cause excessive hypotension, which may lead to oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death (see WARNINGS, Impaired Renal Function ). In such patients, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of candesartan or diuretic is increased. Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Potassium Abnormalities Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia, which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. In clinical trials of various doses of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 2.5% versus 2.1% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% versus 1.0% for placebo. No patient receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg or 32 mg/12.5 mg was discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. Hypersensitivity Reaction Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history."

      "PRECAUTIONS Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevation of serum calcium. Avoid using candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with hypercalcemia. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Information for Patients Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. Tell patients that if syncope occurs, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets until the physician has been consulted. Tell all patients that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets not to use potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels without consulting the prescribing physician. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening. Drug Interactions Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Interactions common to both Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use. Interactions with Candesartan Cilexetil Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics \u2212 Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) \u2212 Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Diazoxide \u2212 the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. Ion Exchange resins \u2212 Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins. Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) \u2212 Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Digitalis \u2212 Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Noradrenaline \u2013 Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone \u2013 Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Cytotoxic products \u2013 Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. Cyclosporine \u2212 Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Candesartan cilexetil or candesartan (the active metabolite), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, tested positive in vitro in the Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay and mouse lymphoma mutagenicity assay. The candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide combination tested negative for mutagenicity in bacteria (Ames test), for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver, for chromosomal aberrations in rat bone marrow and for micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Both candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro CHL chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay, the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assays. When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange (clastogenicity) and mouse lymphoma cell (mutagenicity) assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis). Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

Interactions with Candesartan Cilexetil Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics \u2212 Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) \u2212 Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Diazoxide \u2212 the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. Ion Exchange resins \u2212 Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins. Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) \u2212 Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Digitalis \u2212 Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Noradrenaline \u2013 Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone \u2013 Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Cytotoxic products \u2013 Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. Cyclosporine \u2212 Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Candesartan cilexetil or candesartan (the active metabolite), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, tested positive in vitro in the Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay and mouse lymphoma mutagenicity assay. The candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide combination tested negative for mutagenicity in bacteria (Ames test), for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver, for chromosomal aberrations in rat bone marrow and for micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Both candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro CHL chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay, the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assays. When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange (clastogenicity) and mouse lymphoma cell (mutagenicity) assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis). Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2800 patients treated for hypertension. More than 750 of these patients were studied for at least six months and more than 500 patients were treated for at least one year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was comparable to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse experiences was not related to dose, age, gender, or race. In placebo-controlled trials that included 1089 patients treated with various combinations of candesartan cilexetil (doses of 2-32 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (doses of 6.25-25 mg) and 592 patients treated with placebo, adverse events, whether or not attributed to treatment, occurring in greater than 2% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and that were more frequent for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets than placebo were: Respiratory System Disorder: upper respiratory tract infection (3.6% vs 3.0%); Body as a Whole: back pain (3.3% vs 2.4%); influenza-like symptoms (2.5% vs 1.9%); Central/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness (2.9% vs 1.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience with candesartan cilexetil: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse experiences that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, constipation, gastric irritation, anorexia Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, photosensitivity, urticaria, purpura Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of \u226550,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide No lethality was observed in acute toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil or in rats given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil in combination with 1000 mg/kg of hydrochlorothiazide. In mice given single oral doses of the primary metabolite, candesartan, the minimum lethal dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg. Limited data are available in regard to overdosage with candesartan cilexetil in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. For hydrochlorothiazide, the most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. Treatment To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference (PDR) . In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and altered pharmacokinetics in your patient."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily. Use in Renal Impairment: Dosing recommendations for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mg/min cannot be provided (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS, Renal Insufficiency ). Use in moderate to severe Hepatic Impairment: Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS, Hepatic Insufficiency ). Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve. A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil tablets can expect incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 32 mg/12.5 mg and then 32 mg/25 mg. The maximal antihypertensive effect of any dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can be expected within 4 weeks of initiating that dose. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with or without food."

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1). \u00b7 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil tablets reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2) 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226440%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets also have an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 to 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to \u02c26 years) (2.2) 0.2 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to \u02c217 years) (2.2) <50 kg 4 to 8 mg tablet once daily >50 kg 8 to 16 mg tablet once daily <50 kg 4 to 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose >50 kg 4 to 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil tablet is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to <17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil tablets under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Children 1 to <6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.2 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to <17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to <6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to <17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets since candesartan cilexetil tablets has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u00b7 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use, Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u00b7 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (five 32 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u00b7 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u00b7 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u00b7 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u00b7 Mix thoroughly. \u00b7 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u00b7 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00b7 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: o Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) (6.1). o Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) (5.5). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo- controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to <6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to <17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory system disorders: Cough Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co\u00adadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min) [see Contraindications (4)]."

Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue candesartan cilexetil, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of candesartan cilexetil on labor and delivery in humans is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue candesartan cilexetil, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once- daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u22658 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics: Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics has not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]."

Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8 to 12/4 to 8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low\u00ad renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <6 years old and 6 to <17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to <6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6/5.2 to 12/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to <17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed <50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those >50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to <17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 to 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4 to 8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine \u22653 mg/dL, serum potassium \u22655.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM-Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2013 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67 to 0.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71 to 1.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57 to 0.81) <0.001 In CHARM-Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2. CHARM \u2013 Added: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n=1276) Placebo (n=1272) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 483 538 0.85 (0.75 to 0.96) 0.011 CV death 302 347 0.84 (0.72 to 0.98) 0.029 Heart failure hospitalization 309 356 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96) 0.014 In these two studies, the benefit of candesartan cilexetil in reducing the risk of CV death or heart failure hospitalization (18% p<0.001) was evident in major subgroups (see Figure), and in patients on other combinations of cardiovascular and heart failure treatments, including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u00b7 Treatment of hypertension in adults and children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1). \u00b7 Treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV); candesartan cilexetil tablets reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (1.2). 1.1 Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to <17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Heart Failure Candesartan cilexetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in adults with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226440%) to reduce cardiovascular death and to reduce heart failure hospitalizations [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets also have an added effect on these outcomes when used with an ACE inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Starting Dose Target Dose Adult Hypertension (2.1) 16 mg tablet once daily 8 to 32 mg tablet total daily dose Pediatric Hypertension (1 to \u02c26 years) (2.2) 0.2 mg/kg oral suspension once daily 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg oral suspension once daily or consider divided dose Pediatric Hypertension (6 to \u02c217 years) (2.2) <50 kg 4 to 8 mg tablet once daily >50 kg 8 to 16 mg tablet once daily <50 kg 4 to 16 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose >50 kg 4 to 32 mg tablet once daily or consider divided dose Adult Heart Failure (2.3) 4 mg tablet once daily 1 The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by patient 2.1 Adult Hypertension Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil tablet is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil tablets in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to <17 Years of Age Candesartan cilexetil tablets may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil tablets under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Children 1 to <6 years of age: The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.2 mg/kg (oral suspension). Children 6 to <17 years of age: For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg. For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg. Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to <6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to <17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil tablets. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets for hypertension. All pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 should not receive candesartan cilexetil tablets since candesartan cilexetil tablets has not been studied in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. For children who cannot swallow tablets, an oral suspension may be substituted as described below: Preparation of Oral Suspension: Candesartan cilexetil oral suspension can be prepared in concentrations within the range of 0.1 to 2 mg/mL. Typically, a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be suitable for the prescribed dose. Any strength of candesartan cilexetil tablets can be used in the preparation of the suspension. Follow the steps below for preparation of the suspension. The number of tablets and volume of vehicle specified below will yield 160 mL of a 1 mg/mL suspension. \u00b7 Prepare the vehicle by adding equal volumes of Ora-Plus \u00ae (80 mL) and Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae (80 mL) or, alternatively, use, Ora-Blend SF \u00ae (160 mL). \u00b7 Add a small amount of vehicle to the required number of candesartan cilexetil tablets (ten 16 mg tablets) and grind into a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. \u00b7 Add the paste to a preparation vessel of suitable size. \u00b7 Rinse the mortar and pestle clean using the vehicle and add this to the vessel. Repeat, if necessary. \u00b7 Prepare the final volume by adding the remaining vehicle. \u00b7 Mix thoroughly. \u00b7 Dispense into suitably sized amber PET bottles. \u00b7 Label with an expiry date of 100 days and include the following instructions: Store at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F). Use within 30 days after first opening. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the bottle. Do not freeze. Shake well before each use. 2.3 Adult Heart Failure The recommended initial dose for treating heart failure is 4 mg once daily. The target dose is 32 mg once daily, which is achieved by doubling the dose at approximately 2-week intervals, as tolerated by the patient."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (5.3). \u00b7 Monitor renal function (5.4) and potassium levels (5.5). 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Oral doses \u226510 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day administered to pregnant rats during late gestation and continued through lactation were associated with reduced survival and an increased incidence of hydronephrosis in the offspring. The 10-mg/kg/day dose in rats is approximately 2.8 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 32 mg on a mg/m 2 basis (comparison assumes human body weight of 50 kg). Candesartan cilexetil given to pregnant rabbits at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) caused maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and death) but, in surviving dams, had no adverse effects on fetal survival, fetal weight, or external, visceral, or skeletal development. No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on fetal development were observed when oral doses up to 1000 mg of candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (approximately 138 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) were administered to pregnant mice. 5.2 Morbidity in Infants Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can have effects on the development of immature kidneys. 5.3 Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil, diuretic or both, and volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), hypotension was reported in 18.8% of patients on candesartan cilexetil versus 9.8% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hypotension leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 4.1% compared with 2% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, hypotension was reported in 22.6% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 13.8% treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during dose escalation and periodically thereafter. Major Surgery/Anesthesia Hypotension may occur during major surgery and anesthesia in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patient with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia or acute renal failure when treated with candesartan cilexetil. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil -treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of candesartan cilexetil with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically. In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of hyperkalemia was 6.3% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 2.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of hyperkalemia leading to drug discontinuation in candesartan cilexetil-treated patients was 2.4% compared with 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of hyperkalemia was 9.5% in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00b7 Most common adverse reactions which caused adult patients to discontinue therapy for: o Hypertension were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%) (6.1). o Heart Failure were hypotension (4.1%) (5.3), abnormal renal function (6.3%) (5.4), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) (5.5). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Hypertension Candesartan cilexetil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3600 patients/subjects, including more than 3200 patients treated for hypertension. About 600 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and about 200 for at least 1 year. In general, treatment with candesartan cilexetil was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil was similar to placebo. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials in patients (7510 total) was 3.3% (i.e., 108 of 3260) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy and 3.5% (i.e., 39 of 1106) of patients treated with placebo. In placebo- controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurred in 2.4% (i.e., 57 of 2350) of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and 3.4% (i.e., 35 of 1027) of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with candesartan cilexetil were headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%). The adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 1% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and at a higher incidence in candesartan cilexetil (n = 2350) than placebo (n = 1027) patients included back pain (3% vs. 2%), dizziness (4% vs. 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (2% vs. 1%), and rhinitis (2% vs. 1%). Pediatric Hypertension Among children in clinical studies, 1 in 93 children age 1 to <6 and 3 in 240 age 6 to <17 experienced worsening renal disease. The association between candesartan and exacerbation of the underlying condition could not be excluded. Heart Failure The adverse event profile of candesartan cilexetil in adult heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. In the CHARM program, comparing candesartan cilexetil in total daily doses up to 32 mg once daily (n=3803) with placebo (n=3796), 21% of patients discontinued candesartan cilexetil for adverse events vs. 16.1% of placebo patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of candesartan cilexetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience: Digestive: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory system disorders: Cough Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers."

Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil. Monitor serum lithium levels. 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co\u00adadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Triple combination of candesartan cilexetil with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes.

Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue candesartan cilexetil, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Candesartan cilexetil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan is a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan cilexetil, a nonpeptide, is chemically described as (\u00b1) - 1 - Hydroxyethyl 2 - ethoxy - 1 - [ p - ( o - 1 H - tetrazol - 5\u00ad ylphenyl) benzyl] - 7 -benzimidazolecarboxylate, cyclohexyl carbonate (ester). Its empirical formula is C 33 H 34 N 6 O 6 , and its structural formula is: Candesartan cilexetil, USP is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 610.67. It is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Candesartan cilexetil is a racemic mixture containing one chiral center at the cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy ethyl ester group. Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil undergoes hydrolysis at the ester link to form the active drug, candesartan, which is achiral. Candesartan cilexetil is available for oral use as tablets containing 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil, USP and the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, corn starch, polyethylene glycol 8000, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, and magnesium stearate.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once- daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u22658 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics: Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics has not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]."

After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once- daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Hypertension Adults In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Heart Failure In heart failure patients, candesartan \u22658 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Metabolism and Excretion Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Adults Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Pediatrics In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose. Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg. Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. The pharmacokinetics (C max and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight. Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development. RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development. Geriatric and Sex The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u226565 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC 0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. C max was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Pediatrics: Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics has not been determined in children with renal insufficiency. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The increase in C max for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg. After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients. The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage, whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assays and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assay. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hypertension Adult The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were examined in 14 placebo-controlled trials of 4- to 12-weeks duration, primarily at daily doses of 2 to 32 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Most of the trials were of candesartan cilexetil as a single agent, but it was also studied as add-on to hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. These studies included a total of 2350 patients randomized to one of several doses of candesartan cilexetil and 1027 to placebo. Except for a study in diabetics, all studies showed significant effects, generally dose related, of 2 to 32 mg on trough (24 hour) systolic and diastolic pressures compared to placebo, with doses of 8 to 32 mg giving effects of about 8 to 12/4 to 8 mm Hg. There were no exaggerated first-dose effects in these patients. Most of the antihypertensive effect was seen within 2 weeks of initial dosing and the full effect in 4 weeks. With once-daily dosing, blood pressure effect was maintained over 24 hours, with trough to peak ratios of blood pressure effect generally over 80%. Candesartan cilexetil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses administered once-daily were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg on average more than losartan potassium 100 mg, when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied. The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low\u00ad renin population). This has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials. Pediatric The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil were evaluated in hypertensive children 1 to <6 years old and 6 to <17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind multicenter, 4-week dose ranging studies. There were 93 patients 1 to <6 years of age, 74% of whom had renal disease, that were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil suspension 0.05, 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg once daily. The primary method of analysis was slope of the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a function of dose. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased 6/5.2 to 12/11.1 mmHg from baseline across the three doses of candesartan. In children 6 to <17 years, 240 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or low, medium, or high doses of candesartan cilexetil in a ratio of 1: 2: 2: 2. For children who weighed <50 kg the doses of candesartan cilexetil were 2, 8, or 16 mg once daily. For those >50 kg the candesartan cilexetil doses were 4, 16 or 32 mg once daily. Those enrolled were 47% Black and 29% were female; mean age +/- SD was 12.9 +/- 2.6 years. The placebo subtracted effect at trough for sitting systolic blood pressure/sitting diastolic blood pressure for the different doses were from 4.9/3.0 to 7.5/6.2 mmHg. In children 6 to <17 years there was a trend for a lesser blood pressure effect for Blacks compared to other patients. There were too few individuals in the age group of 1 to 6 years old to determine whether Blacks respond differently than other patients to candesartan cilexetil. 14.2 Heart Failure Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM\u2013Alternative), 2. CHARM\u2013Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II - IV heart failure and LVEF \u226440%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4 to 8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine \u22653 mg/dL, serum potassium \u22655.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. CHARM-Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 34 months, there was a 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p<0.001), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 1). Table 1. CHARM \u2013 Alternative: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n= 1013) Placebo (n=1015) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 334 406 0.77 (0.67 to 0.89) <0.001 CV death 219 252 0.85 (0.71 to 1.02) 0.072 Heart failure hospitalization 207 286 0.68 (0.57 to 0.81) <0.001 In CHARM-Added, 2548 subjects receiving an ACE inhibitor were randomized to candesartan cilexetil or placebo. The specific ACE inhibitor and dose were at the discretion of the investigators, who were encouraged to titrate patients to doses known to be effective in clinical outcome trials, subject to patient tolerability. Forced titration to maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor was not required. The mean age was 64 years and 21% were female, 24% were NYHA II, 73% were NYHA III, 3% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 28%. Fifty-six percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 48% had a history of hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline in addition to ACE inhibitors were diuretics (90%), digoxin (58%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (17%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 24 mg and 61% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily. After a median follow-up of 41 months, there was a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization on candesartan cilexetil (p=0.011), with both components contributing to the overall effect (Table 2). There was no evident relationship between dose of ACE inhibitor and the benefit of candesartan cilexetil. Table 2. CHARM \u2013 Added: Primary Endpoint and its Components Endpoint (time to first event) Candesartan Cilexetil (n=1276) Placebo (n=1272) Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value (logrank) CV death or heart failure hospitalization 483 538 0.85 (0.75 to 0.96) 0.011 CV death 302 347 0.84 (0.72 to 0.98) 0.029 Heart failure hospitalization 309 356 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96) 0.014 In these two studies, the benefit of candesartan cilexetil in reducing the risk of CV death or heart failure hospitalization (18% p<0.001) was evident in major subgroups (see Figure), and in patients on other combinations of cardiovascular and heart failure treatments, including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT 2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT 2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (> 10,000-fold) for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Pharmacokinetics General Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT 1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (C max ) is reached after 3 to 4 hours. Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration. Hydrochlorothiazide When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. Metabolism and Excretion Candesartan Cilexetil Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg. When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces. Following an intravenous dose of 14 C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces. Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Distribution Candesartan Cilexetil The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Special Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil have not been investigated in patients < 18 years of age. Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (\u2265 65 years). The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (C max was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Gender There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects. Renal Insufficiency In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and C max were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Safety and effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL \u2264 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCL 60-90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCL 30-60 mL/min) renal impairment. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil. The AUC for candesartan in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was increased 30% and 145% respectively. The C max for candesartan was increased 56% and 73% respectively. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Monitor patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Pharmacodynamics Candesartan Cilexetil Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 week of once-daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Hydrochlorothiazide After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Clinical Trials Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Of 12 controlled clinical trials involving 4588 patients, 5 were double-blind, placebo-controlled and evaluated the antihypertensive effects of single entities vs the combination. These 5 trials, of 8 to 12 weeks duration, randomized 3037 hypertensive patients. Doses ranged from 2 to 32 mg candesartan cilexetil and from 6.25 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide administered once daily in various combinations. The combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 14-18/8-11 mmHg at doses of 16 mg/12.5 mg and 32 mg/12.5 mg. The combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/25 mg resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 16-19/9-11 mmHg. The placebo corrected trough to peak ratio was evaluated in a study of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide 32 mg/12.5 mg and was 88%. Most of the antihypertensive effect of the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide was seen in 1 to 2 weeks with the full effect observed within 4 weeks. In long-term studies of up to 1 year, the blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was maintained. The antihypertensive effect was similar regardless of age or gender, and overall response to the combination was similar in black and non-black patients. No appreciable changes in heart rate were observed with combination therapy in controlled trials."

Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration. The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients. In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid. In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA 1c . Hydrochlorothiazide After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. (See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use .) There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. For mice, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1000 mg/kg/day (about 150 times the maximum recommended daily human dose [MRHD] 1 ). For rats, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 100 mg/kg/day (about 31 times the MRHD 1 ). For rabbits, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1 mg/kg/day (a maternally toxic dose that is about half the MRHD 1 ). In each of these studies, hydrochlorothiazide was tested at the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day, about 4, 8, and 15 times the MRHD 1 in mouse, rats, and rabbit, respectively). There was no evidence of harm to the rat or mouse fetus or embryo in studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was administered alone to the pregnant rat or mouse at doses of up to 1000 and 3000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. ___________________ 1 Doses compared on the basis of body surface area. MRHD considered to be 32 mg for candesartan cilexetil and 12.5 mg for hydrochlorothiazide. Hypotension Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets or volume repletion. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with heart failure, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may cause excessive hypotension, which may lead to oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death (see WARNINGS: Impaired Renal Function ). In such patients, candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of candesartan or diuretic is increased. Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Potassium Abnormalities Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. In clinical trials of various doses of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.5% versus 2.1% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% versus 1.0% for placebo. No patient receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg or 32 mg/12.5 mg was discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. Hypersensitivity Reaction Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevation of serum calcium. Avoid using candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with hypercalcemia. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Information for Patients Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. Tell patients that if syncope occurs, discontinue candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets until the physician has been consulted. Tell all patients that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Tell patients receiving candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets not to use potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels without consulting the prescribing physician. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening. Drug Interactions Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Interactions Common to Both Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use. Interactions with Candesartan Cilexetil Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Diazoxide The hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. Ion Exchange Resins Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine) Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Digitalis Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Noradrenaline Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Cytotoxic Products Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. Cyclosporine Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when candesartan cilexetil was orally administered to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks at doses up to 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Rats received the drug by gavage whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These (maximally-tolerated) doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan (AUCs) that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose (32 mg). Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Candesartan cilexetil or candesartan (the active metabolite), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, tested positive in vitro in the Chinese hamster lung (CHL) chromosomal aberration assay and mouse lymphoma mutagenicity assay. The candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide combination tested negative for mutagenicity in bacteria (Ames test), for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver, for chromosomal aberrations in rat bone marrow and for micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Both candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro CHL chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan (but not its O-deethyl metabolite) was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay, the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. Candesartan cilexetil was not evaluated in the CHL chromosomal aberration or CHO gene mutation assays. When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange (clastogenicity) and mouse lymphoma cell (mutagenicity) assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given oral doses of up to 300 mg candesartan cilexetil/kg/day (83 times the maximum daily human dose of 32 mg on a body surface area basis). Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a History of In Utero Exposure to Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2800 patients treated for hypertension. More than 750 of these patients were studied for at least six months and more than 500 patients were treated for at least one year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was comparable to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse experiences was not related to dose, age, gender, or race. In placebo-controlled trials that included 1089 patients treated with various combinations of candesartan cilexetil (doses of 2-32 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (doses of 6.25-25 mg) and 592 patients treated with placebo, adverse events, whether or not attributed to treatment, occurring in greater than 2% of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and that were more frequent for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets than placebo were: Respiratory System Disorder: upper respiratory tract infection (3.6% vs 3.0%); Body as a Whole: back pain (3.3% vs 2.4%); influenza-like symptoms (2.5% vs 1.9%); Central/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness (2.9% vs 1.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience with candesartan cilexetil: Digestive : Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Hematologic : Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Immunologic: Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia. Respiratory System Disorders: Cough Skin and Appendages Disorders : Pruritus, rash and urticaria. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse experiences that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, constipation, gastric irritation, anorexia Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, photosensitivity, urticaria, purpura Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of \u2265 50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.

      "OVERDOSAGE Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide No lethality was observed in acute toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil or in rats given single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg of candesartan cilexetil in combination with 1000 mg/kg of hydrochlorothiazide. In mice given single oral doses of the primary metabolite, candesartan, the minimum lethal dose was greater than 1000 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg. Limited data are available in regard to overdosage with candesartan cilexetil in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. For hydrochlorothiazide, the most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. Treatment To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference (PDR) . In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and altered pharmacokinetics in your patient."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily. Use in Renal Impairment Dosing recommendations for candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mg/min cannot be provided (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Renal Insufficiency ). Use in Moderate to Severe Hepatic Impairment Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS, Hepatic Insufficiency ). Replacement Therapy The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 16 mg/12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve. A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil can expect incremental blood pressure effects from candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 32 mg/12.5 mg and then 32 mg/25 mg. The maximal antihypertensive effect of any dose of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can be expected within 4 weeks of initiating that dose. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with or without food."
