      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate. Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SE) = Standard error of the mean 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SD) = Standard Deviation 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and intravenous desmopressin acetate have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m2) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See WARNINGS .)"

In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See WARNINGS .)"

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate tablets and injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. Central Diabetes Insipidus In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The only adverse event occurring in \u22653% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo). Other The following adverse events have been reported; however their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain. See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia. Post Marketing There have been rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine."

      "OVERDOSAGE Signs of overdose may include confusion, drowsiness, continuing headache, problems with passing urine and rapid weight gain due to fluid retention. (See WARNINGS .) In case of overdose, the dose should be reduced, frequency of administration decreased, or the drug withdrawn according to the severity of the condition. There is no known specific antidote for desmopressin acetate. The patient should be observed and treated with appropriate symptomatic therapy. An oral LD 50 has not been established. Oral doses up to 0.2 mg/kg/day have been administered to dogs and rats for 6 months without any significant drug-related toxicities reported. An intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg in mice demonstrated no effect."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINCAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Discard unused portion. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4)] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.2)] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4)] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

( 7.1 ) Other vasoconstrictors: May require a reduction of the desmopressin acetate dosage. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Other Drugs that may Increase Risk of Hyponatremia The concomitant administration of desmopressin acetate injection with other drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine, sulfonylureas, particularly chlorpropamide, oxybutynin and carbamazepine), requires more frequent serum sodium monitoring. Monitor serum sodium more frequently in patients taking desmopressin acetate injection concomitantly with these drugs and when doses of these drugs are increased [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. 7.2 Other Vasoconstrictors Desmopressin acetate injection can elevate blood pressure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1 . Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration. ( 2 ) 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ]. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4) ]. If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4) ]. It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration. ( 2 ) 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ]. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4) ]. If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4) ]. It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL contains as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. One mL (4 mcg) of Desmopressin Acetate Injection(desmopressin acetate) solution has an antidiuretic activity of about 16 IU; 1 mcg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection is equivalent to 4 IU. Desmopressin Acetate Injection has been shown to be more potent than arginine vasopressin in increasing plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. Dose-response studies were performed in healthy persons, using doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mcg/kg body weight, infused over a 10-minute period. Maximal dose response occurred at 0.3 to 0.4 mcg/kg. The response to Desmopressin Acetate Injection of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent of initial concentrations obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg body weight. The increase is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The factor VIII related antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were also increased to a smaller degree, but still are dose-dependent. 1. The biphasic half-lives of Desmopressin Acetate Injection were 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the fast and slow phases, respectively, compared with 2.5 and 14.5 minutes for lysine vasopressin, another form of the hormone. As a result, Desmopressin Acetate Injection provides a prompt onset of antidiuretic action with a long duration after each administration. 2. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to Desmopressin Acetate Injection has resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 3. When administered by injection, Desmopressin Acetate Injection has an antidiuretic effect about ten times that of an equivalent dose administered intranasally. 4. The bioavailability of the subcutaneous route of administration was determined qualitatively using urine output data. The exact fraction of drug absorbed by that route of administration has not been quantitatively determined. 5. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection infused over 10 minutes. 6. Plasminogen activator activity increases rapidly after Desmopressin Acetate Injection infusion, but there has been no clinically significant fibrinolysis in patients treated with Desmopressin Acetate Injection. 7. The effect of repeated Desmopressin Acetate Injection administration when doses were given every 12 to 24 hours has generally shown a gradual diminution of the factor VIII activity increase noted with a single dose. The initial response is reproducible in any particular patient if there are 2 or 3 days between administrations. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin Acetate Injection is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in Desmopressin Acetate Injection terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . )"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hemophilia A: Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated for patients with hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels greater than 5%. Desmopressin Acetate Injection will often maintain hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A during surgical procedures and postoperatively when administered 30 minutes prior to scheduled procedure. Desmopressin Acetate Injection will also stop bleeding in hemophilia A patients with episodes of spontaneous or trauma-induced injuries such as hemarthroses, intramuscular hematomas or mucosal bleeding. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is not indicated for the treatment of hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels equal to or less than 5%, or for the treatment of hemophilia B, or in patients who have factor VIII antibodies. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrands Disease (Type I): Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated for patients with mild to moderate classic von Willebrands disease (Type I) with factor VIII levels greater than 5%. Desmopressin Acetate Injection will often maintain hemostasis in patients with mild to moderate von Willebrands disease during surgical procedures and postoperatively when administered 30 minutes prior to the scheduled procedure. Desmopressin Acetate Injection will usually stop bleeding in mild to moderate von Willebrands patients with episodes of spontaneous or trauma-induced injuries such as hemarthroses, intramuscular hematomas or mucosal bleeding. Those von Willebrands disease patients who are least likely to respond are those with severe homozygous von Willebrands disease with factor VIII coagulant activity and factor VIII von Willebrand factor antigen levels less than 1%. Other patients may respond in a variable fashion depending on the type of molecular defect they have. Bleeding time and factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand factor antigen should be checked during administration of Desmopressin Acetate Injection to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is not indicated for the treatment of severe classic von Willebrands disease (Type I) and when there is evidence of an abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. (See WARNINGS . ) Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central (cranial) diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is also available as an intranasal preparation. However, this means of delivery can be compromised by a variety of factors that can make nasal insufflation ineffective or inappropriate. These include poor intranasal absorption, nasal congestion and blockage, nasal discharge, atrophy of nasal mucosa, and severe atrophic rhinitis. Intranasal delivery may be inappropriate where there is an impaired level of consciousness. In addition, cranial surgical procedures, such as transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, create situations where an alternative route of administration is needed as in cases of nasal packing or recovery from surgery."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS 1. Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with Desmopressin Acetate Injection (desmopressin acetate). Desmopressin Acetate Injection is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/ or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. 2. When Desmopressin Acetate Injection is administered to patients who do not have need of antidiuretic hormone for its antidiuretic effect, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) All patients receiving Desmopressin Acetate Injection therapy should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. 3. Desmopressin Acetate Injection should not be used to treat patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease since platelet aggregation may be induced. 4. Desmopressin Acetate Injection should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia.",

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: For injection use only. Desmopressin Acetate Injection (desmopressin acetate) 4 mcg/mL has infrequently produced changes in blood pressure causing either a slight elevation in blood pressure or a transient fall in blood pressure and a compensatory increase in heart rate. The drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Desmopressin Acetate Injection (desmopressin acetate) should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders, because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. There have been rare reports of thrombotic events following Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL in patients predisposed to thrombus formation. No causality has been determined, however, the drug should be used with caution in these patients. Severe allergic reactions have been reported rarely. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal Desmopressin Acetate Injection, including isolated cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous Desmopressin Acetate Injection. It is not known whether antibodies to Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL are produced after repeated injections. Hemophilia A: Laboratory tests for assessing patient status include levels of factor VIII coagulant, factor VIII antigen and factor VIII ristocetin cofactor (von Willebrand factor) as well as activated partial thromboplastin time. Factor VIII coagulant activity should be determined before giving Desmopressin Acetate Injection for hemostasis. If factor VIII coagulant activity is present at less than 5% of normal, Desmopressin Acetate Injection should not be relied on. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease: Laboratory tests for assessing patient status include levels of factor VIII coagulant activity, factor VIII ristocetin cofactor activity, and factor VIII von Willebrand factor antigen. The skin bleeding time may be helpful in following these patients. Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, plasma osmolality may be required. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of Desmopressin Acetate Injection is very low compared with the antidiuretic activity, use of doses as large as 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection with other pressor agents should be done only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Desmopressin Acetate Injection has been used with epsilon aminocaproic acid without adverse effects. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Desmopressin Acetate Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to Desmopressin Acetate Injection. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications of desmopressin acetate\u2019s use in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmo- pressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year, Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable Desmopressin Acetate Injection in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 10 mcg. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Desmopressin Acetate Injection is admin- istered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL should not be used in infants less than three months of age in the treatment of hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease; safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus have not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min).

(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See WARNINGS .)"

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to Desmopressin Acetate Injection. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications of desmopressin acetate\u2019s use in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmo- pressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year, Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, Desmopressin Acetate Injection has produced transient headache, nausea, mild abdominal cramps and vulval pain. These symptoms disappeared with reduction in dosage. Occasionally, injection of Desmopressin Acetate Injection has produced local erythema, swelling or burning pain. Occasional facial flushing has been reported with the administration of Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Desmopressin Acetate Injection has infrequently produced changes in blood pressure causing either a slight elevation or a transient fall and a compensatory increase in heart rate. Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported rarely with Desmopressin Acetate Injection . See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia. Post Marketing: There have been rare reports of thrombotic events (acute cerebrovascular thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction) following Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients predisposed to thrombus formation, and rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.3 mcg Desmopressin Acetate Injection/kg body weight diluted in sterile physiological saline and infused slowly over 15 to 30 minutes. In adults and children weighing more than 10 kg, 50 mL of diluent is recommended; in children weighing 10 kg or less, 10 mL of diluent is recommended. Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored during infusion. If Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is used preoperatively, it should be administered 30 minutes prior to the scheduled procedure. The necessity for repeat administration of Desmopressin Acetate Injection or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. The tendency toward tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration given more frequently than every 48 hours should be considered in treating each patient. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) Diabetes Insipidus: This formulation is administered subcutaneously or by direct intravenous injection. Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. The usual dosage range in adults is 0.5 mL (2.0 mcg) to 1 mL (4.0 mcg) daily, administered intravenously or subcutaneously, usually in two divided doses. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. For patients who have been controlled on intranasal Desmopressin Acetate Injection and who must be switched to the injection form, either because of poor intranasal absorption or because of the need for surgery, the comparable antidiuretic dose of the injection is about one-tenth the intranasal dose. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics, CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use.) Directions for use of One Point Cut (OPC) Ampules for Desmopressin Acetate Injection: 1. Use aseptic technique to clean ampule. Gently tap the top of the ampule to assist the flow of the solution from the upper portion of the ampule to the lower portion. 2. Locate the blue dot on the upper portion of the ampule. Below this dot is a small score on the neck of the ampule. Hold the ampule with the blue dot facing away from you . 3. Cover the vial with an appropriate wipe. Apply pressure to the top and bottom portions of the ampule to snap the ampule open away from you."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intranasal use only ( 2.1 ) Instruct patients to prime pump prior to use ( 2.1 ) Adults : 10 mcg to 40 mcg daily (either as a single dose or divided into two or three daily doses) ( 2.2 ) Pediatrics: 10 mcg once daily into one nostril up to 30 mcg once daily (or 30 mcg divided as 20 mcg during the morning and 10 mcg at night) ( 2.2 ) See the Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for switching between desmopressin acetate formulations ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer desmopressin nasal spray by intranasal use only. Instruct patients about appropriate fluid restriction during desmopressin nasal spray treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Must prime the spray pump prior to the first use. Instruct patients to: Prime pump by pressing down on pump four times (if the spray pump is not used for one week, re-prime the pump by pressing down on the pump once). Discard desmopressin nasal spray after 50 sprays since the amount delivered thereafter may be substantially less than the recommended dosage. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The use of desmopressin nasal spray is not indicated for patients who require less than 10 mcg doses or doses that are not multiples of 10 mcg because the spray pump can only deliver doses of 10 mcg [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . If other doses are required, use another desmopressin acetate product. Individualize the dosage of desmopressin nasal spray for each patient with particular attention in pediatric and elderly patients and adjust according to the diurnal pattern of response to limit nocturia and to ensure fluid intake with respect to urine output is not excessive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Monitor continued response to desmopressin nasal spray by urine volume and osmolality to ensure adequate diuresis to limit the risk of hyponatremia, and include measurements of serum sodium and plasma osmolality as needed. Adults The recommended dosage in adults is 10 mcg once daily into one nostril up to 40 mcg once daily (or 40 mcg divided into two or three daily doses). If administered more than once a day, adjust for an adequate diurnal rhythm of urine output. Pediatric Patients For pediatric patients requiring doses less than 10 mcg, desmopressin nasal spray is not indicated. For pediatric patients 4 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage of desmopressin nasal spray is 10 mcg once daily into one nostril. The dose can be titrated up to 30 mcg once daily (or 30 mcg divided into two daily doses, typically with 20 mcg given in the morning and 10 mcg given at nighttime). If administered more than once a day, adjust for an adequate diurnal rhythm of urine output. Because administration of desmopressin acetate can be associated with decreased responsiveness with prolonged use, consider increasing the dosage of desmopressin nasal spray if patients demonstrate decreased response over a long period of time. 2.3 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations When switching from the desmopressin acetate injection to desmopressin nasal spray, administer 10 times the amount of desmopressin acetate, rounding down to the nearest 10 mcg. When switching from the desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin nasal spray individual dose titration is required because intranasal desmopressin is approximately 10 to 40 fold more potent than oral (tablet) desmopressin."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyponatremia: Instruct patients about proper fluid restriction and monitor serum sodium as needed ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Altered Absorption in Patients with Nasal Mucosa Abnormalities: May occur with chronic administration, and require use of other formulations instead ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Excessive fluid intake when urine output is limited by the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin may lead to water intoxication with hyponatremia. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported from postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Unless properly diagnosed and treated, hyponatremia can be fatal. All patients receiving desmopressin nasal spray should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness, and confusion. Severe symptoms due to an extreme decrease in serum sodium and plasma osmolality may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma, and/or respiratory arrest. In order to decrease the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, fluid restriction is recommended. Careful fluid intake restriction is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric patients because these patients are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] . More frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels is recommended in the following patients: those with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure, renal disorders, habitual or psychogenic polydipsia or those taking concomitant drugs that may cause hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Desmopressin nasal spray is not an indicated formulation for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis due to a higher risk of hyponatremia and hyponatremic convulsions with the use of the nasal spray formulation compared to desmopressin tablets seen in postmarketing reports [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. 5.2 Altered Absorption in Patients With Nasal Mucosa Abnormalities Chronic administration of desmopressin nasal spray may result in changes to nasal mucosa. Nasal mucosa abnormalities (such as scarring and edema) due to chronic administration, or due to other causes (nasal blockage, nasal mucosal atrophy, severe atrophic rhinitis, recent nasal surgery such as transsphenoidal hypophysectomy) may cause erratic, unreliable absorption. Avoid use of desmopressin nasal spray in such patients [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] and consider use of other formulations of desmopressin acetate given by other routes of administration."

In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of desmopressin during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses approximately <1 and 38 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desmopressin acetate at up to 50 ng/kg/day was given by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats, from gestation day 1 to 20 during the period of early embryonic development and organogenesis without teratogenic effects. Desmopressin acetate at up to 10 mcg/kg/day was given to pregnant rabbits by subcutaneous injection from gestation day 6 to 18 during fetal organogenesis without teratogenic effects. These doses of desmopressin acetate represent approximately <1 times (rat) and 38 times (rabbit) the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal intranasal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data). There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desmopressin nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A trial was conducted in six healthy lactating women, at greater than 4 months postpartum, to evaluate intranasal administration of 300 mcg single dose of another desmopressin product (7.5 times the recommended adult dose of desmopressin nasal spray). Samples of maternal plasma and breastmilk were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min after the drug administration. At 8 hours after dose intake, the levels in the milk ranged between 4.16 and 101 pg/ml, and the plasma levels ranged between 40 and 242 pg/ml. The total amount of desmopressin present in the milk over the 8 hours ranged between 491 pg and 16 ng, which corresponds to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the administered dose to the breastfeeding mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Desmopressin nasal spray is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older. Desmopressin nasal spray is not indicated in pediatric patients less than 4 years of age. Use of desmopressin nasal spray in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is supported by evidence from adults and pediatric patients with central diabetes insipidus. Use in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible water intoxication with hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at a low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. Because elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment, care should be taken in dose selection, and monitoring renal function is recommended [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Use of desmopressin nasal spray in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible water intoxication with hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.3 ), Contraindications ( 4 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The use of desmopressin nasal spray in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Desmopressin acetate is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Elimination: Desmopressin acetate exhibits a biphasic elimination profile, with half-lives of 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the initial and terminal phases, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate injection (this results in approximately 20 times the exposure of 10 mcg of desmopressin nasal spray). The terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, 4.0 hours in mild renal impairment, 6.6 hours in moderate renal impairment and 8.7 hours in severe renal impairment. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin exposure was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus: Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets are about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray and Desmopressin Acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) (SE) = Standard error of the mean With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) (SD) = Standard Deviation All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS 1. Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. 2. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. 3. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and Desmopressin Acetate Injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Category B: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus: The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablets therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration. ( 2 ) 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ]. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4) ]. If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4) ]. It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL contains as active substance, desmopressin acetate,USP, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. One mL (4 mcg) of desmopressin acetate solution has an antidiuretic activity of about 16 IU; 1 mcg of desmopressin acetate is equivalent to 4 IU. Desmopressin acetate has been shown to be more potent than arginine vasopressin in increasing plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. Dose-response studies were performed in healthy persons, using doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mcg/kg body weight, infused over a 10-minute period. Maximal dose response occurred at 0.3 to 0.4 mcg/kg. The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent of initial concentrations obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg body weight. The increase is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The factor VIII related antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were also increased to a smaller degree, but still are dose-dependent. The biphasic half-lives of desmopressin acetate were 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the fast and slow phases, respectively, compared with 2.5 and 14.5 minutes for lysine vasopressin, another form of the hormone. As a result, desmopressin acetate provides a prompt onset of antidiuretic action with a long duration after each administration. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate has resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. When administered by injection, desmopressin acetate has an antidiuretic effect about ten times that of an equivalent dose administered intranasally. The bioavailability of the subcutaneous route of administration was determined qualitatively using urine output data. The exact fraction of drug absorbed by that route of administration has not been quantitatively determined. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. Plasminogen activator activity increases rapidly after desmopressin acetate infusion, but there has been no clinically significant fibrinolysis in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. The effect of repeated desmopressin acetate administration when doses were given every 12 to 24 hours has generally shown a gradual diminution of the factor VIII activity increase noted with a single dose. The initial response is reproducible in any particular patient if there are 2 or 3 days between administrations. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hemophilia A: Desmopressin Acetate Injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated for patients with hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels greater than 5%. Desmopressin acetate injection will often maintain hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A during surgical procedures and postoperatively when administered 30 minutes prior to scheduled procedure. Desmopressin acetate injection will also stop bleeding in hemophilia A patients with episodes of spontaneous or trauma-induced injuries such as hemarthroses, intramuscular hematomas or mucosal bleeding. Desmopressin acetate injection is not indicated for the treatment of hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels equal to or less than 5%, or for the treatment of hemophilia B, or in patients who have factor VIII antibodies. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate injection in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated for patients with mild to moderate classic von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) with factor VIII levels greater than 5%. Desmopressin acetate injection will often maintain hemostasis in patients with mild to moderate von Willebrand\u2019s disease during surgical procedures and postoperatively when administered 30 minutes prior to the scheduled procedure. Desmopressin acetate injection will usually stop bleeding in mild to moderate von Willebrand\u2019s patients with episodes of spontaneous or trauma-induced injuries such as hemarthroses, intramuscular hematomas or mucosal bleeding. Those von Willebrand\u2019s disease patients who are least likely to respond are those with severe homozygous von Willebrand\u2019s disease with factor VIII coagulant activity and factor VIII von Willebrand factor antigen levels less than 1%. Other patients may respond in a variable fashion depending on the type of molecular defect they have. Bleeding time and factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand factor antigen should be checked during administration of desmopressin acetate injection to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. Desmopressin acetate injection is not indicated for the treatment of severe classic von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and when there is evidence of an abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. ( See WARNINGS . ) Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central (cranial) diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate injection is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin acetate is also available as an intranasal preparation. However, this means of delivery can be compromised by a variety of factors that can make nasal insufflation ineffective or inappropriate. These include poor intranasal absorption, nasal congestion and blockage, nasal discharge, atrophy of nasal mucosa, and severe atrophic rhinitis. Intranasal delivery may be inappropriate where there is an impaired level of consciousness. In addition, cranial surgical procedures, such as transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, create situations where an alternative route of administration is needed as in cases of nasal packing or recovery from surgery."

Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min). Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate injection is administered to patients who do not have need of antidiuretic hormone for its antidiuretic effect, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. ( See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate should not be used to treat patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease since platelet aggregation may be induced. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For injection use only. Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL has infrequently produced changes in blood pressure causing either a slight elevation in blood pressure or a transient fall in blood pressure and a compensatory increase in heart rate. The drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders, because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. There have been rare reports of thrombotic events following desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL in patients predisposed to thrombus formation. No causality has been determined, however, the drug should be used with caution in these patients. Severe allergic reactions have been reported rarely. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including isolated cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL are produced after repeated injections. Hemophilia A: Laboratory tests for assessing patient status include levels of factor VIII coagulant, factor VIII antigen and factor VIII ristocetin cofactor (von Willebrand factor) as well as activated partial thromboplastin time. Factor VIII coagulant activity should be determined before giving desmopressin acetate for hemostasis. If factor VIII coagulant activity is present at less than 5% of normal, desmopressin acetate should not be relied on. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease: Laboratory tests for assessing patient status include levels of factor VIII coagulant activity, factor VIII ristocetin cofactor activity, and factor VIII von Willebrand factor antigen. The skin bleeding time may be helpful in following these patients. Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, plasma osmolality may be required. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared with the antidiuretic activity, use of doses as large as 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate with other pressor agents should be done only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Desmopressin acetate has been used with epsilon aminocaproic acid without adverse effects. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications of desmopressin acetate\u2019s use in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year, Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 10 mcg. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. ( See WARNINGS .) Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL should not be used in infants less than three months of age in the treatment of hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease; safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min). ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. ( See WARNINGS .)"

If factor VIII coagulant activity is present at less than 5% of normal, desmopressin acetate should not be relied on. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease: Laboratory tests for assessing patient status include levels of factor VIII coagulant activity, factor VIII ristocetin cofactor activity, and factor VIII von Willebrand factor antigen. The skin bleeding time may be helpful in following these patients. Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, plasma osmolality may be required."

      "Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared with the antidiuretic activity, use of doses as large as 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate with other pressor agents should be done only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution.

      "Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications of desmopressin acetate\u2019s use in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year, Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min). ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .)

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL is administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.3 mcg desmopressin acetate/kg body weight diluted in sterile physiological saline and infused slowly over 15 to 30 minutes. In adults and children weighing more than 10 kg, 50 mL of diluent is recommended; in children weighing 10 kg or less, 10 mL of diluent is recommended. Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored during infusion. If desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL is used preoperatively, it should be administered 30 minutes prior to the scheduled procedure. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate injection or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. The tendency toward tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration given more frequently than every 48 hours should be considered in treating each patient. Fluid restriction should be observed. ( See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Diabetes Insipidus: This formulation is administered subcutaneously or by direct intravenous injection. Desmopressin acetate injection 4 mcg/mL dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. The usual dosage range in adults is 0.5 mL (2 mcg) to 1 mL (4 mcg) daily, administered intravenously or subcutaneously, usually in two divided doses. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. For patients who have been controlled on intranasal desmopressin acetate and who must be switched to the injection form, either because of poor intranasal absorption or because of the need for surgery, the comparable antidiuretic dose of the injection is about one-tenth the intranasal dose. Fluid restriction should be observed. ( See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Geriatric Use : This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate injection in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate injection or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate injection is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1 . Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.3. Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Other Drugs that may Increase Risk of Hyponatremia The concomitant administration of desmopressin acetate with other drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine, sulfonylureas, particularly chlorpropamide, oxybutynin and carbamazepine), requires more frequent serum sodium monitoring. Monitor serum sodium more frequently in patients taking desmopressin acetate concomitantly with these drugs and when doses of these drugs are increased [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. 7.2 Other Vasoconstrictors Desmopressin acetate can elevate blood pressure. Use of desmopressin acetate with other vasoconstrictors may require a reduction of the desmopressin acetate dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for desmopressin acetate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of desmopressin acetate in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate injection in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate injection or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate injection is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.3. Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for desmopressin acetate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of desmopressin acetate in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin Acetate Tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus: Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of Desmopressin Acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets , the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray and Desmopressin Acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets , no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving Desmopressin Acetate Tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SE) = Standard error of the mean 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SD) = Standard Deviation 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on Desmopressin Acetate Intranasal Spray , after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg Desmopressin Acetate Tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5-17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4-14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day Desmopressin Acetate Tablets, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4-14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS 1. Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. 2. When Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. 3. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and Desmopressin Acetate Injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets . Laboratory Tests: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Category B: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/ kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin Acetate Tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin Acetate Tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and Desmopressin Acetate Injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets ."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution."

Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/ kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus: The dosage of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of Desmopressin Acetate Tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4)] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.2)] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4)] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 )See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia.Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of Desmopressin Acetate Injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of Desmopressin Acetate Injection or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if Desmopressin Acetate Injection is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of Desmopressin Acetate Injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin Acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray to Desmopressin Acetate Injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray dose. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Tablets to Desmopressin Acetate Injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension: May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during Desmopressin Acetate Injection administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB: Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin Acetate Injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ]. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming Desmopressin Acetate Injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating Desmopressin Acetate Injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If hyponatremia occurs, Desmopressin Acetate Injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin Acetate Injection may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during Desmopressin Acetate Injection administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal Desmopressin Acetate Injection, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of Desmopressin Acetate Injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. It is not known whether antibodies to Desmopressin Acetate Injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin Acetate Injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention.Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with Desmopressin Acetate Injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk: Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data). There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Desmopressin Acetate Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Desmopressin Acetate Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001% to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to Desmopressin Acetate Injection of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection infused over 10 minutes. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies I n vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to Desmopressin Acetate Injection of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate Injection infused over 10 minutes. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate. Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SE) = Standard error of the mean 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SD) = Standard Deviation 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and intravenous desmopressin acetate have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m2) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min).

      "General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and intravenous desmopressin acetate have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets."

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus: Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray and Desmopressin Acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg.

At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. table-1 Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5-17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4-14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n=85) 0.2 mg/day (n=79) 0.4 mg/day (n=82) 0.6 mg/day (n=83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs. placebo \u2500 <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4-14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate tablets are ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate tablets may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS \u2022 Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. \u2022 When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. \u2022 Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and desmopressin acetate injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported rarely with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate, but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Category B: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate tablets. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See WARNINGS .)"

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate and desmopressin acetate injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. Central Diabetes Insipidus: In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The only adverse event occurring in \u2265 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo). Other: The following adverse events have been reported; however, their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain.

An intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg in mice demonstrated no effect."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus: The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablets therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) Adults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics, CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use.) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

      "BOXED WARNING WARNING: HYPONATREMIA Desmopressin acetate can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as patients with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and in those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Ensure the serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming desmopressin acetate. Measure serum sodium within 7 days and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy, and periodically during treatment. More frequently monitor serum sodium in patients 65 years of age and older and in patients at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . WARNING: HYPONATREMIA See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Desmopressin acetate can cause hyponatremia, which may be life threatening if severe.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Discard unused portion. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4)] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.2)] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4)] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intranasal use only ( 2.1 ) Instruct patients to prime pump prior to use ( 2.1 ) Adults: 10 mcg to 40 mcg daily (either as a single dose or divided into two or three daily doses) ( 2.2 ) Pediatrics: 10 mcg once daily into one nostril up to 30 mcg once daily (or 30 mcg divided as 20 mcg during the morning and 10 mcg at night) ( 2.2 ) See the Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for switching between desmopressin acetate formulations ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer desmopressin nasal spray solution by intranasal use only. Instruct patients about appropriate fluid restriction during desmopressin nasal spray solution treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Must prime the spray pump prior to the first use. Instruct patients to: Prime pump by pressing down on pump five times (if the spray pump is not used for one week, re-prime the pump by pressing down on the pump once). Discard desmopressin nasal spray solution after 50 sprays since the amount delivered thereafter may be substantially less than the recommended dosage. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The use of desmopressin nasal spray solution is not indicated for patients who require less than 10 mcg doses or doses that are not multiples of 10 mcg because the spray pump can only deliver doses of 10 mcg [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . If other doses are required, use another desmopressin acetate product. Individualize the dosage of desmopressin nasal spray solution for each patient with particular attention in pediatric and elderly patients and adjust according to the diurnal pattern of response to limit nocturia and to ensure fluid intake with respect to urine output is not excessive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor continued response to desmopressin nasal spray solution by urine volume and osmolality to ensure adequate diuresis to limit the risk of hyponatremia, and include measurements of serum sodium and plasma osmolality as needed. Adults The recommended dosage in adults is 10 mcg once daily into one nostril up to 40 mcg once daily (or 40 mcg divided into two or three daily doses). If administered more than once a day, adjust for an adequate diurnal rhythm of urine output. Pediatric Patients For pediatric patients requiring doses less than 10 mcg, desmopressin nasal spray solution is not indicated. For pediatric patients 4 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage of desmopressin nasal spray solution is 10 mcg once daily into one nostril. The dose can be titrated up to 30 mcg once daily (or 30 mcg divided into two daily doses, typically with 20 mcg given in the morning and 10 mcg given at nighttime). If administered more than once a day, adjust for an adequate diurnal rhythm of urine output. Because administration of desmopressin acetate can be associated with decreased responsiveness with prolonged use, consider increasing the dosage of desmopressin nasal spray solution if patients demonstrate decreased response over a long period of time. 2.3 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations When switching from the desmopressin acetate injection to desmopressin nasal spray solution, administer 10 times the amount of desmopressin acetate, rounding down to the nearest 10 mcg. When switching from the desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin nasal spray solution, individual dose titration is required because intranasal desmopressin is approximately 10 to 40 fold more potent than oral (tablet) desmopressin."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyponatremia: Instruct patients about proper fluid restriction and monitor serum sodium as needed ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Altered Absorption in Patients with Nasal Mucosa Abnormalities: May occur with chronic administration, and require use of other formulations instead ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Excessive fluid intake when urine output is limited by the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin may lead to water intoxication with hyponatremia. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported from postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Unless properly diagnosed and treated, hyponatremia can be fatal. All patients receiving desmopressin nasal spray solution should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness, and confusion. Severe symptoms due to an extreme decrease in serum sodium and plasma osmolality may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma, and/or respiratory arrest. In order to decrease the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, fluid restriction is recommended. Careful fluid intake restriction is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric patients because these patients are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ]. More frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels is recommended in the following patients: those with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure, renal disorders, habitual or psychogenic polydipsia or those taking concomitant drugs that may cause hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Desmopressin nasal spray solution is not an indicated formulation for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis due to a higher risk of hyponatremia and hyponatremic convulsions with the use of the nasal spray formulation compared to desmopressin tablets seen in postmarketing reports [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. 5.2 Altered Absorption in Patients with Nasal Mucosa Abnormalities Chronic administration of desmopressin nasal spray solution may result in changes to nasal mucosa. Nasal mucosa abnormalities (such as scarring and edema) due to chronic administration, or due to other causes (nasal blockage, nasal mucosal atrophy, severe atrophic rhinitis, recent nasal surgery such as transsphenoidal hypophysectomy) may cause erratic, unreliable absorption. Avoid use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in such patients [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] and consider use of other formulations of desmopressin acetate given by other routes of administration."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Use requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent hyponatremia with water intoxication ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Geriatric Use : Carefully monitor renal function; restrict fluid intake to prevent hyponatremia with water intoxication ( 5.1 , 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published data and case reports, did not identify a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of desmopressin during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses approximately <1 and 38 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desmopressin acetate at up to 50 ng/kg/day was given by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats, from gestation day 1 to 20 during the period of early embryonic development and organogenesis without teratogenic effects. Desmopressin acetate at up to 10 mcg/kg/day was given to pregnant rabbits by subcutaneous injection from gestation day 6 to 18 during fetal organogenesis without teratogenic effects. These doses of desmopressin acetate represent approximately <1 times (rat) and 38 times (rabbit) the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal intranasal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data). There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin nasal spray solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desmopressin nasal spray solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A trial was conducted in six healthy lactating women, at greater than 4 months postpartum, to evaluate intranasal administration of 300 mcg single dose of another desmopressin product (7.5 times the recommended adult dose of desmopressin nasal spray solution). Samples of maternal plasma and breastmilk were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min after the drug administration. At 8 hours after dose intake, the levels in the milk ranged between 4.16 and 101 pg/ml, and the plasma levels ranged between 40 and 242 pg/ml. The total amount of desmopressin present in the milk over the 8 hours ranged between 491 pg and 16 ng, which corresponds to 0.0001 - 0.005% of the administered dose to the breastfeeding mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Desmopressin nasal spray solution is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older. Desmopressin nasal spray solution is not indicated in pediatric patients less than 4 years of age. Use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is supported by evidence from adults and pediatric patients with central diabetes insipidus. Use in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible water intoxication with hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin nasal spray solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at a low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. Because elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment, care should be taken in dose selection, and monitoring renal function is recommended [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible water intoxication with hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin nasal spray solution is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.3 ), Contraindications (4) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Desmopressin acetate is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Elimination: Desmopressin acetate exhibits a biphasic elimination profile, with half-lives of 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the initial and terminal phases, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment : Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate injection (this results in approximately 20 times the exposure of 10 mcg of desmopressin nasal spray solution). The terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, 4.0 hours in mild renal impairment, 6.6 hours in moderate renal impairment and 8.7 hours in severe renal impairment. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin exposure was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]."

      "Instructions for Use Desmopressin Nasal Spray Solution, 10 mcg per 0.1 mL For Intranasal Use Only Read these instructions before using desmopressin nasal spray solution, and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Children should be helped by an adult when using desmopressin nasal spray solution, to make sure the right amount of medicine is used. The parts of your desmopressin nasal spray solution pump (see Figure A): Priming your desmopressin nasal spray solution: Your desmopressin nasal spray pump must be primed before you use it for the first time. Remove the protective cap (see Figure B). Press down on the shoulders at the top of your desmopressin nasal spray solution pump 5 times. Hold the spray nozzle tip away from your face and eyes (see Figure C). After your desmopressin nasal spray pump is primed, it will spray 10 micrograms (1 dose) of medicine each time it is pressed. Using your desmopressin nasal spray: Step 1. Remove the protective cap. Step 2. To make sure you get the right dose of medicine, hold bottle upright as shown in Figure D and place the spray nozzle tip of your desmopressin nasal spray solution into your nostril. Press the spray pump 1 time for 1 dose. If 2 doses are prescribed, spray each nostril 1 time. It is very important that you hold the bottle upright while giving the medicine. You may need to lean your head slightly forward to prevent tilting the bottle. Tilting the bottle, especially when less than half of the solution is left in the bottle, may cause the pump to not work the right way (see Figure E). Step 3. Put the spray nozzle tip of your desmopressin nasal spray solution into your nostril and press the spray pump 1 time for 1 dose (see Figure F). If 2 doses are prescribed, spray each nostril 1 time. Step 4. Put the protective cap back on the spray nozzle tip when you finish using your desmopressin nasal spray. Keeping track of your Nasal Sprays: Use the check-off chart to help you keep track of the number of sprays of desmopressin nasal spray solution used (see Figure G). Keep this chart with your desmopressin nasal spray solution or put it in a place where you can easily get it. Check off number 1 on the chart with your first dose of desmopressin nasal spray solution. Check off the numbers after each use of your desmopressin nasal spray solution. If your healthcare provider prescribed a dose of 2 sprays, then 2 numbers should be checked off. Your desmopressin nasal spray solution holds 50 sprays with the right amount of medicine in each spray. If any medicine is left in your desmopressin nasal spray solution after 50 sprays, do not use it. You may not get the right amount of medicine. Throw away your desmopressin nasal spray solution after 50 sprays. Do not count the priming sprays. Your desmopressin nasal spray solution has been filled with extra medicine for your priming sprays. Do not try to remove any medicine from your desmopressin nasal spray solution pump and place it in another bottle. How should I store desmopressin nasal spray solution? Store desmopressin nasal spray solution in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). When traveling, desmopressin nasal spray solution can be stored at room temperature up to 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) for up to 3 weeks. Store desmopressin nasal spray solution standing upright.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intranasal use only ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Instruct patients to prime pump prior to use ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adults: 10 mcg to 40 mcg daily (either as a single dose or divided into two or three daily doses) ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Pediatrics: 10 mcg once daily into one nostril up to 30 mcg once daily (or 30 mcg divided as 20 mcg during the morning and 10 mcg at night) ( 2.2 ) \u2022 See the Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for switching between desmopressin acetate formulations ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer desmopressin nasal spray solution by intranasal use only. Instruct patients about appropriate fluid restriction during desmopressin nasal spray solution treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Must prime the spray pump prior to the first use. Instruct patients to: \u2022 Prime pump by pressing down on pump five times (if the spray pump is not used for one week, re-prime the pump by pressing down on the pump once). \u2022 Discard desmopressin nasal spray solution after 50 sprays since the amount delivered thereafter may be substantially less than the recommended dosage. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The use of desmopressin nasal spray solution is not indicated for patients who require less than 10 mcg doses or doses that are not multiples of 10 mcg because the spray pump can only deliver doses of 10 mcg [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . If other doses are required, use another desmopressin acetate product. Individualize the dosage of desmopressin nasal spray solution for each patient with particular attention in pediatric and elderly patients and adjust according to the diurnal pattern of response to limit nocturia and to ensure fluid intake with respect to urine output is not excessive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor continued response to desmopressin nasal spray solution by urine volume and osmolality to ensure adequate diuresis to limit the risk of hyponatremia, and include measurements of serum sodium and plasma osmolality as needed. Adults The recommended dosage in adults is 10 mcg once daily into one nostril up to 40 mcg once daily (or 40 mcg divided into two or three daily doses). If administered more than once a day, adjust for an adequate diurnal rhythm of urine output. Pediatric Patients \u2022 For pediatric patients requiring doses less than 10 mcg, desmopressin nasal spray solution is not indicated. \u2022 For pediatric patients 4 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage of desmopressin nasal spray solution is 10 mcg once daily into one nostril. The dose can be titrated up to 30 mcg once daily (or 30 mcg divided into two daily doses, typically with 20 mcg given in the morning and 10 mcg given at nighttime). If administered more than once a day, adjust for an adequate diurnal rhythm of urine output. Because administration of desmopressin acetate can be associated with decreased responsiveness with prolonged use, consider increasing the dosage of desmopressin nasal spray solution if patients demonstrate decreased response over a long period of time. 2.3 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations When switching from the desmopressin acetate injection to desmopressin nasal spray solution, administer 10 times the amount of desmopressin acetate, rounding down to the nearest 10 mcg. When switching from the desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin nasal spray solution, individual dose titration is required because intranasal desmopressin is approximately 10 to 40 fold more potent than oral (tablet) desmopressin."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hyponatremia: Instruct patients about proper fluid restriction and monitor serum sodium as needed ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Altered Absorption in Patients with Nasal Mucosa Abnormalities: May occur with chronic administration, and require use of other formulations instead ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Excessive fluid intake when urine output is limited by the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin may lead to water intoxication with hyponatremia. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported from postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Unless properly diagnosed and treated, hyponatremia can be fatal. All patients receiving desmopressin nasal spray solution should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness, and confusion. Severe symptoms due to an extreme decrease in serum sodium and plasma osmolality may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma, and/or respiratory arrest. In order to decrease the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, fluid restriction is recommended. Careful fluid intake restriction is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric patients because these patients are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5) ]. More frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels is recommended in the following patients: those with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure, renal disorders, habitual or psychogenic polydipsia or those taking concomitant drugs that may cause hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Desmopressin nasal spray solution is not an indicated formulation for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis due to a higher risk of hyponatremia and hyponatremic convulsions with the use of the nasal spray formulation compared to desmopressin tablets seen in postmarketing reports [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. 5.2 Altered Absorption in Patients with Nasal Mucosa Abnormalities Chronic administration of desmopressin nasal spray solution may result in changes to nasal mucosa. Nasal mucosa abnormalities (such as scarring and edema) due to chronic administration, or due to other causes (nasal blockage, nasal mucosal atrophy, severe atrophic rhinitis, recent nasal surgery such as transsphenoidal hypophysectomy) may cause erratic, unreliable absorption. Avoid use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in such patients [see Indications and Usage (1) ] and consider use of other formulations of desmopressin acetate given by other routes of administration."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pediatric Use: Use requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent hyponatremia with water intoxication ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Geriatric Use : Carefully monitor renal function; restrict fluid intake to prevent hyponatremia with water intoxication ( 5.1 , 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published data and case reports, did not identify a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of desmopressin during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses approximately <1 and 38 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Desmopressin acetate at up to 50 ng/kg/day was given by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats, from gestation day 1 to 20 during the period of early embryonic development and organogenesis without teratogenic effects. Desmopressin acetate at up to 10 mcg/kg/day was given to pregnant rabbits by subcutaneous injection from gestation day 6 to 18 during fetal organogenesis without teratogenic effects. These doses of desmopressin acetate represent approximately <1 times (rat) and 38 times (rabbit) the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal intranasal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data). There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin nasal spray solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desmopressin nasal spray solution or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A trial was conducted in six healthy lactating women, at greater than 4 months postpartum, to evaluate intranasal administration of 300 mcg single dose of another desmopressin product (7.5 times the recommended adult dose of desmopressin nasal spray solution). Samples of maternal plasma and breastmilk were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min after the drug administration. At 8 hours after dose intake, the levels in the milk ranged between 4.16 and 101 pg/ml, and the plasma levels ranged between 40 and 242 pg/ml. The total amount of desmopressin present in the milk over the 8 hours ranged between 491 pg and 16 ng, which corresponds to 0.0001 - 0.005% of the administered dose to the breastfeeding mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Desmopressin nasal spray solution is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older. Desmopressin nasal spray solution is not indicated in pediatric patients less than 4 years of age. Use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is supported by evidence from adults and pediatric patients with central diabetes insipidus. Use in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible water intoxication with hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin nasal spray solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at a low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. Because elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment, care should be taken in dose selection, and monitoring renal function is recommended [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible water intoxication with hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin nasal spray solution is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.3 ), Contraindications (4) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The use of desmopressin nasal spray solution in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Desmopressin acetate is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Elimination: Desmopressin acetate exhibits a biphasic elimination profile, with half-lives of 7.8 and 75.5 minutes for the initial and terminal phases, respectively. Specific Populations Renal Impairment : Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate injection (this results in approximately 20 times the exposure of 10 mcg of desmopressin nasal spray solution). The terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, 4.0 hours in mild renal impairment, 6.6 hours in moderate renal impairment and 8.7 hours in severe renal impairment. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin exposure was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (desmopressin acetate Nasal Spray and desmopressin acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) (SE) = Standard error of the mean With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) (SD) = Standard Deviation All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients' diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis in Pediatrics Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5-17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4-14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10(0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ----- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4-14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half- life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS 1. Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. 2. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia (See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use ). All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. 3. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and desmopressin acetate injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, since these patients may develop hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients, the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian (See WARNINGS ). Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin acetate for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min) (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient (See WARNINGS )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, high doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate and desmopressin acetate injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. Central Diabetes Insipidus In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The only adverse event occurring in \u2265 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo). Other The following adverse events have been reported; however, their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain.

In case of overdose, the dose should be reduced, frequency of administration decreased, or the drug withdrawn according to the severity of the condition. There is no known specific antidote for desmopressin acetate. The patient should be observed and treated with appropriate symptomatic therapy. An oral LD 50 has not been established.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use ). Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u00b7 Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. (2.1) \u00b7 Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. (2.1) \u00b7 See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration (2). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension: May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. (5.2) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB: Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. (5.3) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. (5.4) Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. (5.5) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4)] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4)] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. (8.4) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretio n After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try Desmopressin Acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP [see Warning and Precaution (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5) ] . Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of Desmopressin Acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if Desmopressin Acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin Acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray to Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, the starting dose is one-tenth times the Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray dose. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Tablets to Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk: Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts ( see Data ). There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Desmopressin Acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of Desmopressin Acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin Acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin Acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to Desmopressin Acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try Desmopressin Acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP [see Warning and Precaution (5.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5) ] . Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of Desmopressin Acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if Desmopressin Acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin Acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray to Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, the starting dose is one-tenth times the Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray dose. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Tablets to Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4) ] . If hyponatremia occurs, Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin Acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during Desmopressin Acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.3. Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of Desmopressin Acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal Desmopressin Acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous Desmopressin Acetate. Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP [see Contraindications (4) ] . It is not known whether antibodies to Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] ."

( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk: Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts ( see Data ). There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Desmopressin Acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of Desmopressin Acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin Acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin Acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to Desmopressin Acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin Acetate Tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus: Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of Desmopressin Acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets , the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray and Desmopressin Acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets , no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving Desmopressin Acetate Tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SE) = Standard error of the mean 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SD) = Standard Deviation 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on Desmopressin Acetate Intranasal Spray , after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg Desmopressin Acetate Tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5-17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4-14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day Desmopressin Acetate Tablets, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4-14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Human Pharmacokinetics: Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin Acetate Tablets may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets . Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS 1. Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. 2. When Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. 3. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and Desmopressin Acetate Injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets . Laboratory Tests: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Category B: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/ kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin Acetate Tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin Acetate Tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus: The dosage of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of Desmopressin Acetate Tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The dosage of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin acetate administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate. Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SE) = Standard error of the mean 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SD) = Standard Deviation 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and intravenous desmopressin acetate have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m2) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication.

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See WARNINGS .)"

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate tablets and injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. Central Diabetes Insipidus In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The only adverse event occurring in \u22653% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo). Other The following adverse events have been reported; however their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain. See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINCAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diabetes Insipidus: The daily dose is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. ( 2.1 ) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration ( 2 ). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try Desmopressin Acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Diabetes Insipidus Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses. Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of Desmopressin Acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if Desmopressin Acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1 . Dilute Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin Acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray to Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP, the starting dose is one-tenth times the Desmopressin Acetate Nasal Spray dose. When switching from Desmopressin Acetate Tablets to Desmopressin Acetate Injection, USP, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during Desmopressin Acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB : Use of Desmopressin Acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin Acetate Injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning ] . Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming Desmopressin Acetate Injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating Desmopressin Acetate Injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If hyponatremia occurs, Desmopressin Acetate Injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin Acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during Desmopressin Acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB Use of Desmopressin Acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal Desmopressin Acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous Desmopressin Acetate. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of Desmopressin Acetate Injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . It is not known whether antibodies to Desmopressin Acetate Injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin Acetate Injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin Acetate Injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with Desmopressin Acetate Injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data ) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Desmopressin Acetate Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Desmopressin Acetate Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001 to 0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Desmopressin Acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of Desmopressin Acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Desmopressin Acetate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin Acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin Acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to Desmopressin Acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8 to 12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of Desmopressin Acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with Desmopressin Acetate Injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function."

In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand\u2019s disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Diabetes Insipidus: Treatment na\u00efve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10 th the daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I): The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient. Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days. 2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s Disease (Type I) Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Discard unused portion. The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use. Table 1: Volume of Diluent Required Patient Weight Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for dilution 10 kg or less 10 mL More than 10 kg 50 mL Monitor blood pressure and pulse during infusion. 2.4 Switching Between Desmopressin Acetate Formulations Desmopressin acetate is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms. When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient. When switching from desmopressin acetate nasal spray to desmopressin acetate injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the desmopressin acetate nasal spray dose. When switching from desmopressin acetate tablets to desmopressin acetate injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension and Hypertension : May cause hypotension with compensatory increase in heart rate or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, especially in patients with heart disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB : Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may cause thrombosis due to platelet aggregation. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Severe reactions have occurred. Monitor for reactions during administration and interrupt if reaction occurs. ( 5.4 ) Fluid Retention : Fluid retention can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or with a history of urinary retention. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyponatremia Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning] . Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient\u2019s risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4)] . If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. 5.2 Hypotension and Hypertension Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.2)] 5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand\u2019s Disease Type IIB Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand\u2019s disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4)] . It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use: Initiate fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: Carefully select dose and monitor renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with desmopressin acetate injection in pregnant women over several decades, based on the available published literature and case reports, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies with human placenta demonstrate poor placental transfer of desmopressin. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproductive and developmental studies following administration of desmopressin acetate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits, at doses 130- and 110- times, respectively, the recommended dose of 18 mcg for a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease Associated Maternal and Embryo-fetal Risk : Pregnant women with Hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses and hemorrhagic events at delivery. An affected newborn may also be at risk of bleeding diatheses. Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study in rats, desmopressin acetate was administered intravenously at doses of 9.68, 48.4, or 241 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (gestations days 7 to 17). Laparohysterectomy for fetal examinations were conducted on gestation day 20 for twenty females in each group; the remaining 10 females were allowed to litter in order to determine any postnatal effects that might be attributable to pre-natal treatment. No effects were seen on maternal and fetal survival, growth and morphology or post-natal offspring survival, growth, development, behavior and reproductive performance up to 241 mcg/kg/day (130 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area). In an embryo-fetal development study and a pre- and postnatal development study in rabbits, desmopressin acetate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 2, 20 or 200 mcg/kg/day (embryo-fetal development) and 0.1, 1 or 10 mcg/kg/day (pre- and postnatal development) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18). No effects on maternal and fetal survival or morphology were observed in both studies at doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (215x the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient based on body surface area) nor were there effects in the pre- and postnatal development study on parturition, postnatal survival, growth, development or behavior, up to the highest dose tested of 10 mcg/kg/day (11 times the 18 mcg dose received by a 60 kg patient, based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfeeding is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of the infant to desmopressin following maternal administration. Desmopressin is poorly transferred into human breastmilk at negligible amounts (see Data) . There is no information on the effects of desmopressin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for desmopressin acetate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from desmopressin acetate injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Data The breast milk of lactating women was collected over 8 hours following administration of 300 mcg desmopressin nasal spray. The expected area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of desmopressin following 300 mcg nasal spray is 2.4-fold higher to that of 4 mcg Desmopressin acetate injection. Based on the measured concentrations of desmopressin following intranasal administration, the amounts of desmopressin that may be transferred to a breastfed infant correspond to 0.0001-0.005% of the dose administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with diabetes insipidus. The safety and effectiveness of desmopressin acetate have not been established in infants less than 3 months of age with hemophilia A or von Willebrand\u2019s disease or pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of desmopressin acetate injection in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Desmopressin acetate is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with renal impairment than patients with normal renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with estimated CLcr by Cockcroft-Gault equation less than 50 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Desmopressin acetate increases plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand\u2019s disease Type I. The antidiuretic effects of desmopressin acetate are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin acetate is a replacement hormone for antidiuretic hormone in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in increased duration of action and a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses were usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The response to desmopressin acetate of factor VIII activity and plasminogen activator is dose-related, with maximal plasma levels of 300 to 400 percent change from baseline obtained after infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg. The increase of factor VIII is rapid and evident within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum at a point ranging from 90 minutes to two hours. The duration of the hemostatic effect depends on the half-life for VIII:C which is about 8-12 hours. The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life is 2.8 hours. Metabolism Desmopressin is not metabolized by human CYP450 system. Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

The percentage increase of factor VIII levels in patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease was not significantly different from that observed in normal healthy individuals when treated with 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin acetate infused over 10 minutes. The use of desmopressin acetate injection in patients with central diabetes insipidus reduces urinary output, increases urine osmolality, and decreases plasma osmolality."

Excretion After intravenous administration of 2 mcg, 52% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged desmopressin. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsome preparations have shown that desmopressin does not inhibit the human CYP450 system. No in vivo interaction studies have been performed with desmopressin acetate injection. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects each group) with a single 2 mcg dose of desmopressin acetate intravenous injection. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 2.8 hours in subjects with normal renal function, and 4, 6.6, and 8.7 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, mean desmopressin area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 1.5 fold, 2.4 fold and 3.6 fold higher, respectively compared to that of subjects with normal renal function ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate. Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SE) = Standard error of the mean 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg (SD) = Standard Deviation 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and intravenous desmopressin acetate have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m2) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See WARNINGS .)"

      "General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and intravenous desmopressin acetate have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets."

Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m2) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case."

      "Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See WARNINGS .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (desmopressin acetate nasal spray and desmopressin acetate rhinal tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8 hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: (SE) = Standard error of the mean Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12 hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. (SD) = Standard Deviation Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was > 500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients' diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5 to 17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4 to 14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ---- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4 to 14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u2264 2 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose.The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n = 24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half-life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use ). All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and desmopressin acetate injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders because these patients are prone to hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Test Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian (see WARNINGS ). Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS ).

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use ). Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ). Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (desmopressin acetate Nasal Spray and desmopressin acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) (SE) = Standard error of the mean With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients Treatment Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.01 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.02 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.2 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.4 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) (SD) = Standard Deviation All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients' diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis in Pediatrics Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5-17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4-14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n = 85) 0.2 mg/day (n = 79) 0.4 mg/day (n = 82) 0.6 mg/day (n = 83) Baseline 10(0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10 (0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs placebo ----- <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4-14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response. Human Pharmacokinetics Desmopressin acetate is mainly excreted in the urine. A pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (n=24, 6 subjects in each group) receiving single dose desmopressin acetate (2 mcg) injection demonstrated a difference in desmopressin acetate terminal half- life. Terminal half-life significantly increased from 3 hours in normal healthy patients to 9 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to desmopressin acetate can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin acetate may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic intervention."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Desmopressin acetate tablets are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate tablets. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min). Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS 1. Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. 2. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia (See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use ). All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. 3. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and desmopressin acetate injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, since these patients may develop hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests Central Diabetes Insipidus Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Category B Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients, the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian (See WARNINGS ). Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results. Treatment with desmopressin acetate for primary nocturnal enuresis should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illness characterized by fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., systemic infections, fever, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea) or under conditions of extremely hot weather, vigorous exercise or other conditions associated with increased water intake. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desmopressin acetate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min) (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Use of desmopressin acetate tablets in geriatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient (See WARNINGS )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, high doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate and desmopressin acetate injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. Central Diabetes Insipidus In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central Diabetes Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use ). Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response. Fluid restriction should be observed, and fluid intake should be limited to a minimum from 1 hour before desmopressin administration, until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after administration.
