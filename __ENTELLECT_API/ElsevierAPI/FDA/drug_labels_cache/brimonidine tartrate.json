      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate ( see Contraindications 4.1 ) . Additionally, ophthalmic beta blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued (see Contraindications 4 .2 ) . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated ( see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of T hyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure ( see Contraindications, 4.4 ) . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface ( see Patient Counseling Information, 17 ) . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives /Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine O xidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years ( see Contraindications, 4.3 ) . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine.

The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.",

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30% to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30% to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites.

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of Brimonidine Tartrate/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical studies were conducted to compare the IOP-lowering effect over the course of the day of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered twice a day (BID) to individually-administered brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% administered three times per day (TID) and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5% BID in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1 to 2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1)] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4)] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of betaadrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and calcium antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications (4.3)] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized-by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. S pecial Populations Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

      "5 Warnings and Precautions Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )]. 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution . 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4) ]. 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

      "7 Drug Interactions Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. ( 7.3 ) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. ( 7.5 ) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. ( 7.6 ) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.7 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.8 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 Use in Specific Populations Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 \u2013 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50%-83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness.

      "12 Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution . Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

      "13 Nonclinical Toxicology 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution ."

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1-2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID.

Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10 to 30% of the subjects (in descending order): oral dryness, ocular hyperemia, burning and stinging, headache, blurring, foreign body sensation, fatigue/drowsiness, conjunctival follicles, ocular allergic reactions, and ocular pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 3 to 9% of the subjects (in descending order): corneal staining/erosion, photophobia, eyelid erythema, ocular ache/pain, ocular dryness, tearing, upper respiratory symptoms, eyelid edema, conjunctival edema, dizziness, blepharitis, ocular irritation, gastrointestinal symptoms, asthenia, conjunctival blanching, abnormal vision and muscular pain. Adverse reactions reported < 3% of the patients: lid crusting, conjunctival hemorrhage, abnormal taste, insomnia, conjunctival discharge, depression, hypertension, anxiety, palpitations/arrhythmias, nasal dryness and syncope. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: \u2022 Bradycardia; conjunctivitis; hypersensitivity; hypotension; iritis; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; lacrimation increased; miosis; nausea; skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation); and tachycardia. \u2022 Apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensive/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 375-fold higher or 19-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.2%, one drop in one eye, twice daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [ see Contraindications ( 4.1 )]. During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50 to 83% in patients ages 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age (greater than 20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 8.6 Special Population Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of a 0.2% solution, plasma concentrations peaked within 1 to 4 hours and declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. Distribution The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine."

Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. In comparative clinical studies with timolol 0.5%, lasting up to one year, the IOP lowering effect of Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% was approximately 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with approximately 6 mm Hg for timolol. In these studies, both patient groups were dosed BID; however, due to the duration of action of Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%, it is recommended that Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% be dosed TID. Eight percent of subjects were discontinued from studies due to inadequately controlled intraocular pressure, which in 30% of these patients occurred during the first month of therapy.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [ see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [ see Contraindications (4.2) ] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [ see Contraindications (4.4) ]. 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta- adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.",
      "5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [ see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension.",
      "5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [ see Contraindications (4.2) ] .",
      "5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution.",
      "5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans.",
      "5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.",
      "5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.",
      "5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.",
      "5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.",

( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [ see Contraindications (4.3) ] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized-by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1-2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia. Apnea, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions."

( 7.2 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.3 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15%, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. In animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent (see Data) . Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data Human Data Limited available data from postmarketing safety reports and published literature with topical use of brimonidine ophthalmic solution in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of pregnancy-related adverse outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, and events experienced by offspring while breastfeeding. Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Brimonidine caused miscarriage at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 70- or 50-times the recommended human ophthalmic dose [RHOD] based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.1% and 0.15%). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 9- and 6-fold the RHOD based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.1% and 0.15%). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rabbits. Signs of maternal sedation and fatigue were observed at all dose levels; the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day, based on the dose response for these signs. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100- and 750-fold the RHOD based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.1% and 0.15%). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rats. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day, based on signs of sedation and fatigue. The maternal NOAEL was 1.0 mg/kg/day (250- and 180-fold the RHOD based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.1% and 0.15%). After pregnant rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine and metabolites crossed the placenta and were detectable in fetal blood and organs. 8. 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and is excreted into breast milk after oral administration to lactating rats ( see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including central nervous system depression and apnea, from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% in nursing infants, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% is not recommended for use during lactation. Data Animal Data After a single oral dose of 14 C-labeled brimonidine tartrate to lactating rats, brimonidine and metabolites were detected in milk. After male and female rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine crossed the blood-brain barrier. Radiolabel was detected in the cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% is contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than 2 years old [ see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients aged 2 to 7 years old, the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50% to 83% in pediatric patients aged 2 to 6 years old) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients aged 7 years and older (greater than 20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of pediatric patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of either a 0.1% or 0.2% solution, plasma concentrations peaked within 0.5 to 2.5 hours and declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 2 hours. Distribution Brimonidine was approximately 29% bound to plasma proteins in healthy subjects. Elimination Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine."

Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1% to 4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postapproval use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia. Apnea, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. ( 7.1 ) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. ( 7.2 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.3 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. In animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent (see Data). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data Human Data Limited available data from postmarketing safety reports and published literature with topical use of brimonidine ophthalmic solution in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of pregnancy-related adverse outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, and events experienced by offspring while breastfeeding. Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Brimonidine caused miscarriage at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 70-or 50-times the recommended human ophthalmic dose [RHOD] based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.15%). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 9-and 6-fold the RHOD based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.15%). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rabbits. Signs of maternal sedation and fatigue were observed at all dose levels; the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day, based on the dose response for these signs. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,100-and 750-fold the RHOD based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.15%). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rats. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day, based on signs of sedation and fatigue. The maternal NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day (250-and 180-fold the RHOD based on AUC, respectively for brimonidine tartrate 0.15%). After pregnant rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine and metabolites crossed the placenta and were detectable in fetal blood and organs. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and is excreted into breast milk after oral administration to lactating rats (see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including central nervous system depression and apnea, from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is not recommended for use during lactation. Data Animal Data After a single oral dose of 14 C-labeled brimonidine tartrate to lactating rats, brimonidine and metabolites were detected in milk. After male and female rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine crossed the blood-brain barrier. Radiolabel was detected in the cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than 2 years old [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients aged 2 to 7 years old, the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50% to 83% in pediatric patients aged 2 to 6 years old) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients aged 7 years and older (greater than 20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of pediatric patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of either a 0.1% or 0.2% solution, plasma concentrations peaked within 0.5 to 2.5 hours and declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 2 hours. Distribution Brimonidine was approximately 29% bound to plasma proteins in healthy subjects. Elimination Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine."

Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications ( 4.4 )] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30% to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1 to 2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

      "5 Warnings and Precautions Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )]. 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution . 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4) ]. 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 Use in Specific Populations Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 \u2013 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50%-83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution . Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution ."

( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 375-fold higher or 19-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2%, one drop in one eye, twice daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [ see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) ]. During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50 to 83% in patients ages 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age (greater than 20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 8.6 Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known."

Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of a 0.2% solution, plasma concentrations peaked within 1 to 4 hours and declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. Distribution The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. In comparative clinical studies with timolol 0.5%, lasting up to one year, the IOP lowering effect of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution was approximately 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with approximately 6 mm Hg for timolol. In these studies, both patient groups were dosed BID; however, due to the duration of action of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, it is recommended that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution be dosed TID. Eight percent of subjects were discontinued from studies due to inadequately controlled intraocular pressure, which in 30% of these patients occurred during the first month of therapy. Approximately 20% were discontinued due to adverse experiences."

Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10-30% of the subjects (in descending order): oral dryness, ocular hyperemia, burning and stinging, headache, blurring, foreign body sensation, fatigue/drowsiness, conjunctival follicles, ocular allergic reactions, and ocular pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 3-9% of the subjects (in descending order): corneal staining/erosion, photophobia, eyelid erythema, ocular ache/pain, ocular dryness, tearing, upper respiratory symptoms, eyelid edema, conjunctival edema, dizziness, blepharitis, ocular irritation, gastrointestinal symptoms, asthenia, conjunctival blanching, abnormal vision and muscular pain. Adverse reactions reported <3% of the patients: lid crusting, conjunctival hemorrhage, abnormal taste, insomnia, conjunctival discharge, depression, hypertension, anxiety, palpitations/arrhythmias, nasal dryness and syncope. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: Bradycardia; conjunctivitis; hypersensitivity; hypotension; iritis; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; lacrimation increased; miosis; nausea; skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation); and tachycardia.

Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 375-fold higher or 19-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2%, one drop in one eye, twice daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine.

Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. In comparative clinical studies with timolol 0.5%, lasting up to one year, the IOP lowering effect of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution was approximately 4-6 mm Hg compared with approximately 6 mm Hg for timolol. In these studies, both patient groups were dosed BID; however, due to the duration of action of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, it is recommended that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution be dosed TID. Eight percent of subjects were discontinued from studies due to inadequately controlled intraocular pressure, which in 30% of these patients occurred during the first month of therapy. Approximately 20% were discontinued due to adverse experiences."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potenti a l for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications ( 4.4 )] . 5. 10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.1 1 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical studies were conducted to compare the IOP-lowering effect over the course of the day of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered twice a day (BID) to individually-administered brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% administered three times per day (TID) and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5% BID in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1-2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. ( 7.3 ) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. ( 7.5 ) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. ( 7.6 ) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.7 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.8 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 \u2013 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50%-83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10-20% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5-9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1-4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia.

The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5.0 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 360- and 20-fold higher, or 260- and 15-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% or 0.15%, 1 drop in both eyes three times daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , 4.1). During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10-20% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5-9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1-4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia.

( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5.0 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 360- and 20-fold higher, or 260- and 15-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.15%,1 drop in both eyes three times daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies,brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , 4.1). During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50-83% in patients ages 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 8.6 Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions (5.1) \u2022 Cardiac Failure (5.2) \u2022 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (5.3) \u2022 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency (5.4) \u2022 Increased Reactivity to Allergens (5.5) \u2022 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness (5.6) \u2022 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (5.7) \u2022 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis (5.8) \u2022 Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )]. 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications ( 4.4 )] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

(7.2) \u2022 Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. (7.3) \u2022 Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. (7.4) \u2022 Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. (7.5) \u2022 Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. (7.6) \u2022 CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.7) \u2022 Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. (7.8) \u2022 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. (7.9) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u22652 years of age. (8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30 to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5% in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.2%/0.5%."

Caution in using drugs such as beta-blockers (ophthalmic and systemic), anti-hypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15%, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% in humans can lead to resulting interference with its IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older ( 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. In animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent (see Data). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data Human Data Limited available data from postmarketing safety reports and published literature with topical use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of pregnancy-related adverse outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, and events experiences by offspring while breastfeeding. Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Brimonidine caused miscarriage at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 50-times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on AUC). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 6-fold the RHOD based on AUC). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rabbits. Signs of maternal sedation and fatigue were observed at all dose levels; the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day, based on the dose-response for these signs. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 750-fold the RHOD based on AUC). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rats. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day, based on signs of sedation and fatigue. The maternal NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day (180-fold the RHOD based on AUC). After pregnant rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine and metabolites crossed the placenta and were detectable in fetal blood and organs. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, brimonidine has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and is excreted into breast milk after oral administration to lactating rats (see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including central nervous system depression and apnea, from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% in nursing infants, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% is not recommended for use during lactation. Data Animal Data After a single oral dose of 14 C-labeled brimonidine tartrate to lactating rats, brimonidine and metabolites were detected in milk. After male and female rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine crossed the blood:brain barrier. Radiolabel was detected in the cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% is contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than 2 years old [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients aged 2 to 7 years old, the most commonly observed adverse events with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three-times-daily were somnolence (50% to 83% in pediatric patients aged 2 to 6 years old) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients aged 7 years and older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of pediatric patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing. Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a pharmacokinetic study, 14 healthy subjects (4 males and 10 females) received a single topical ocular administration of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15%, one drop per eye. The peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC 0-inf were 73 \u00b1 19 pg/mL and 375 \u00b1 89 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively. T max was 1.7 \u00b1 0.7 hours after dosing. The systemic half-life was approximately 2.1 hours. Distribution Brimonidine was approximately 29% bound to plasma proteins in healthy subjects. Elimination Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2) ] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) ] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4) ] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta\u00ad adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. ( 7.3 ) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. ( 7.5 ) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. ( 7.6 ) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.7 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.8 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications (4.3) ] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2219hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2219hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2,919 \u00b1 1,679 pg\u2219hr/mL versus 2,909 \u00b1 1,231 pg\u2219hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30% to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1 to 2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1)] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4)] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of betaadrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

( 7.8 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications (4.3)] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following bimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized-by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. S pecial Populations Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5% to 20% of patients receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1%-0.2%) included allergic conjunctivitis, burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pruritus, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Somerset Therapeutics, LLC at 1-800-417-9175 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10-20% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5-9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1-4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia.

(7.2) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. (7.3) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. (7.4) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5.0 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 360- and 20-fold higher, or 260- and 15-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% or brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.15%, 1 drop in both eyes three times daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , 4.1). During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50-83% in patients ages 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 8.6 Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4 .2 )] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )]) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications ( 4.4 )] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and calcium antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine.

The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 to 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50% to 83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30 to 40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1 to 2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 375-fold higher or 19-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2%, one drop in one eye, twice daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )] . During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50-83% in patients ages 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age (greater than 20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%).

Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. In comparative clinical studies with timolol 0.5%, lasting up to one year, the IOP lowering effect of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution was approximately 4-6 mm Hg compared with approximately 6 mm Hg for timolol. In these studies, both patient groups were dosed BID; however, due to the duration of action of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, it is recommended that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution be dosed TID. Eight percent of subjects were discontinued from studies due to inadequately controlled intraocular pressure, which in 30% of these patients occurred during the first month of therapy.

In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1.0 mg/kg/day in rats achieved ~77 and 118 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration estimated in humans treated with one drop brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% into both eyes 2 times per day. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. A reproduction and fertility study in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 1 mg/kg, estimated as approximately 200 times the systemic exposure (AUC) following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.5%."

In these studies, both patient groups were dosed BID; however, due to the duration of action of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, it is recommended that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution be dosed TID. Eight percent of subjects were discontinued from studies due to inadequately controlled intraocular pressure, which in 30% of these patients occurred during the first month of therapy.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10% to 20% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5% to 9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1% to 4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postapproval use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. In animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent (see Data). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data Human Data Limited available data from postmarketing safety reports and published literature with topical use of brimonidine ophthalmic solution in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of pregnancy-related adverse outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, and events experienced by offspring while breastfeeding. Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Brimonidine caused miscarriage at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 70-times the recommended human ophthalmic dose [RHOD] based on AUC, for brimonidine tartrate 0.1%). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 9-fold the RHOD based on AUC, for brimonidine tartrate 0.1%). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rabbits. Signs of maternal sedation and fatigue were observed at all dose levels; the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day, based on the dose response for these signs. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered brimonidine tartrate by daily oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 1100-fold the RHOD based on AUC, for brimonidine tartrate 0.1%). No treatment-related malformations were observed in rats. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity was 2.5 mg/kg/day, based on signs of sedation and fatigue. The maternal NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day (250-fold the RHOD based on AUC, for brimonidine tartrate 0.1%). After pregnant rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine and metabolites crossed the placenta and were detectable in fetal blood and organs. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and is excreted into breast milk after oral administration to lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including central nervous system depression and apnea, from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is not recommended for use during lactation. Data Animal Data After a single oral dose of 14 C-labeled brimonidine tartrate to lactating rats, brimonidine and metabolites were detected in milk. After male and female rats received a single oral dose of 14 C-brimonidine tartrate, brimonidine crossed the blood-brain barrier. Radiolabel was detected in the cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than 2 years old [see Contraindications ( 4.1 )]. During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients aged 2 to 7 years old, the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50% to 83% in pediatric patients aged 2 to 6 years old) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients aged 7 years and older (greater than 20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of pediatric patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10-20% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5-9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1-4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1-0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia.

( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5.0 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 360- and 20-fold higher, or 260- and 15-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.15%,1 drop in both eyes three times daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies,brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , 4.1). During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. In a well-controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% dosed three times daily were somnolence (50-83% in patients ages 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 8.6 Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of either a 0.1% or 0.2% solution, plasma concentrations peaked within 0.5 to 2.5 hours and declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 2 hours. Distribution The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions (5.1) Cardiac Failure (5.2) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (5.3) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency (5.4) Increased Reactivity to Allergens (5.5) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness (5.6) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (5.7) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis (5.8) Ocular Hype sensitivity (5.9) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1)] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta- blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4)] . 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta- adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. (7.1) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.2) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. (7.3) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. (7.4) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. (7.5) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. (7.6) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.7) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. (7.8) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. (7.9) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

(8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [see Contraindications (4.3)] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 \u2013 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well- controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta- adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration- time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean Cmax values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean Cmax of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution , brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration- time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean Cmax values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean Cmax of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility With brimonidine tartrate, no compound-related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21-month and 24-month study, respectively. In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma Cmax drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1-2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions ( 5.1 ) Cardiac Failure ( 5.2 ) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( 5.3 ) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency ( 5.4 ) Increased Reactivity to Allergens ( 5.5 ) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness ( 5.6 ) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ( 5.7 ) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis ( 5.8 ) Ocular Hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [ see Contraindications (4.1) ] . Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued [ see Contraindications (4.2) ] . 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] ) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [ see Contraindications (4.4) ]. 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta- adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.2 ) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. ( 7.3 ) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. ( 7.5 ) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. ( 7.6 ) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. ( 7.7 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.8 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.9 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta- adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Not for use in children below the age of 2 years. Use with caution in children \u2265 2 years of age. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals. Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 580 and 37-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day [4,200 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)] demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (83,000 times the MRHOD) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses 8,300 times the MRHOD without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Timolol has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [ see Contraindications (4.3) ] . During post-marketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established in the age groups 2 \u2013 16 years of age. Use of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in adults with additional data from a study of the concomitant use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in pediatric glaucoma patients (ages 2 to 7 years). In this study, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was dosed three times a day as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were somnolence (50%-83% in patients 2 to 6 years) and decreased alertness. In pediatric patients 7 years of age or older (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: brimonidine tartrate and timolol. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Both brimonidine and timolol have a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen at two hours post-dosing for brimonidine and one to two hours for timolol. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol maleate is a beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of brimonidine and timolol was assessed in healthy volunteers and patients following topical dosing with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Normal volunteers dosed with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily in both eyes for seven days showed peak plasma brimonidine and timolol concentrations of 30 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations of brimonidine peaked at 1 to 4 hours after ocular dosing. Peak plasma concentrations of timolol occurred approximately 1 to 3 hours post-dose. In a crossover study of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and timolol 0.5% administered twice daily for 7 days in healthy volunteers, the mean brimonidine area-under-the-plasma-concentration-time curve (AUC) for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was 128 \u00b1 61 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 141 \u00b1 106 pg\u2022hr/mL for the respective monotherapy treatments; mean C max values of brimonidine were comparable following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy (32.7 \u00b1 15 pg/mL versus 34.7 \u00b1 22.6 pg/mL, respectively). Mean timolol AUC for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was similar to that of the respective monotherapy treatment (2919 \u00b1 1679 pg\u2022hr/mL versus 2909 \u00b1 1231 pg\u2022hr/mL, respectively); mean C max of timolol was approximately 20% lower following brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution treatment versus monotherapy. In a parallel study in patients dosed twice daily with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, twice daily with timolol 0.5%, or three times daily with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, one-hour post dose plasma concentrations of timolol and brimonidine were approximately 30-40% lower with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution than their respective monotherapy values. The lower plasma brimonidine concentrations with brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution appears to be due to twice-daily dosing for brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution versus three-times dosing with brimonidine tartrate 0.2%. Distribution The protein binding of timolol is approximately 60%. The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. Metabolism In humans, brimonidine is extensively metabolized-by the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized by the liver. Excretion In the crossover study in healthy volunteers, the plasma concentration of brimonidine declined with a systemic half-life of approximately 3 hours. The apparent systemic half-life of timolol was about 7 hours after ocular administration. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. Approximately 87% of an orally-administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours, with 74% found in the urine. Unchanged timolol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney. Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol was not readily removed by dialysis. The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known. Following oral administration of timolol maleate, the plasma half-life of timolol is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency."

In these studies, dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 mg/kg/day in rats achieved 150 and 210 times, respectively, the plasma C max drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution into both eyes twice daily, the recommended daily human dose. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day [approximately 25,000 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day on a mg/kg basis (MRHOD)]. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 8,300 times the daily dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in humans. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 42,000 times the MRHOD), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 420 to 4,200 times higher, respectively, than the MRHOD). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, and three in vivo studies in CD-1 mice: a host-mediated assay, cytogenetic study, and dominant lethal assay. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with timolol maleate and in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical studies were conducted to compare the IOP-lowering effect over the course of the day of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered twice a day (BID) to individually-administered brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% administered three times per day (TID) and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5% BID in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID provided an additional 1 to 3 mm Hg decrease in IOP over brimonidine treatment TID and an additional 1 to 2 mm Hg decrease over timolol treatment BID during the first 7 hours post dosing. However, the IOP-lowering of brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution BID was less (approximately 1-2 mm Hg) than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol BID and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate TID. Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID had a favorable safety profile versus concurrently administered brimonidine TID and timolol BID in the self-reported level of severity of sleepiness for patients over age 40."

Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits. The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (5.0 mg/kg/day) achieved AUC exposure values 360- and 20-fold higher, or 260- and 15-fold higher, respectively, than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% or 0.15%, 1 drop in both eyes three times daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, in animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk, although in animal studies, brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , 4.1). During postmarketing surveillance, apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine. The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years.

In pediatric patients 7 years of age (>20 kg), somnolence appears to occur less frequently (25%). Approximately 16% of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients. 8.6 Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

Clinical study were conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% compared with ALPHAGAN\u00ae administered three-times-daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Those results indicated that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.15% is comparable in IOP lowering effect to ALPHAGAN\u00ae (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution) 0.2% and effectively lowers IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension by approximately 2-6 mmHg. A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% compared with ALPHAGAN\u00ae administered three-times-daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Those results indicated that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% is equivalent in IOP lowering effect to ALPHAGAN\u00ae (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution) 0.2% and effectively lowers IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension by approximately 2-6 mmHg."
