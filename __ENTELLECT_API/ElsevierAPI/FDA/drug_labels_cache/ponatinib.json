( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Arterial Occlusive Events Arterial occlusive events (AOEs), including fatalities, occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In PhALLCON, 6% of 163 patients experienced AOEs, of which 3.1%, 1.8%, and 1.2% experienced cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular AOEs, respectively. The median time to onset of the first AOE was 11.3 months (range: 8 days to 2.8 years). Grade 3 or 4 AOEs occurred in 3.7% of patients; the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 AOEs were myocardial infarction (1.2%), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (1.2%), angina pectoris and cerebrovascular accident (0.6% each). Fatal AOE of sudden death occurred in 1 patient (0.6%). AOEs were more frequent with increasing age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . In PhALLCON, patients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or diabetes were excluded. Patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, venous thromboembolism, clinically significant atrial/ventricular tachyarrhythmias, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 6 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were also excluded. In OPTIC, of the 94 patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg (45 mg \u2192 15 mg), 18% experienced AOEs, of which 11%, 4.3%, and 3.2% experienced cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular AOEs, respectively. The median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular event was 9.4 months (range: 12 days to 5.7 years), 11.7 months (range: 15 days to 1.6 years), and 6.3 months (range: 23 days to 3.6 years), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 AOEs occurred in 7% of patients; the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 AOEs were myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, arterial thrombosis, ischemic stroke, ischemic cerebral infarction, subclavian artery stenosis and unstable angina (1.1% each). Fatal AOEs occurred in 4 patients (4.3%); including sudden death (2.1%), myocardial ischemia (1.1%) and myocardial infarction (1.1%). AOEs were more frequent with increasing age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . In OPTIC, patients with uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, congestive heart failure, venous thromboembolism, or clinically significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmias, were excluded. In PACE, 26% of 449 patients experienced AOEs, of which 15%, 7%, and 11% experienced cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular AOEs, respectively. Some patients experienced recurrent or multisite vascular occlusion. The median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular AOEs was 1 year (range: 1 day to 4.1 years), 1.4 years (range: 2 days to 4.5 years), and 2 years (range: 10 days to 4.9 years), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 AOEs occurred in 14% of patients; the most frequent Grade 3 or 4 AOEs were peripheral arterial occlusive disease (3.1%), myocardial infarction (2%), coronary artery disease (1.6%), and cerebral infarction (1.6%). Fatal AOEs occurred in 9 patients (2%); the most frequent fatal AOE was cardiac arrest (0.9%). In PACE, fatal and life-threatening AOEs occurred within 2 weeks of starting treatment at 45 mg, and at dose levels as low as 15 mg per day. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced AOEs. AOEs were more frequent with increasing age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] and in patients with history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. The most common risk factors in patients with AOEs were history of hypertension (67%; 77/115), hypercholesterolemia (59%; 68/115), and non-ischemic cardiac disease (43%; 49/115). In PACE, patients developed heart failure concurrent or subsequent to a myocardial ischemic event [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Patients required revascularization procedures (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial). ICLUSIG caused stenosis over multiple segments in major arterial vessels that supply the brain (e.g., carotid, vertebral, middle cerebral artery). Patients developed digital or distal extremity necrosis and required amputations. Renal artery stenosis associated with worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension occurred in some ICLUSIG-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . In PACE, patients with uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and patients with clinically significant or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of clinically significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmias or history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 3 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were excluded [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Consider whether the benefits of ICLUSIG are expected to exceed the risks. Monitor for evidence of AOEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Consider benefit-risk to guide a decision to restart ICLUSIG. 5.2 Venous Thromboembolic Events Serious or severe VTEs have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG.

Three patients (3.2%) experienced hypertensive crisis. In PACE, hypertension events were reported in 32% of 449 patients; 13% experienced serious or severe hypertension. Any post-baseline elevation of systolic or diastolic BP of Grade 2 or higher in patients with normal baseline blood pressure occurred in 44% of 449 patients. Grade 1 BP elevation occurred in 26%, Grade 2 in 45%, and Grade 3 in 26%. Two patients (<1%) experienced Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis). Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor blood pressure at baseline and as clinically indicated and manage hypertension as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop ICLUSIG if hypertension is not medically controlled [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . For significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt ICLUSIG and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis. 5.6 Pancreatitis Serious or severe pancreatitis has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PhALLCON, pancreatitis occurred in 34% of 163 patients; 15% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) pancreatitis.

Monitor serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Evaluate for pancreatitis when lipase elevation is accompanied by abdominal symptoms. 5.7 Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with CP-CML, single agent ICLUSIG 45 mg once daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the ICLUSIG arm compared to the imatinib arm.

The most common adverse reactions identified in the Highlights of the Prescribing Information are based on two safety populations. The first is from a pooled safety population of 543 patients with CML or resistant or intolerant Ph+ ALL (OPTIC and PACE studies) who received ICLUSIG as a single agent at a starting dose of 45 mg orally once daily. In this pooled safety population, the most common (>20%) adverse reactions were rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, constipation, hypertension, dry skin, hepatotoxicity, fluid retention and edema, pyrexia, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, nausea, hemorrhage, anemia, AOEs and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>20%) were platelet count decreased, neutrophil cell count decreased, and white blood cell decreased. The second safety population is from 163 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL (PhALLCON study) who received ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy at a starting dose of 30 mg orally once daily. The most common adverse reactions (>20%) included hepatotoxicity, arthralgia, rash and related conditions, headache, pyrexia, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, hypertension, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, neuropathy peripheral, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, fluid retention and edema, vomiting, paresthesia, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Newly Diagnosed Ph+ ALL The safety of ICLUSIG was evaluated in PhALLCON, a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter trial conducted in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients received ICLUSIG (n=163) or imatinib 600 mg (n=81) in combination with reduced-intensity chemotherapy followed by continued treatment with ICLUSIG or imatinib as a single agent (imatinib in combination with chemotherapy is not an approved regimen in adult patients). In the ICLUSIG arm, patients received a starting dosage of ICLUSIG 30 mg orally once daily in combination with chemotherapy, with a reduction to 15 mg orally once daily upon achievement of MRD-negative CR at the end of induction. The median duration of exposure was 9.0 months (range: <1 month to 4.2 years) in the ICLUSIG arm and 5.2 months (range: <1 month to 4.4 years) in the imatinib arm. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, venous thromboembolism, clinically significant atrial/ventricular tachyarrhythmias, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 6 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were excluded.

Patients received one of three starting doses of ICLUSIG: 45 mg orally once daily (n=94), 30 mg orally once daily (n=94), or 15 mg orally once daily (n=94). Patients with uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, congestive heart failure, venous thromboembolism, or clinically significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmias, were excluded. Only the safety information for the recommended starting dosage (45 mg) is described below. Patients who received a starting dose of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily had a mandatory dose reduction to 15 mg once daily upon achievement of \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS . Of these patients, 76% were exposed for 1 year or longer, 59% were exposed for two years or longer and 43% were exposed to five years or longer. The median time to the response-based dose reduction to 15 mg was 6.4 months (range: 3.1 months to 1.8 years). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included AOEs (13%; of which 2.1% were sudden death), cardiac arrhythmias (9%; of which 2.1% were atrial fibrillation), thrombocytopenia (5%), pyrexia (4.3%), anemia (3.2%), abdominal pain (3.2%), pancreatitis/lipase elevation (2.1%), neutropenia (2.1%), hypertension (2.1%) and hepatotoxicity (2.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4 patients (4.3%), including sudden death (2.1%), myocardial infarction (1.1%) and myocardial ischemia (1.1%). Permanent discontinuation of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 24% of patients who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in >2% of patients included AOEs, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and sudden death. Dose modifications (dose interruption or reductions) of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 81% of patients who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg. Adverse reactions which required dose interruptions or reductions in >5% of patients included thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, rash and related conditions, anemia, cardiac arrhythmias, AOEs, and cardiac failure. The most common (>20%) adverse reactions were rash and related conditions, hypertension, hepatoxicity, hyperlipidemia, arthralgia, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, abdominal pain and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common (>20%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were platelet count decreased and neutrophil cell count decreased.

Eligible patients had CML or Ph+ ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to prior kinase inhibitor, including those with the BCR::ABL T315I mutation. Patients with uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and patients with clinically significant or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of clinically significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmias or history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 3 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were excluded. Patients received a starting dose of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily (N=449). Dose reductions to 30 mg orally once daily or 15 mg orally once daily were allowed for the management of adverse reactions. After approximately 2 years of follow-up, patients who were still taking a 45 mg orally once daily dose were recommended to undergo a dose reduction in response to the continued occurrence of AOEs and VTEs in the clinical trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . At study completion (60 months of follow-up), the median duration of treatment with ICLUSIG was 32 months in patients with CP-CML, 19 months in patients with AP-CML, 2.9 months in patients with BP-CML, and 2.7 months in patients with Ph+ ALL. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients who received ICLUSIG. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included AOEs (20%), pneumonia (10%), cardiac arrhythmias (8%), pancreatitis/lipase elevation (7%), abdominal pain (6%), cardiac failure (6%), hemorrhage (6%), sepsis (5%), VTEs (5%), fluid retention and edema (4.5%), pyrexia (4.5%), secondary malignancies (5%), anemia (3.3%), hypertension (3.1%), thrombocytopenia (3.1%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%), cellulitis (2.7%), and arthralgia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 9% of patients who received ICLUSIG; the most frequent fatal adverse reactions were AOEs (2%), sepsis (1.6%), and hemorrhage (1.3%). Permanent discontinuation of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of CP-CML, 12% of AP-CML, 15% of BP-CML, and 9% of Ph+ ALL patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were thrombocytopenia (4.5%) and AOEs (4%). Dose interruption of ICLUSIG for more than 3 days due to an adverse reaction occurred in 71% of patients and dose reduction of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 68% of patients. Adverse reactions which required a dosage interruption or dose reduction in >5% of patients included thrombocytopenia (31%), pancreatitis/lipase elevation (17%), abdominal pain (14%), rash and related conditions (14%), neutropenia (14%), hepatotoxicity (12%), AOEs (10%), arthralgia (8%), anemia (7%), ALT increased (6%), and AST increased (5%). The most common (>20%) non-hematologic adverse reactions were rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, fatigue, constipation, headache, dry skin, fluid retention and edema, hepatotoxicity, hypertension, pyrexia, nausea, hemorrhage, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, AOEs, diarrhea, vomiting, and myalgia.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , ICLUSIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on ICLUSIG use in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ponatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at doses lower than human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose of 45 mg/day (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Ponatinib was studied for effects on embryo-fetal development in pregnant rats given oral doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, and 3 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (25 rats per group). At the maternally toxic dose of 3 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 45 mg/day), ponatinib caused embryo-fetal toxicity as shown by increased resorptions, reduced body weight, external alterations, multiple soft tissue and skeletal alterations, and reduced ossification. Embryo-fetal toxicities also were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 24% the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 45 mg/day) and involved multiple fetal soft tissue and skeletal alterations, including reduced ossification. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ponatinib in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential ICLUSIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ICLUSIG. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 3 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females Based on animal data, ponatinib may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ICLUSIG have not been established in pediatric patients. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data A juvenile toxicity study in 15 day old rats was conducted with daily oral gavage administration of ponatinib at 0.75 mg/kg/day, 1.5 mg/kg/day, or 3 mg/kg/day for 21 days. There were no adverse effects of ponatinib on juvenile rat developmental parameters (vaginal opening, preputial separation or bone measurements) observed in this study. Once daily oral administration of 3 mg/kg/day ponatinib to juvenile rats beginning on Day 15 postpartum (pp) resulted in mortality related to inflammatory effects after 6 to 7 days following initiation of treatment. The dose of 3 mg/kg/day is approximately 0.32 times the maximum recommended human dose of 45 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis for a child. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 163 patients with Ph+ALL who received ICLUSIG in PhALLCON, 21% were 65 years and older and 7% were 75 years and older. Overall, no differences in efficacy of ICLUSIG were observed between patients 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. AOEs occurred in 21% (7/34) of patients 65 years and older and 2.3% (3/129) of patients less than 65 years of age. Of the 94 patients with CP-CML who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg in OPTIC, 17% were 65 years and older and 2.1% were 75 years and older. Patients aged 65 years and older had a lower \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS rate at 12 months (27%) than patients less than 65 years of age (47%). By 60 months, patients aged 65 years and older had a \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS rate of 40% and patients less than 65 years of age had a rate of 64%. AOEs occurred in 38% (6/16) of patients 65 years and older and 14% (11/78) of patients less than 65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Of the 449 patients who received ICLUSIG in PACE, 35% were 65 years and older and 8% were 75 years and older. In patients with CP-CML, patients aged 65 years and older had a lower major cytogenetic response rate (40%) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age (65%). In patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL, patients aged 65 years and older had a similar hematologic response rate (45%) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age (44%). AOEs occurred in 35% (54/155) of patients 65 years and older and in 21% (61/294) of patients less than 65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients aged 65 years or older are more likely to experience adverse reactions including vascular occlusion, decreased platelet count, peripheral edema, increased lipase, dyspnea, asthenia, muscle spasms, and decreased appetite. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment are more likely to experience adverse reactions compared to patients with normal hepatic function. For patients with CP-CML, AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL receiving monotherapy, reduce the starting dose of ICLUSIG for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B, or C). For patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, dosage adjustment is not recommended when administering ICLUSIG to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). Clinical data in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL with pre-existing moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) is not available and patients should be closely monitored for potential increased incidence of adverse reactions. Modify the ICLUSIG dosage in the event of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety of multiple doses, or doses higher than 30 mg, has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

Embryo-fetal toxicities also were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 24% the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 45 mg/day) and involved multiple fetal soft tissue and skeletal alterations, including reduced ossification."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ICLUSIG have not been established in pediatric patients. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data A juvenile toxicity study in 15 day old rats was conducted with daily oral gavage administration of ponatinib at 0.75 mg/kg/day, 1.5 mg/kg/day, or 3 mg/kg/day for 21 days. There were no adverse effects of ponatinib on juvenile rat developmental parameters (vaginal opening, preputial separation or bone measurements) observed in this study. Once daily oral administration of 3 mg/kg/day ponatinib to juvenile rats beginning on Day 15 postpartum (pp) resulted in mortality related to inflammatory effects after 6 to 7 days following initiation of treatment. The dose of 3 mg/kg/day is approximately 0.32 times the maximum recommended human dose of 45 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis for a child."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 163 patients with Ph+ALL who received ICLUSIG in PhALLCON, 21% were 65 years and older and 7% were 75 years and older. Overall, no differences in efficacy of ICLUSIG were observed between patients 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. AOEs occurred in 21% (7/34) of patients 65 years and older and 2.3% (3/129) of patients less than 65 years of age. Of the 94 patients with CP-CML who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg in OPTIC, 17% were 65 years and older and 2.1% were 75 years and older. Patients aged 65 years and older had a lower \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS rate at 12 months (27%) than patients less than 65 years of age (47%). By 60 months, patients aged 65 years and older had a \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS rate of 40% and patients less than 65 years of age had a rate of 64%. AOEs occurred in 38% (6/16) of patients 65 years and older and 14% (11/78) of patients less than 65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Of the 449 patients who received ICLUSIG in PACE, 35% were 65 years and older and 8% were 75 years and older. In patients with CP-CML, patients aged 65 years and older had a lower major cytogenetic response rate (40%) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age (65%). In patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL, patients aged 65 years and older had a similar hematologic response rate (45%) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age (44%). AOEs occurred in 35% (54/155) of patients 65 years and older and in 21% (61/294) of patients less than 65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients aged 65 years or older are more likely to experience adverse reactions including vascular occlusion, decreased platelet count, peripheral edema, increased lipase, dyspnea, asthenia, muscle spasms, and decreased appetite. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Two hours after the overdosage, the patient had an uncorrected QT interval of 520 ms. Subsequent ECGs showed normal sinus rhythm with uncorrected QT intervals of 480 ms and 400 ms. The patient died 9 days after the overdosage from pneumonia and sepsis. Another patient self-administered 165 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2. The patient experienced fatigue and non-cardiac chest pain on Day 3. Multiple doses of 90 mg per day for 12 days in a patient resulted in pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response, atrial fibrillation, and a moderate pericardial effusion. In the event of an overdosage, stop ICLUSIG, observe the patient and provide supportive treatment as appropriate."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ponatinib is a kinase inhibitor. Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and T315I mutant ABL with IC 50 concentrations of 0.4 nM and 2.0 nM, respectively. Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro activity of additional kinases with IC 50 concentrations between 0.1 nM and 20 nM, including members of the VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, EPH receptors and SRC families of kinases, and KIT, RET, TIE2, and FLT3. Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing native or mutant BCR::ABL, including T315I. In mice, treatment with ponatinib reduced the size of tumors expressing native or T315I mutant BCR::ABL when compared to controls. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In PACE, the dose intensity-safety relationship indicated that there are significant increases in Grade \u22653 adverse reactions (hypertension, thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, neutropenia, rash, ALT increase, AST increase, lipase increase, myelosuppression) over the dose range of 15 mg to 45 mg. In addition to dose, increased age and history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia were also contributory factors to a higher incidence of AOEs. In OPTIC, an exposure-response relationship between ponatinib exposure and molecular response rate at 12 months was observed. A relationship between higher ponatinib exposures and higher incidence of adverse reactions, including thrombocytopenia (Grade \u22653) and AOEs, was observed. In vitro, there was no significant inhibition of platelet aggregation with ponatinib at concentrations seen clinically and up to 0.7 mcg/mL (1.23 \u03bcM). Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT interval prolongation potential of ICLUSIG was assessed in 39 patients with cancer who received ICLUSIG 30 mg, 45 mg, or 60 mg (0.67 to 1.33 times the approved maximum recommended starting dose) orally once daily. No large mean increase (i.e., >20 msec) in QTc interval was detected. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ponatinib administered to patients with cancer exhibited approximately dose proportional increases in both steady-state C max and AUC over the dose range of 2 mg to 60 mg (0.04 to 1.33 times the approved maximum recommended starting dose). The mean (CV%) C max and AUC( 0-24 ) of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily at presumed steady-state in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were 73 ng/mL (74%) and 1253 ng\u2219hr/mL (73%), respectively. The mean (CV%) C max and AUC( 0-24 ) of ICLUSIG 30 mg orally once daily at presumed steady-state in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were 65 ng/mL (28%) and 1080 ng\u2219hr/mL (29%), respectively. Exposure increased by approximately 90% (median) [range: 20% to 440%] between the first dose and presumed steady-state. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of ponatinib is unknown. Peak concentrations of ponatinib are observed within 6 hours after ICLUSIG oral administration. Effect of Food Following ingestion of either a high-fat (approximately 900 to 1000 calories with approximately 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories derived from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) or low-fat meal (approximately 547 calories with approximately 56, 428 and 63 calories derived from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) by 22 healthy volunteers, plasma ponatinib exposures (AUC and C max ) were not different when compared to fasting conditions. Distribution Ponatinib is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins in vitro. There was no plasma protein binding displacement of ponatinib (145 nM) in vitro by other highly protein bound medications (ibuprofen, nifedipine, propranolol, salicylic acid, and warfarin). The mean (CV%) apparent steady-state volume of distribution is 1,223 liters (102%) following oral administration of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily for 28 days in patients with cancer. Elimination The mean (range) terminal elimination half-life of ponatinib was approximately 24 (12 to 66) hours following ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily for 28 days in patients with cancer. Metabolism At least 64% of a dose undergoes Phase I and Phase II metabolism. CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 are involved in the Phase I metabolism of ponatinib in vitro . Ponatinib is also metabolized by esterases and/or amidases. Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled ponatinib, approximately 87% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the feces and approximately 5% in the urine. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ponatinib were observed based on age (19 to 85 years), body weight (41 to 152 kg), and mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min, estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation). Patients with Renal Impairment ICLUSIG has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. Although renal excretion is not a major route of ponatinib elimination, the potential for severe renal impairment to affect hepatic elimination has not been determined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A single 30 mg oral dose of ICLUSIG was administered to subjects with normal hepatic function and to subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B), and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, there was no trend of increased ponatinib exposure in subjects with hepatic impairment. There was an increased incidence of adverse reactions (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, including a case of severe pancreatitis) in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of ponatinib with multiple doses of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased the ponatinib AUC 0-INF by 78% and C max by 47%. Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of ponatinib with multiple doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased the ponatinib AUC 0-INF by 62% and C max by 42%. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: Coadministration of ponatinib with multiple doses of lansoprazole (proton pump inhibitor) decreased the ponatinib AUC 0-INF by 6% and C max by 25%. In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Ponatinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, or CYP2D6 and does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Transporter Systems: Ponatinib is a weak substrate for both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Ponatinib is not a substrate for organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). Ponatinib inhibits P-gp, BCRP, and bile salt export pump (BSEP). Ponatinib does not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, or the organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3."

Exposures in animals at the highest dose tested were 0.3- to 0.8-fold the human exposure (based on AUC) at doses of 15 mg and 45 mg daily. Ponatinib induced a statistically significant increase in malignant squamous neoplasms of the clitoral gland in females at 0.8 mg/kg/day. Ponatinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg. Ponatinib may impair female fertility.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Newly Diagnosed Ph+ ALL The efficacy of ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy was evaluated in PhALLCON (NCT03589326), a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label trial of 245 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. Randomization was stratified by age at the time of induction therapy (18 to <45 years; \u226545 to <60 years; and \u226560 years). Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either ICLUSIG 30 mg orally once daily (n=164) or imatinib 600 mg orally once daily (n=81) in combination with chemotherapy (imatinib in combination with chemotherapy is an unapproved regimen in adult patients). The ICLUSIG dose was reduced to 15 mg once daily after completion of the induction phase and achievement of MRD-negative complete remission (CR). If a patient lost MRD negativity at any time after dose reduction to 15 mg, re-escalation to 30 mg once daily was allowed. Only patients who achieved CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) with MRD-negativity at the end of induction could continue study treatment at the investigator\u2019s discretion. Per protocol, patients were allowed to receive one cycle of optional prephase therapy excluding TKI prior to randomization to manage the acute disease during the screening period. Patients were randomized to receive either ICLUSIG or imatinib in combination with 20 cycles of chemotherapy, followed by ICLUSIG or imatinib as single-agent therapy (ICLUSIG or imatinib as single-agent after chemotherapy for newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL is not an approved regimen). Each cycle lasted 28 days. Induction (Cycles 1 to 3): ICLUSIG 30 mg or imatinib 600 mg once daily in combination with: Vincristine : 1.4 mg/m 2 IV on Days 1 and 14; capped at 2 mg and Dexamethasone : <60 years old \u2013 40 mg orally on Days 1 to 4 and Days 11 to 14; \u226560 years old: 20 mg orally on Days 1 to 4 and Days 11 to 14. Consolidation (Cycles 4 to 9, alternating methotrexate and cytarabine): ICLUSIG 30 mg (or decreased to 15 mg if in MRD-negative CR) or imatinib 600 mg once daily in combination with: Methotrexate (Cycles 4, 6, and 8): <60 years old \u2013 1000 mg/m 2 IV on Day 1; \u226560 years old \u2013 250 mg/m 2 IV, Day 1 or Cytarabine (Cycles 5, 7, and 9): <60 years old \u2013 1000 mg/m 2 IV every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5; \u226560 years old \u2013 250 mg/m 2 IV every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5. Maintenance (Cycles 10 to 20): ICLUSIG 30 mg (or decreased to 15 mg if in MRD-negative CR) or imatinib 600 mg once daily in combination with: Vincristine : 1.4 mg/m 2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle; capped at 2 mg and Prednisone : <60 years old \u2013 200 mg orally on Days 1 to 5; \u226560 to 69 years old \u2013 100 mg orally on Days 1 to 5; \u226570 years old \u2013 50 mg orally on Days 1 to 5. Following combination therapy, patients continued to receive ICLUSIG or imatinib as single-agent therapy until relapse from CR, progressive disease (PD), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), start of alternative therapy, or unacceptable toxicity.

MRD-negative CR MRD-negative CR is defined as \u22640.01% BCR::ABL1/ABL1 or undetectable BCR::ABL1 transcripts in cDNA with \u226510,000 ABL1 transcripts, and meeting criteria for CR at End of Induction Achieved at the end of induction % (n/N) 30% (46/154) 12% (9/78) Risk difference (95% CI) Difference, 95% CI and two-sided p-value are based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method stratified by the randomization stratification factor. 0.18 (0.08, 0.28) p-value 0.0004 CR CR is defined as no circulating blasts and <5% blasts in the bone marrow with normal maturation of all cellular components; no evidence of extramedullary disease (i.e., CNS involvement, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin/gum infiltration, testicular mass); and hematologic recovery of absolute neutrophil count >1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelets >100 \u00d7 10 9 /L for at least 4 weeks. at End of Induction % (n/N) 79% (122/154) 63% (49/78) The median duration of follow-up for overall survival was 20.4 months (95% CI: 18.4, 23.9) in the ICLUSIG arm and 18.1 months (95% CI: 13.9, 24.3) in the imatinib arm. In the subset of patients who did not receive prephase therapy, MRD-negative CR at the end of induction was achieved by 31% of patients in the ICLUSIG arm compared to 16% of patients in the imatinib arm and CR at the end of induction was achieved by 84% and 61%, respectively. Chronic Phase (CP) CML The efficacy of ICLUSIG was evaluated in OPTIC (NCT02467270), a dose-optimization trial. Eligible patients had CP-CML whose disease was considered to be resistant or resistant/intolerant to at least 2 prior kinase inhibitors or who have the T315I mutation. T315I mutation testing was performed on peripheral blood by Sanger Sequencing of the p190 or p210 BCR::ABL region. Resistance in CP-CML while on a prior kinase inhibitor was defined as failure to achieve either a complete hematologic response (by 3 months), a minor cytogenetic response (by 6 months), or a major cytogenetic response (by 12 months), or development of a new BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation or new clonal evolution. Patients were required to have >1% BCR::ABL1 IS (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) at trial entry. Patients received one of three starting dosages: 45 mg orally once daily, 30 mg orally once daily, or 15 mg orally once daily. Patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg or 30 mg had a dose reduction to 15 mg once daily upon achieving \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS . The major efficacy outcome measure was \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS at 12 months. Only the efficacy results for the recommended starting dose of 45 mg are described below. The median duration of follow-up for the 45 mg cohort (N=94) was 72.9 months (range: 0.5 months to 106.3 months). A total of 282 patients received ICLUSIG: 94 received a starting dose of 45 mg, 94 received a starting dose of 30 mg, and 94 received a starting dose of 15 mg. Baseline demographic characteristics are described in Table 13 for patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg.

Table 14: Efficacy Results in Patients with CP-CML Who Received ICLUSIG at Starting Dose of 45 mg in OPTIC ICLUSIG 45 mg \u2192 15 mg (N = 93) ITT population (N=93) defined as patients who had the b2a2/b3a2 (p210) transcript. Molecular Response at 12 months Primary endpoint was \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS rate at 12 months. Defined as a \u22641% ratio of BCR::ABL to ABL transcripts on the International Scale (IS) (i.e., \u22641% BCR::ABL IS ; patients must have the b2a2/b3a2 (p210) transcript), in peripheral blood measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). Overall \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS Rate % (n/N) 44% (41/93) (95% CI) 95% CI is calculated using the binomial exact (Clopper-Pearson) method. (34%, 55%) Patients with T315I mutation % (n/N) 44% (11/25) (95% CI) (24%, 65%) Patients without T315I mutation % (n/N) 44% (29/66) Of the 93 patients, two patients did not have a baseline mutation assessment and were excluded from the response by mutation analysis. (95% CI) (32%, 57%) Cytogenetic Response by 12 months Major (MCyR) Secondary endpoint was MCyR by 12 months which combines both complete (no detectable Ph+ cells) and partial (1% to 35% Ph+ cells in at least 20 metaphases) cytogenetic responses. % (n/N) 48% (44/91) Analysis is based on ITT cytogenetic population (N=91) defined as patients who had a cytogenetic assessment at baseline with at least 20 metaphases examined. One patient who had a complete cytogenetic response at baseline was excluded from the analysis. (95% CI) (38%, 59%) Patients with T315I mutation % (n/N) 52% (13/25) (95% CI) (31%, 72%) Patients without T315I mutation % (n/N) 46% (30/65) Of the 91 patients, one patient did not have a baseline mutation assessment and was excluded from the response by mutation analysis. (95% CI) (34%, 59%) The rate of molecular response (\u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS ) by 60 months was 60.2% (95% CI 49.5, 70.0). In patients with T3151 mutation, it was 64.0% (95% CI 42.5, 82.0) and in patients without T3151 mutation, it was 59.1% (95% CI, 46.3, 71.0). Of the 45 patients who had a dose reduction to 15 mg after achieving \u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS , 25 patients (56%) maintained their response at the reduced dose for at least one year. Of these 25 patients, 16 patients (64%) maintained response for greater than 60 months. With a minimum follow-up of 60 months, median duration of molecular response (\u22641% BCR::ABL1 IS ) was not reached. Chronic Phase (CP), Accelerated Phase (AP), Blast Phase (BP) CML and Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ ALL) The efficacy of ICLUSIG was evaluated in PACE (NCT01207440), a single-arm, open-label, international, multicenter trial. Eligible patients had CML and Ph+ ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to a prior kinase inhibitor. Patients were assigned to one of six cohorts based on disease phase (CP-CML, AP-CML, or BP-CML/Ph+ ALL), resistance or intolerance (R/I) to prior kinase inhibitors, and the presence of the T315I mutation. T315I mutation testing was performed on peripheral blood by Sanger Sequencing of the p190 or p210 BCR::ABL region. Resistance in CP-CML while on a prior kinase inhibitor was defined as failure to achieve either a complete hematologic response (by 3 months), a minor cytogenetic response (by 6 months), or a major cytogenetic response (by 12 months). Patients with CP-CML who experienced a loss of response or development of a kinase domain mutation in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response or progression to AP-CML or BP-CML at any time on a prior kinase inhibitor were also considered resistant. Resistance in AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL was defined as failure to achieve either a major hematologic response (by 3 months in AP-CML, and by 1 month in BP-CML and Ph+ ALL), loss of major hematologic response (at any time), or development of a kinase domain mutation in the absence of a complete major hematologic response while on a prior kinase inhibitor. Intolerance was defined as the discontinuation of a prior kinase inhibitor due to toxicities despite optimal management in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response in patients with CP-CML or major hematologic response for patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, or Ph+ ALL. Patients were administered a starting dose of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily. The major efficacy outcome measure for patients with CP-CML was major cytogenetic response (MCyR), which included complete and partial cytogenetic responses (CCyR and PCyR). The major efficacy outcome measure for patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL was major hematologic response (MaHR), defined as either a complete hematologic response (CHR) or no evidence of leukemia (NEL). The trial enrolled 449 patients, of which 444 were eligible for efficacy analysis: 267 patients with CP-CML (R/I Cohort: N=203, T315I: N=64), 83 patients with AP-CML, 62 patients with BP-CML, and 32 patients with Ph+ ALL. Five patients were not eligible for efficacy analysis due to lack of confirmation of T315I mutation status, and these patients had not received prior dasatinib or nilotinib. At study completion, the median duration of follow-up for the trial (all cohorts) was 40.5 months (range: 0.1 months to 79.5 months). The median duration of treatment was 35 months for patients with CP-CML, 21.1 months for patients with AP-CML, 3.2 months for patients with BP-CML and 2.9 months for patients with Ph+ ALL.

Defined as a \u22640.1% ratio of BCR::ABL to ABL transcripts on the International Scale (IS) (i.e., \u22640.1% BCR::ABL IS ; patients must have the b2a2/b3a2 (p210) transcript), in peripheral blood measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). (95% CI) 40% (35%, 47%) 35% (28%, 42%) 58% (45%, 70%) In patients with CP-CML who achieved MCyR or MMR, the median time to response was 3 months (range: 1.8 to 12.3 months) and 6 months (range: 2 to 60.2 months), respectively. With a minimum follow-up of 60 months, the median durations of MCyR (range: 1 day to 70.1 months) and MMR (range: 1 day to 67.8 months) had not yet been reached.

Revised: 10/2025 MEDICATION GUIDE ICLUSIG \u00ae (eye-CLUE-sig) (ponatinib) tablets What is the most important information I should know about ICLUSIG? ICLUSIG can cause serious side effects, including: Blood clots or blockage in your blood vessels (arteries and veins). Blood clots or blockage in your blood vessels may lead to heart attack, stroke, or death. A blood clot or blockage in your blood vessels can prevent proper blood flow to your heart, brain, bowels (intestines), legs, eyes, and other parts of your body. You may need emergency surgery or treatment in a hospital. Get medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms: chest pain or pressure pain in your arms, legs, back, neck or jaw shortness of breath numbness or weakness on one side of your body leg swelling trouble talking headache dizziness severe stomach area pain decreased vision or loss of vision Blood clots or blockage in your blood vessels can happen in people with or without risk factors for heart and blood vessel disease, including people 50 years of age or younger. The most common risk factors for these problems are a history of high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, and heart disease. Blood clots or blockages in your blood vessels happen more often in people as they get older, and in people with a history of decreased blood flow, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. Heart problems. ICLUSIG can cause heart problems, including heart failure which can be serious and may lead to death. Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough.
