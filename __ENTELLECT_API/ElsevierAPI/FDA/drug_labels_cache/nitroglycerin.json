      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer one tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. \u2022 At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible.",

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism.

At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3\u2011dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3\u2011dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. They are used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: \u2022 very recent heart attack \u2022 severe anemia \u2022 increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic\u2011thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: \u2022 You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. \u2022 You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. \u2022 You are taking any diuretics (water pills). \u2022 You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). \u2022 You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. \u2022 You are taking aspirin. \u2022 You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. \u2022 You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. \u2022 You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? \u2022 Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . \u2022 You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. \u2022 One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. \u2022 The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. \u2022 If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. \u2022 Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. \u2022 You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? \u2022 Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. \u2022 Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. \u2022 Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: \u2022 headache \u2022 vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) \u2022 dizziness \u2022 weakness \u2022 heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) \u2022 low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 sweating \u2022 paleness \u2022 fainting \u2022 flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) \u2022 other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience.

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

(4.1, 7.1) Severe anemia (4.2) Increased intracranial pressure (4.3) Hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin sublingual tablets or to other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient (4.4) Circulatory failure and shock (4.5) 4.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking PDE-5 Inhibitors, such as avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. 4.2 Severe Anemia Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe anemia (large doses of nitroglycerin may cause oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin and could exacerbate anemia). 4.3 Increased Intracranial Pressure Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may precipitate or aggravate increased intracranial pressure and thus should not be used in patients with possible increased intracranial pressure (e.g., cerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury). 4.4 Hypersensitivity Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to nitroglycerin, other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient. 4.5 Circulatory Failure and Shock Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute circulatory failure or shock."

(5.2) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.2) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "Patient Information Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or for more information, call Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males.

Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: \u2022 very recent heart attack \u2022 severe anemia \u2022 increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: \u2022 You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. \u2022 You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. \u2022 You are taking any diuretics (water pills). \u2022 You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). \u2022 You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. \u2022 You are taking aspirin. \u2022 You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. \u2022 You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. \u2022 You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? \u2022 Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . \u2022 You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. \u2022 One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. \u2022 The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. \u2022 If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. \u2022 Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. \u2022 You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? \u2022 Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. \u2022 Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. \u2022 Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: \u2022 headache \u2022 vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) \u2022 dizziness \u2022 weakness \u2022 heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) \u2022 low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 sweating \u2022 paleness \u2022 fainting \u2022 flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) \u2022 other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or you can call NATCO Pharma USA LLC at 201-786-6500.

One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "Patient Information Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nye\" troe glis' er in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, or call Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

Marked sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of nitrates (manifested by nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis, pallor, and collapse) may occur at therapeutic doses. Syncope due to nitrate vasodilatation has been reported. Flushing, drug rash, and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported in patients receiving nitrate therapy. Most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency greater than 2% are headache, dizziness and paresthesia.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Parameter Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "Patient Information Nitroglycerin (nahy- truh -glis-er-in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets?

(5.2) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.2) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration."

Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "Patient Information Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or for more information, call Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Parameter Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets?

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer one tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1,058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Product of USA Manufactured by: NATCO PHARMA LIMITED Kothur- 509 228, Telangana, India Manufactured for: NATCO Pharma USA LLC, Parsippany, NJ 07054, USA Revised: 07/2023 PATIENT INFORMATION Nitroglycerin (nye\u201d troe glis\u2019 er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or you can call NATCO Pharma USA LLC at 201-786-6500.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2-and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials: Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, and SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. In patients with pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis, cardiac output is dependent upon venous return. Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions. Nitroglycerin is also contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Do not use Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors) such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Use of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) tubing in infusion sets may lead to loss of active ingredient due to adsorption of nitroglycerin to PVC tubing, therefore dosage is affected (see Dosage and Administration ). Nitroglycerin adsorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Relatively non-adsorptive intravenous administration sets are available. If intravenous nitroglycerin is administered through non-adsorptive tubing, doses based upon published reports will generally be too high. Some in-line intravenous filters also adsorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Solutions containing dextrose without electrolytes should not be administered through the same administration set as blood, as this may result in pseudoagglutination or hemolysis. The intravenous administration of solutions may cause fluid overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration and congested states of pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. Monitor patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Tolerance development and occurrence of cross tolerance to other nitro compounds have been reported. In industrial workers who have long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Administer nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection via an infusion pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection has not been studied. Monitor patients with known sub-clinical or overt diabetes mellitus when using solutions containing dextrose. Laboratory Tests: Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants) and may cause increased hypotensive effects.. Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications ). Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications ). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Nitroglycerin at higher dosages may interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Intravenous nitroglycerin can induce heparin resistance. Administration of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. Do not mix Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with any other medication of any kind. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, and no toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. However, the relationship between hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin and dose in the pediatric population have been documented in the literature. Studies in the literature used doses of nitroglycerin injection in pediatric patients ranging from 0.5 to 5 mcg/kg/min. The following equation can be used to calculate the flow rate in mL/hour of nitroglycerin using the 100 mcg/mL (25 mg/250 mL) concentration of nitroglycerin. Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/kg/min) x Weight (kg) x 60 min/h] Final Concentration (mcg/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a 2 kg child at a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [0.5 (mcg/kg/min) x 2 (kg) x 60 (min/h) ] = 0.6 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Example 2: for a 10 kg child at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/kg/min) x 10 (kg) x 60 (min/h) ] = 30 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Note: Very low infusion rates may require that a more dilute concentration of nitroglycerin infusion solution be prepared. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Do not use unless vacuum is present and solution is clear."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see Overdosage ). Dyspnea has also been reported. Data are not available to allow estimation of the frequency of adverse reactions during treatment with Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of overdose are generally similar to the described adverse reactions (see Adverse Reactions ). There is no specific antidote for overdose of nitroglycerin. The risk of overdose can be minimized by close monitoring during treatment. Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which -if any- of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u2265 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported with moderate doses of organic nitrates. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, discontinue treatment of nitroglycerin. If condition is not reversed, treat with methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. Administer Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection only via an infusion pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Do not use a container which has lost its vacuum, or one in which particulate matter is visible. Dosage is affected by the type of infusion set used (see Warnings ). Although the usual adult starting dose in published studies has been 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC tubing, so the delivered doses were less than those reported. When nonadsorptive tubing is used, doses must be reduced (see Warnings and Precautions ). The dosage must be determined by the patient\u2019s individual requirement and depending on the required response and possible adverse effects (see Adverse Reactions ). Even using nonadsorptive tubing, the dose necessary to achieve a given response will vary greatly from patient to patient. Patients with normal or low left-ventricular filling pressure ( e.g. , patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris) may respond fully to as little as 5 mcg/min, while other patients may require a dose that is one or even two orders of magnitude higher. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary in all patients receiving this medication; in many cases, invasive monitoring of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure will also be indicated. Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. The necessary flow rates to achieve various dose rates with the available concentrations are shown in the following table. Using nonadsorptive tubing, the initial adult dosage of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be 5 mcg/min. Subsequent titration must be guided by the clinical results, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments at intervals of 3 to 5 minutes. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and even 20 mcg/min can be used. Once some hemodynamic response is observed, dosage increments should be smaller and less frequent. When the concentration is changed, the tubing must be disconnected from the patient and flushed with the new solution before therapy is continued. If this precaution is not taken, then depending upon the tubing, pump, and flow rate used, it might be several hours before nitroglycerin is delivered at the desired rate. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not add supplementary medication to Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection. Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/min) x 60 min/h] Concentration (mcg/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a dose of 30 \u00b5g/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [30 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h) ] = 18 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Example 2: for a dose of 240 mcg/min using a 400 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h) ] = 36 (mL/h) 400 (mcg/mL)"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

Marked sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of nitrates (manifested by nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis, pallor, and collapse) may occur at therapeutic doses. Syncope due to nitrate vasodilatation has been reported. Flushing, drug rash, and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported in patients receiving nitrate therapy. Most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency greater than 2% are headache, dizziness and paresthesia.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.2) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "Patient Information Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or for more information, call Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism.

At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 \u2013 4% and 15 \u2013 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day for 13 days, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day for 11 days, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day for 13 days. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (less than 65 years) patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2.1 Recommended Dosage Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. 2.2 Priming The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17)]. The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use."

The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

    "overdosage": [
      "10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1 % solution), 1 \u2013 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean C maxand t maxwere 1,041 pg/ml and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12,769 pg/ml * min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues and for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2-and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials: Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, and SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Use of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) tubing in infusion sets may lead to loss of active ingredient due to adsorption of nitroglycerin to PVC tubing, therefore dosage is affected (see Dosage and Administration ). Nitroglycerin adsorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Relatively non-adsorptive intravenous administration sets are available. If intravenous nitroglycerin is administered through non-adsorptive tubing, doses based upon published reports will generally be too high. Some in-line intravenous filters also adsorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Solutions containing dextrose without electrolytes should not be administered through the same administration set as blood, as this may result in pseudoagglutination or hemolysis. The intravenous administration of solutions may cause fluid overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration and congested states of pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. Monitor patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Tolerance development and occurrence of cross tolerance to other nitro compounds have been reported. In industrial workers who have long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Administer nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection via an infusion pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection has not been studied. Monitor patients with known sub-clinical or overt diabetes mellitus when using solutions containing dextrose. Laboratory Tests: Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants) and may cause increased hypotensive effects.. Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications ). Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications ). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Nitroglycerin at higher dosages may interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Intravenous nitroglycerin can induce heparin resistance. Administration of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. Do not mix Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with any other medication of any kind. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, and no toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. However, the relationship between hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin and dose in the pediatric population have been documented in the literature. Studies in the literature used doses of nitroglycerin injection in pediatric patients ranging from 0.5 to 5 mcg/kg/min. The following equation can be used to calculate the flow rate in mL/hour of nitroglycerin using the 100 mcg/mL (25 mg/250 mL) concentration of nitroglycerin. Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/kg/min) x Weight (kg) x 60 min/h] Final Concentration (mcg/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a 2 kg child at a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [0.5 (mcg/kg/min) x 2 (kg) x 60 (min/h) ] = 0.6 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Example 2: for a 10 kg child at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/kg/min) x 10 (kg) x 60 (min/h) ] = 30 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Note: Very low infusion rates may require that a more dilute concentration of nitroglycerin infusion solution be prepared. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Do not use unless vacuum is present and solution is clear."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see Overdosage ). Dyspnea has also been reported. Data are not available to allow estimation of the frequency of adverse reactions during treatment with Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of overdose are generally similar to the described adverse reactions (see Adverse Reactions ). There is no specific antidote for overdose of nitroglycerin. The risk of overdose can be minimized by close monitoring during treatment. Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which -if any- of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u2265 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported with moderate doses of organic nitrates. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, discontinue treatment of nitroglycerin. If condition is not reversed, treat with methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. Administer Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection only via an infusion pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Do not use a container which has lost its vacuum, or one in which particulate matter is visible. Dosage is affected by the type of infusion set used (see Warnings ). Although the usual adult starting dose in published studies has been 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC tubing, so the delivered doses were less than those reported. When nonadsorptive tubing is used, doses must be reduced (see Warnings and Precautions ). The dosage must be determined by the patient\u2019s individual requirement and depending on the required response and possible adverse effects (see Adverse Reactions ). Even using nonadsorptive tubing, the dose necessary to achieve a given response will vary greatly from patient to patient. Patients with normal or low left-ventricular filling pressure ( e.g. , patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris) may respond fully to as little as 5 mcg/min, while other patients may require a dose that is one or even two orders of magnitude higher. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary in all patients receiving this medication; in many cases, invasive monitoring of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure will also be indicated. Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. The necessary flow rates to achieve various dose rates with the available concentrations are shown in the following table. Using nonadsorptive tubing, the initial adult dosage of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be 5 mcg/min. Subsequent titration must be guided by the clinical results, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments at intervals of 3 to 5 minutes. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and even 20 mcg/min can be used. Once some hemodynamic response is observed, dosage increments should be smaller and less frequent. When the concentration is changed, the tubing must be disconnected from the patient and flushed with the new solution before therapy is continued. If this precaution is not taken, then depending upon the tubing, pump, and flow rate used, it might be several hours before nitroglycerin is delivered at the desired rate. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not add supplementary medication to Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection. Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/min) x 60 min/h] Concentration (mcg/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a dose of 30 \u00b5g/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [30 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h) ] = 18 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Example 2: for a dose of 240 mcg/min using a 400 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h) ] = 36 (mL/h) 400 (mcg/mL)"

      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system is a flat unit designed to provide continuous controlled release of nitroglycerin through intact skin. The rate of release of nitroglycerin is linearly dependent upon the area of the applied system; each cm 2 of applied system delivers approximately 0.02 mg of nitroglycerin per hour. Thus, the 5-,10-, 15-, 20-, 30- and 40 cm 2 systems deliver approximately 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin per hour, respectively. The remainder of the nitroglycerin in each system serves as a reservoir and is not delivered in normal use. After 12 hours, for example, each system has delivered approximately 6% of its original content of nitroglycerin. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system contains nitroglycerin in acrylic-based polymer adhesives with a resinous cross-linking agent to provide a continuous source of active ingredient.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their antianginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (nonvasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10 to 12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. In healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin are reached by about 2 hours after application of a patch and are maintained for the duration of wearing the system (observations have been limited to 24 hours). Upon removal of the patch, the plasma concentration declines with a half-life of about an hour. Clinical Trials: Regimens in which nitroglycerin patches were worn for 12 hours daily have been studied in wellcontrolled trials up to 4 weeks in duration. Starting about 2 hours after application and continuing until 10 to 12 hours after application, patches that deliver at least 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin per hour have consistently demonstrated greater antianginal activity than placebo. Lower-dose patches have not been as well studied, but in one large, well-controlled trial in which higher-dose patches were also studied, patches delivering 0.2 mg/hr had significantly less antianginal activity than placebo. It is reasonable to believe that the rate of nitroglycerin absorption from patches may vary with the site of application, but this relationship has not been adequately studied."

Allergy to the adhesives used in nitroglycerin patches has also been reported, and it similarly constitutes a contraindication to the use of this product. Do not use nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system in patients who are taking phosphodiesterase inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for erectile dysfunction or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Concomitant use can cause severe drops in blood pressure. Do not use nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of the nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system patch by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, eg, sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this inter action have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia. A cardioverter/defibrillator should not be discharged through a paddle electrode that overlies a nitroglycerin patch. The arcing that may be seen in this situation is harmless in itself, but it may be associated with local current concentration that can cause damage to the paddles and burns to the patient."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin, particularly in the elderly. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system should therefore be used with caution in elderly patients who may be volume-depleted, are on multiple medications, or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to hypotension and may be at greater risk of falling at the therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly in the elderly. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated nitroglycerin regimens which incorporated a 10- to 12-hour, nitrate-free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate-free interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of transdermal nitroglycerin is unknown. Information for Patients: Daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with nitroglycerin, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. After normal use, there is enough residual nitroglycerin in discarded patches that they are a potential hazard to children and pets. A patient leaflet is supplied with the systems. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Concomitant use of nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with topically applied nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, po, or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin transdermal systems. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of nitroglycerin transdermal infusion systemm did not include sufficient information to determine whether subjects 65 years and older respond differently from younger subjects. Additional clinical data from the published literature indicate that the elderly demonstrate increased sensitivity to nitrates, which may result in hypotension and increased risk of falling. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of the decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose related, and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE ). Application-site irritation may occur but is rarely severe. In two placebo-controlled trials of intermittent therapy with nitroglycerin patches at 0.2 to 0.8 mg/hr, the most frequent adverse reactions among 307 subjects were as follows: Placebo Patch Headache 18% 63% Lightheadedness 4% 6% Hypotension, and/or Syncope 0% 4% Increased Angina 2% 2% To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact USpharma Ltd at 1(844)-750-3729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: Nitroglycerin toxicity is generally mild. The estimated adult oral lethal dose of nitroglycerin is 200 mg to 1,200 mg. Infants may be more susceptible to toxicity from nitroglycerin. Consultation with a poison center should be considered. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (eg, maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which \u2013 if any \u2013 of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant ( 3 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. Methemoglobinemia should be treated with methylene blue if the patient develops cardiac or CNS effects of hypoxia. The initial dose is 1 to 2 mg/kg infused intravenously over 5 minutes. Repeat methemoglobin levels should be obtained 30 minutes later and a repeat dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg may be used if the level remains elevated and the patient is still symptomatic. Relative contraindications for methylene blue include known NADH methemoglobin reductase deficiency or G-6-PD deficiency. Infants under the age of 4 months may not respond to methylene blue due to immature NADH methemoglobin reductase. Exchange transfusion has been used successfully in critically ill patients when methemoglobinemia is refractory to treatment."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The suggested starting dose is between 0.2 mg/hr* and 0.4 mg/hr*. Doses between 0.4 mg/hr* and 0.8 mg/hr* have shown continued effectiveness for 10 to 12 hours daily for at least 1 month (the longest period studied) of intermittent administration. Although the minimum nitrate-free interval has not been defined, data show that a nitrate-free interval of 10 to 12 hours is sufficient (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Thus, an appropriate dosing schedule for nitroglycerin patches would include a daily patch-on period of 12 to 14 hours and a daily patch-off period of 10 to 12 hours. *Release rates were formerly described in terms of drug delivered per 24 hours. In these terms, the supplied nitroglycerin transdermal system would be rated at 2.5 mg/24 hours (0.1 mg/hour), 5 mg/24 hours (0.2 mg/hour), 7.5 mg/24 hours (0.3 mg/hour), 10 mg/24 hours (0.4 mg/hour), and 15 mg/24 hours (0.6 mg/hour). Although some well-controlled clinical trials using exercise tolerance testing have shown maintenance of effectiveness when patches are worn continuously, the large majority of such controlled trials have shown the development of tolerance (ie, complete loss of effect) within the first 24 hours after therapy was initiated.

      "Please read this instruction on sheet carefully before using nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system Information for the Patient About\u2014 Nitroglycerin Transdermal Infusion System Summary The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system is a unique method of administering nitroglycerin to the bloodstream. Nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system eliminates the swallowing of pills or the application of a messy ointment. Nitroglycerin is a medication your doctor has prescribed for you to help reduce the frequency and severity of angina attacks (chest pain). How your nitroglycein transdermal infusion system works Nitroglycerin causes the veins (vessels that return blood to the heart) to relax so that the work load of the heart is reduced. This lowers the heart's oxygen needs. As a result, the heart muscle is well nourished and the frequency of angina attacks is reduced. Nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system is applied directly to the skin. The nitroglycerin passes from the adhesive surface through the skin\u2014allowing medication to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream. This manner of delivering medicine to your bloodstream provides you with nitroglycerin with one daily application of a nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system unit. Instructions for use Placement area Select a reasonably hair-free application site. Avoid extremities below the knee or elbow, skin folds, scar tissue, burned or irritated areas. Application Wash hands before applying. Hold the unit with brown lines facing you, in an up and down position. Bend the sides of unit away from you, then toward you until you hear the \"SNAP\". Peel off one side of the plastic backing. Using the other half of the backing as a handle, apply the sticky side of the patch to the skin. Press the sticky side on the skin, and smooth down. Fold back the remaining side of the patch. Grasp the edge of the plastic applicator by the stripe, and pull it across the skin. Wash hands to remove any drug. Removal Press down on the center of the system to raise its outer edge away from the skin. Grasp the edge gently, and slowly peel the unit away from skin. Wash skin area with soap and water. Towel dry. Wash hands. You may use a different application site every day. Skin care After you remove the nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system, your skin may feel warm and appear red. This is normal. The redness will disappear in a short time. If the area feels dry, you may apply a soothing lotion. Any redness or rash that does not disappear should be called to your doctor's attention. Cautions If your doctor has prescribed \"under-the-tongue\" nitroglycerin tablets in addition to the nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system, you should sit down before taking the \"under-the-tongue\" tablet. If dizziness should occur, notify your doctor. This may be an indication that the \"under-the-tongue\" tablet dosage needs to be reduced. Possible side effects The most common side effect experienced by people taking nitroglycerin is headache. Your doctor may tell you to take a mild analgesic to relieve the headache. Some people may experience dizziness. This is due to a slight decrease in blood pressure, which is usually experienced when a person changes position, from lying flat to sitting upright or from sitting to standing. If this occurs, sit down until the dizziness stops, then notify your doctor. He or she may wish to reduce your nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system dosage. In some people, nitroglycerin preparations may cause the skin to feel flushed or the heart to beat faster. If this should occur, notify your doctor; again, he or she may wish to change your nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system dosage. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system is a unique drug that depends on direct contact with the skin to work. For this reason, the skin should be reasonably hair-free, clean, and dry. Other information Allow nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system to stay in place as directed by your doctor. Showering is permitted with nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system in place. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system should be kept out of reach of children and pets. Store at room temperature 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system is boxed so that you have a 30-day supply. Be sure to check your supply periodically. Before it runs low, you should visit your pharmacist for a refill or ask your doctor to renew your nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system prescription. It is important that you do not miss a day of your nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system therapy. If your schedule needs to be changed, your doctor will give you special instructions. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system has been prescribed for you. Do not give your medication to anyone else. The nitroglycerin transdermal infusion system is for prevention of angina; not for treatment of an acute angina attack. Notify your doctor if angina attacks change for the worse. placement area image application figure image application figure image application figure image application figure image application figure image application figure image application figure image removal figure image removal figure image"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction of nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% applied to the anal canal is headache. Headache may be recurrent following each dose. Headaches are typically of short duration and can be treated with an analgesic, e.g. acetaminophen, and are reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. In Study REC-C-001, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a painful chronic anal fissure, the most frequent (\u2265 2%) adverse reactions reported were as follows (Table 1): Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions (\u2265 2%) in Study REC-C-001 Nitroglycerin Ointment N = 123 Placebo N = 124 System Organ Class Preferred term Patients n (%) Events n Patients n (%) Events n Nervous system disorders Headache 79 (64) 938 51 (41) 225 Dizziness 6 (5) 26 0 0 Most common adverse reactions are headache and dizziness.

Hypotension Transient episodes of light-headedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, also may occur. Hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) occurs infrequently, but in some patients may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Allergic Reactions Flushing, allergic reactions, and application site reactions (including drug rash and exfoliative dermatitis) have been reported rarely. Methemoglobinemia In rare cases, therapeutic doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia (see 10 OVERDOSAGE )."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS PDE5 inhibitors: potentiation of hypotensive effects of organic nitrates; concomitant use is contraindicated. ( 4.1 , 7.1 ) Antihypertensives: possible additive hypotensive effects. ( 7.2 ) Aspirin: increased nitroglycerin levels. ( 7.3 ) Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA): decreased thrombolytic effect. ( 7.4 ) Heparin: anticoagulant effect of heparin may be reduced. Monitor APTT. ( 7.5 ) Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. ( 7.6 ) Alcohol: Additive vasodilatory effects to nitroglycerin. Consumption of alcohol should be avoided. ( 7.7 ) 7.1 PDE5 Inhibitors Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. The time course of the interaction appears to be related to the half-life of the PDE5 inhibitor, however, the dose dependence of this interaction has not been studied. Use of nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% within a few days of PDE5 inhibitors is contraindicated. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and other nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects when using nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4%. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Aspirin Coadministration of aspirin (at doses between 500 mg and 1000 mg) and nitroglycerin has been reported to result in increased nitroglycerin maximum concentrations by as much as 67% and AUC by 73% when administered as a single dose. The pharmacological effects of nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. 7.4 Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Plasma levels of t-PA are reduced when coadministered with nitroglycerin. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% during t-PA therapy. 7.5 Heparin Although an interaction has been reported between intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin (resulting in a decrease in the anticoagulant effect of heparin), the data are not consistent. If patients are to receive intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% concurrently, the anticoagulation status of the patient must be checked. 7.6 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and consequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore the possibility of ergotism in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% should be considered. 7.7 Alcohol The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin have been shown to be additive to the effects observed with alcohol."

Nitroglycerin was not teratogenic when administered by topical or dietary route. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. A teratogenicity study was conducted in rats with nitroglycerin administered in the diet at levels up to 1% content (approximately 430 mg/kg/day) on days 6 to 15 of gestation. In offspring of the high-dose group, an increased but not statistically significant incidence of diaphragmatic hernias was noted together with decreased hyoid bone ossification. The latter finding probably reflects delayed development, thus indicating no clear evidence of a potential teratogenic effect of nitroglycerin. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin ointment, 0.4% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Clinical data from the published literature indicate that the elderly demonstrate increased sensitivity to nitrates, which may be therapeutic but also manifest by more frequent or severe hypotension and related dizziness or fainting. Increased sensitivity may reflect the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Nitroglycerin toxicity is generally mild. The estimated adult oral lethal dose of nitroglycerin is 200 mg to 1,200 mg. Infants may be more susceptible to toxicity from nitroglycerin. Consultation with a poison center should be considered. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which if any of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is not recommended. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin ointment overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate arterial PO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Intra-anal application of nitroglycerin reduces sphincter tone and resting intra-anal pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: Nitroglycerin is metabolized by a liver reductase enzyme to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, the two major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols are found in plasma. The contribution of metabolites to the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is unknown. The dinitrates are further metabolized to nonvasoactive mononitrates and ultimately to glycerol and carbon dioxide. Elimination: Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly with a mean elimination half-life of two to three minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg.

Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At the highest dose, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was 52% compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidence of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay with Salmonella typhimurium . A similar mutation in this S. typhimurium was also reported with other NO donors. There was no evidence of clastogenic potential in multiple assays including a rodent dominant lethal assay, an in vitro Chinese Hamster Ovary assay that was conducted in the absence of metabolic activation, and several in vivo chromosomal aberration assays conducted in rats and dogs. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to approximately 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology The principal pharmacological action of Nitroglycerin Injection is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials : Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, AND SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

      "Indications and Usage Nitroglycerin Injection is indicated for treatment of peri-operative hypertension; for control of congestive heart failure in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; for treatment of angina pectoris in patients who have not responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and b-blockers; and for induction of intraoperative hypotension."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "Contraindications Allergic reactions to organic nitrates are extremely rare, but they do occur. Nitroglycerin Injection is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. In patients with pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis, cardiac output is dependent upon venous return. Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Warnings Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with volume expansion. Nitroglycerin readily migrates into many plastics, including the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics commonly used for intravenous administration sets. Nitroglycerin absorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Some in-line intravenous filters also absorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Because of the problem of nitroglycerin absorption by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing, Nitroglycerin Injection should be used with the least absorptive infusion tubing (i.e., non-PVC tubing) available. DOSING INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED WITH CARE. WHEN THE APPROPRIATE INFUSION SETS ARE USED, THE CALCULATED DOSE WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT, BECAUSE THE LOSS OF NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SEEN WITH STANDARD PVC TUBING WILL BE AVOIDED. THE DOSAGES REPORTED IN PUBLISHED STUDIES UTILIZED GENERAL-USE PVC ADMINISTRATION SETS, AND RECOMMENDED DOSES BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE WILL BE TOO HIGH WHEN THE LOW-ABSORBING INFUSION SETS ARE USED."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General : Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24- hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of nitroglycerin increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Nitroglycerin infusions should be administered only via a pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin infusions has not been studied. Laboratory Tests : Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions : The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Administration of nitroglycerin infusions through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. More generally, nitroglycerin in 5% dextrose or sodium chloride 0.9% should not be mixed with any other medication of any kind. Intravenous nitroglycerin interferes, at least in some patients, with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. In patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, concomitant heparin therapy should be guided by frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility : Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy : Pregnancy Category C: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mother s: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE)."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "Overdosage Hemodynamic Effects : The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitation; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which- if any-of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemi a : Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u00b310%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

      "Dosage and Administration NOT FOR DIRECT INTRAVENOUS INJECTION NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION IS A CONCENTRATED, POTENT DRUG WHICH MUST BE DILUTED IN DEXTROSE (5%) INJECTION OR SODIUM CHLORIDE (0.9%) INJECTION PRIOR TO ITS INFUSION. NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS. 1. Initial Dilution : Aseptically transfer the contents of one nitroglycerin vial (containing 25 mg or 50 mg of nitroglycerin) into a 500 mL glass bottle of either Dextrose (5%) Injection or Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%). This yields a final concentration of 50 mcg/mL or 100 mcg/mL. Diluting 5 mg nitroglycerin into 100 mL will also yield a final concentration of 50 mcg/mL. 2. Maintenance Dilution: It is important to consider the fluid requirements of the patient as well as the expected duration of infusion in selecting the appropriate dilution of Nitroglycerin Injection. After the initial dosage titration, the concentration of the solution may be increased, if necessary, to limit fluids given to the patient. The nitroglycerin concentration should not exceed 400 mcg/mL. See chart. Note: If the concentration is adjusted, it is imperative to flush or replace the infusion set before a new concentration is utilized. If the set were not flushed or replaced, it could take minutes to hours, depending upon the flow rate and the dead space of the set, for the new concentration to reach the patient. Invert the glass parenteral bottle several times to assure uniform dilution of the nitroglycerin. Dosage is affected by the type of container and administration set used. See WARNINGS. Although the usual starting adult dose range reported in clinical studies was 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC administration sets. THE USE OF NON-ABSORBING TUBING WILL RESULT IN THE NEED FOR REDUCED DOSES. If a peristaltic action infusion pump is used, an appropriate administration set should be selected with a drip chamber that delivers approximately 60 microdrops/mL. Table 1 and the Nitroglycerin Injection Dilution Table below may be used to calculate the nitroglycerin dilution and flow rate in microdrops/minute to achieve the desired Nitroglycerin Injection administration rate. If a volumetric infusion pump is used, an appropriate volumetric infusion pump connector set should be selected. Table 1 below may still be used; however, flow rate will be determined directly by the infusion pump, independent of the drop size of the appropriate set drip chambers. Thus, the reference to ``microdrops/min## is not applicable, and the corresponding flow rate in mL/hr should be used to determine pump settings. When using a non-absorbing infusion set, the initial dosage should be 5 mcg/min delivered through an infusion pump capable of exact and constant delivery of the drug. Subsequent titration must be adjusted to the clinical situation, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments, with increases every 3-5 minutes until some response is noted. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and later 20 mcg/min can be used. Once a partial blood pressure response is observed, the dose increase should be reduced and the interval between increases should be lengthened. Some patients with normal or low left ventricular filling pressures or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (e.g., angina patients without other complications) may be hypersensitive to the effects of nitroglycerin and may respond fully to doses as small as 5 mcg/ min. These patients require especially careful titration and monitoring. There is no fixed optimum dose of nitroglycerin. Due to variations in the responsiveness of individual patients to the drug, each patient must be titrated to the desired level of hemodynamic function. Therefore, continuous monitoring of physiologic parameters (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate in all patients, other measurements such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as appropriate) MUST be performed to achieve the correct dose. Adequate systemic blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure must be maintained. Dilution: Nitroglycerin Injection is supplied in 5 mg/mL solution.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration- time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Parameter Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2\u00ad and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males.

      "Nitroglycerin (nye\" troe glis' er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablet may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1\u20132 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism.

At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Mechanism of Action: Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. Pharmacodynamics: Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption: Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution: The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination: Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are indicated for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Sublingual nitroglycerin therapy is contraindicated in patients with early myocardial infarction, severe anemia, increased intracranial pressure, and those with a known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin. Administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride) since these compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The benefits of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed. Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens that incorporated a 10- to 12-hour nitrate free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. Nitrate tolerance as a result of sublingual nitroglycerin administration is probably possible, but only in patients who maintain high continuous nitrate levels for more than 10 or 12 hours daily. Such use of sublingual nitroglycerin would entail administration of scores of tablets daily and is not recommended. The drug should be discontinued if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches. Information for Patients Nitroglycerin is a sublingual tablet and should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. If possible, patients should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and should use caution when returning to a standing position. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. Nitroglycerin may produce a burning or tingling sensation when administered sublingually; however, the ability to produce a burning or tingling sensation should not be considered a reliable method for determining the potency of the tablets. Headaches can sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness upon standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Nitroglycerin should be kept in the original glass container and must be tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Drug Interactions Concomitant use of nitroglycerin with soluble guanylate cyclasestimulators is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of alteplase. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin during alteplase therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Nitrates may interfere with the Zlatkis-Zak color reaction, causing a false report of decreased serum cholesterol. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Category B . Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. However, teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at dosages up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively revealed no toxic effects on dams or fetuses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin\u2019s capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; tachycardia; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported in association with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

      "PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablet is right for you. What is nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets) . You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medications to treat depression or psychiatric illness. You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking the blood thinner medicine heparin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute, period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Mechanism of Action: Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. Pharmacodynamics: Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption: Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution: The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination: Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Sublingual nitroglycerin therapy is contraindicated in patients with early myocardial infarction, severe anemia, increased intracranial pressure, and those with a known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin. Administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride) since these compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The benefits of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed. Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens that incorporated a 10- to 12-hour nitrate free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. Nitrate tolerance as a result of sublingual nitroglycerin administration is probably possible, but only in patients who maintain high continuous nitrate levels for more than 10 or 12 hours daily. Such use of sublingual nitroglycerin would entail administration of scores of tablets daily and is not recommended. The drug should be discontinued if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches. Information for Patients Nitroglycerin is a sublingual tablet and should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. If possible, patients should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and should use caution when returning to a standing position. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. Nitroglycerin may produce a burning or tingling sensation when administered sublingually; however, the ability to produce a burning or tingling sensation should not be considered a reliable method for determining the potency of the tablets. Headaches can sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness upon standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Nitroglycerin should be kept in the original glass container and must be tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Drug Interactions Concomitant use of nitroglycerin with soluble guanylate cyclasestimulators is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of alteplase. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin during alteplase therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Nitrates may interfere with the Zlatkis-Zak color reaction, causing a false report of decreased serum cholesterol. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Category B. Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. However, teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at dosages up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively revealed no toxic effects on dams or fetuses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; tachycardia; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported in association with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. During administration the patient should rest, preferably in the sitting position. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal failure."

      "PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablet is right for you. What is nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets) . You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: 1. very recent heart attack 2. severe anemia 3. increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: 1. You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. 2. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. 3. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). 4. You are taking medications to treat depression or psychiatric illness. 5. You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. 6. You are taking aspirin. 7. You are taking the blood thinner medicine heparin. 8. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. 9. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. 10. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? 1. Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. 2. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. 3. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. 4. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. 5. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute, period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. 6. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. 7. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? 1. Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. 2. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. 3. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin may cause the following side effects: 1. headache 2. vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) 3. dizziness 4. weakness 5. heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) 6. low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position 7. nausea and vomiting 8. sweating 9. paleness 10. fainting 11. flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) 12. other skin reactions that may be severe Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause a false test result of decreased serum cholesterol. Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at 20\u00b0-25\u00b0C (68\u00b0-77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or call Dr. Reddy\u2019s Medical Information Department, at 1-888-375-3784.

    ],
    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is whose empiric formula is C3H5N3O9, and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. Dextrose (Dextrose Hydrous, USP) is D-glucose monohydrate, a hexose sugar whose structural formula is whose empiric formula is C6H12O6 \u2022 H2O, and whose molecular weight is 198.17. Dextrose is derived from corn. Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of nitroglycerin and dextrose in water for injection. The solution is clear and practically colorless. Each 100 mL contains 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg nitroglycerin (added as Diluted Nitroglycerin, USP with propylene glycol); 5 g Dextrose Hydrous, USP; 0.84 mL Alcohol, USP (added as a dissolution aid); and 105 mg Citric Acid Hydrous, USP (added as a buffer). The pH of the solution is adjusted with sodium hydroxide and, if necessary, hydrochloric acid. Although dry nitroglycerin is explosive, nitroglycerin in 5% dextrose is not. Composition, osmolarity and pH are given in Table 1. * Normal physiologic osmolarity range is approximately 280 to 310 mOsmol/L. Administration of substantially hypertonic solutions (\u2265600 mOsmol/L) may cause vein damage. STRUCTURE 1 STRUCTURE 2 DESCRIPTION"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2-and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials: Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, and SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated for treatment of peri-operative hypertension; for control of heart failure in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; for treatment of angina pectoris in patients who have not responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and \u00df-blockers; and for induction of intraoperative hypotension."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. In patients with pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis, cardiac output is dependent upon venous return. Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions. Nitroglycerin is also contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Do not use Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors) such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Use of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) tubing in infusion sets may lead to loss of active ingredient due to adsorption of nitroglycerin to PVC tubing, therefore dosage is affected (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION ). Nitroglycerin adsorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Relatively non-adsorptive intravenous administration sets are available. If intravenous nitroglycerin is administered through non-adsorptive tubing, doses based upon published reports will generally be too high. Some in-line intravenous filters also adsorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Solutions containing dextrose without electrolytes should not be administered through the same administration set as blood, as this may result in pseudoagglutination or hemolysis. The intravenous administration of solutions may cause fluid overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration and congested states of pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. Monitor patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Tolerance development and occurrence of cross tolerance to other nitro compounds have been reported. In industrial workers who have long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Administer nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection via an infusion pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection has not been studied. Monitor patients with known sub-clinical or overt diabetes mellitus when using solutions containing dextrose. Laboratory Tests: Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants) and may cause increased hypotensive effects.. Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Nitroglycerin at higher dosages may interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Intravenous nitroglycerin can induce heparin resistance. Administration of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. Do not mix Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with any other medication of any kind. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, and no toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. However, the relationship between hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin and dose in the pediatric population have been documented in the literature. Studies in the literature used doses of nitroglycerin injection in pediatric patients ranging from 0.5 to 5 mcg/kg/min. The following equation can be used to calculate the flow rate in mL/hour of nitroglycerin using the 100 mcg/mL (25 mg/250 mL) concentration of nitroglycerin. Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/kg/min) x Weight (kg) x 60 min/h] Final Concentration (mcg/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a 2 kg child at a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [0.5 (mcg/kg/min) x 2 (kg) x 60 (min/h)] = 0.6 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Example 2: for a 10 kg child at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/kg/min) x 10 (kg) x 60 (min/h)] = 30 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Note: Very low infusion rates may require that a more dilute concentration of nitroglycerin infusion solution be prepared. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Do not use unless vacuum is present and solution is clear."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dyspnea has also been reported. Data are not available to allow estimation of the frequency of adverse reactions during treatment with Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of overdose are generally similar to the described adverse reactions (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). There is no specific antidote for overdose of nitroglycerin. The risk of overdose can be minimized by close monitoring during treatment. Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which -if any- of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u2265 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported with moderate doses of organic nitrates. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, discontinue treatment of nitroglycerin. If condition is not reversed, treat with methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. Administer Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection only via an infusion pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Do not use a container which has lost its vacuum, or one in which particulate matter is visible. Dosage is affected by the type of infusion set used (see WARNINGS ). Although the usual adult starting dose in published studies has been 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC tubing, so the delivered doses were less than those reported. When nonadsorptive tubing is used, doses must be reduced (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The dosage must be determined by the patient\u2019s individual requirement and depending on the required response and possible adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Even using nonadsorptive tubing, the dose necessary to achieve a given response will vary greatly from patient to patient. Patients with normal or low left-ventricular filling pressure (e.g., patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris) may respond fully to as little as 5 mcg/min, while other patients may require a dose that is one or even two orders of magnitude higher. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary in all patients receiving this medication; in many cases, invasive monitoring of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure will also be indicated. Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. The necessary flow rates to achieve various dose rates with the available concentrations are shown in the following table. Using nonadsorptive tubing, the initial adult dosage of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be 5 mcg/min. Subsequent titration must be guided by the clinical results, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments at intervals of 3 to 5 minutes. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and even 20 mcg/min can be used. Once some hemodynamic response is observed, dosage increments should be smaller and less frequent. When the concentration is changed, the tubing must be disconnected from the patient and flushed with the new solution before therapy is continued. If this precaution is not taken, then depending upon the tubing, pump, and flow rate used, it might be several hours before nitroglycerin is delivered at the desired rate. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact. Do not add supplementary medication to Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection. Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/min) x 60 min/h] Concentration (mcg/mL) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows: Example 1: for a dose of 30 \u00b5g/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [30 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h)] = 18 (mL/h) 100 (mcg/mL) Example 2: for a dose of 240 mcg/min using a 400 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows: Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h)] = 36 (mL/h) 400 (mcg/mL)"

The most common adverse reaction of nitroglycerin ointment applied to the anal canal is headache. Headache may be recurrent following each dose. Headaches are typically of short duration and can be treated with an analgesic, e.g. acetaminophen, and are reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. In Study REC-C-001, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a painful chronic anal fissure, the most frequent ( > 2%) adverse reactions reported were as follows (Table 1) Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions ( > 2%) in Study REC-C-001 Nitroglycerin Ointment N = 123 Placebo N = 124 System Organ Class Preferred term Patients n (%) Events n Patients n (%) Events n Nervous system disorders Headache 79 (64) 938 51 (41) 225 Dizziness 6 (5) 26 0 0 Hypotension Transient episodes of light-headedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, also may occur. Hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) occurs infrequently, but in some patients may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Allergic Reactions Flushing, allergic reactions, and application site reactions (including drug rash and exfoliative dermatitis) have been reported rarely. Methemoglobinemia In rare cases, therapeutic doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia [see OVERDOSAGE (10) ]. Most common adverse reactions are headache and dizziness.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 PDE5 inhibitors: potentiation of hypotensive effects of organic nitrates; concomitant use is contraindicated. ( 4.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Antihypertensives: possible additive hypotensive effects. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Aspirin: increased nitroglycerin levels. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA): decreased thrombolytic effect. ( 7.4 ) \u2022 Heparin: anticoagulant effect of heparin may be reduced. Monitor APTT. ( 7.5 ) \u2022 Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. ( 7.6 ) \u2022 Alcohol: Additive vasodilatory effects to nitroglycerin. Consumption of alcohol should be avoided. ( 7.7 ) 7.1 PDE5 inhibitors Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. The time course of the interaction appears to be related to the half-life of the PDE5 inhibitor, however, the dose dependence of this interaction has not been studied. Use of nitroglycerin ointment within a few days of PDE5 inhibitors is contraindicated. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and other nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects when using nitroglycerin ointment Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin ointment in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Aspirin Coadministration of aspirin (at doses between 500 mg and 1000 mg) and nitroglycerin has been reported to result in increased nitroglycerin maximum concentrations by as much as 67% and AUC by 73% when administered as a single dose. The pharmacological effects of nitroglycerin ointment may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. 7.4 Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Plasma levels of t-PA are reduced when coadministered with nitroglycerin. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment during t-PA therapy. 7.5 Heparin Although an interaction has been reported between intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin (resulting in a decrease in the anticoagulant effect of heparin), the data are not consistent. If patients are to receive intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin ointment concurrently, the anticoagulation status of the patient must be checked. 7.6 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and consequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore the possibility of ergotism in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment should be considered. 7.7 Alcohol The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin have been shown to be additive to the effects observed with alcohol."

In animal reproduction studies, no malformations were observed in offspring of pregnant rats and rabbits administered nitroglycerin by topical or dietary route during the period of organogenesis ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. An animal reproduction study was conducted in rats with nitroglycerin administered in the diet at levels up to 1% content (approximately 430 mg/kg/day) on days 6 to 15 of gestation. In offspring of the high-dose group, an increased but not statistically significant incidence of diaphragmatic hernias was noted together with decreased hyoid bone ossification. The latter finding probably reflects delayed development, thus indicating no clear evidence of a potential teratogenic effect of nitroglycerin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of nitroglycerin in either human or animal milk following topical administration, or the effects of nitroglycerin on milk production. A publication describing 40 lactating patients who used nitroglycerin ointment to treat chronic anal fissures for varied durations did not report signs of adverse effects in their breastfed infants, however, the dosing regimens were not described. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the clinical need for nitroglycerin ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from nitroglycerin ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin ointment in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin ointment did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Clinical data from the published literature indicate that the elderly demonstrate increased sensitivity to nitrates, which may be therapeutic but also manifest by more frequent or severe hypotension and related dizziness or fainting. Increased sensitivity may reflect the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Nitroglycerin toxicity is generally mild. The estimated adult oral lethal dose of nitroglycerin is 200 mg to 1,200 mg. Infants may be more susceptible to toxicity from nitroglycerin. Consultation with a poison center should be considered. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is not recommended. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin ointment overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate arterial PO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'- monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Intra- anal application of nitroglycerin reduces sphincter tone and resting intra-anal pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: Nitroglycerin is metabolized by a liver reductase enzyme to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate.

This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: Nitroglycerin is metabolized by a liver reductase enzyme to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, the two major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols are found in plasma.

Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At the highest dose, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was 52% compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidence of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Mutagenesis Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay with Salmonella typhimurium. A similar mutation in this S. typhimurium was also reported with other NO donors.There was no evidence of clastogenic potential in multiple assays including a rodent dominant lethal assay, an in vitro Chinese Hamster Ovary assay that was conducted in the absence of metabolic activation, and several in vivo chromosomal aberration assays conducted in rats and dogs. Impairment of Fertility In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to approximately 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males."

      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. NITRO-BID\u00ae for topical use contains lactose and 2% nitroglycerin in a base of lanolin, white petrolatum and purified water. Each inch (2.5 cm), as squeezed from the tube, contains approximately 15 mg of nitroglycerin. STRUCTURE"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about three minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10 - 12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Reliable assay techniques for plasma nitroglycerin levels have only recently become available, and studies using these techniques to define the pharmacokinetics of nitroglycerin ointment have not been reported. Published studies using older techniques provide results that often differ, in similar experimental settings, by an order of magnitude. The data are consistent, however, in suggesting that nitroglycerin levels rise to steady state within an hour or so of application of ointment, and that after removal of nitroglycerin ointment, levels wane with a half-life of about half an hour. The onset of action of transdermal nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode. The maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal activity provided by nitroglycerin ointment therapy has not been studied. Recent studies of other formulations of nitroglycerin suggest that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from nitroglycerin ointment will be about 12 hours. It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied. Clinical Trials: Controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin. In some controlled trials of other organic nitrate formulations, efficacy has declined with time. Because controlled, long-term trials of nitroglycerin ointment have not been reported, it is not known how the efficacy of nitroglycerin ointment may vary during extended therapy."

If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pains, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of transdermal nitroglycerin is not known. Information for Patients: Daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with nitroglycerin, since loss of headache is likely to be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Patient instruction leaflet is included. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of nitroglycerin have not been performed. Nitroglycerin's effect upon reproductive capacity is similarly unknown. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin. It is also not known whether nitroglycerin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related, and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients; for further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment see OVERDOSAGE . Data are not available to allow estimation of the frequency of adverse reactions during treatment with nitroglycerin ointment."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which\u2014if any\u2014of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or the arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u2265 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION As noted above ( CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) , controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin. It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied. Controlled trials with other formulations of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that if plasma levels are maintained continuously, all anti-anginal efficacy is lost within 24 hours. This tolerance cannot be overcome by increasing the dose of nitroglycerin. As a result, any regimen of NITRO-BID\u00ae administration should include a daily nitrate-free interval. The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10 to 12 hours is sufficient. Thus, one appropriate dosing schedule for NITRO-BID\u00ae would begin with two daily 1/2- inch (7.5 mg) doses, one applied on rising in the morning and one applied six hours later. The dose could be doubled, and even doubled again, in patients tolerating this dose but failing to respond to it. The foilpac is intended as a unit dose package only and is equivalent to approximately 1 inch as squeezed from the tube. Use entire contents of foilpac to obtain full dose and discard immediately after use. Each tube of ointment and each box of foilpacs is supplied with a pad of ruled, impermeable, paper applicators. These applicators allow ointment to be absorbed through a much smaller area of skin than that used in any of the reported clinical trials, and the significance of this difference is not known. To apply the ointment using one of the applicators, place the applicator on a flat surface, printed side down. Squeeze the necessary amount of ointment from the tube onto the applicator, place the applicator (ointment side down) on the desired area of the skin, and tape the applicator into place."

One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Distributed by: Sportpharm 2237 N Commerce Parkway, STE 1, Weston, Florida-33326 Relabeled and Repackaged by: Enovachem PHARMACEUTICALS Torrance, CA 90501 PATIENT INFORMATION Nitroglycerin (nye\u201d troe glis\u2019 er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or you can call NATCO Pharma USA LLC at 201-786-6500.

PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Parameter Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "Nitroglycerin (nahy- truh -glis-er-in) Sublingual Tablets Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency.

(5.2) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.2) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "Patient Information Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or for more information, call Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337.

One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism.

At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index.

Product of USA Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 PATIENT INFORMATION Nitroglycerin (nye\u201d troe glis\u2019 er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, or you can call DASH Pharmaceuticals LLC at 201-786-6500.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of Nitroglycerin Injection is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials: Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, AND SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Allergic reactions to organic nitrates are extremely rare, but they do occur. Nitroglycerin Injection is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. In patients with pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis, cardiac output is dependent upon venous return. Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with volume expansion. Nitroglycerin readily migrates into many plastics, including the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics commonly used for intravenous administration sets. Nitroglycerin absorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Some in-line intravenous filters also absorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Because of the problem of nitroglycerin absorption by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing, Nitroglycerin Injection should be used with the least absorptive infusion tubing (i.e., non-PVC tubing) available. DOSING INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED WITH CARE. WHEN THE APPROPRIATE INFUSION SETS ARE USED, THE CALCULATED DOSE WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT, BECAUSE THE LOSS OF NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SEEN WITH STANDARD PVC TUBING WILL BE AVOIDED. THE DOSAGES REPORTED IN PUBLISHED STUDIES UTILIZED GENERAL-USE PVC ADMINISTRATION SETS, AND RECOMMENDED DOSES BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE WILL BE TOO HIGH WHEN THE LOW-ABSORBING INFUSION SETS ARE USED."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24- hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of nitroglycerin increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Nitroglycerin infusions should be administered only via a pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin infusions has not been studied. Laboratory Tests: Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Administration of nitroglycerin infusions through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. More generally, nitroglycerin in 5% dextrose or sodium chloride 0.9% should not be mixed with any other medication of any kind. Intravenous nitroglycerin interferes, at least in some patients, with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. In patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, concomitant heparin therapy should be guided by frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high doses, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitation; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which-if any-of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u226510%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR DIRECT INTRAVENOUS INJECTION NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION IS A CONCENTRATED, POTENT DRUG WHICH MUST BE DILUTED IN DEXTROSE (5%) INJECTION OR SODIUM CHLORIDE (0.9%) INJECTION PRIOR TO ITS INFUSION. NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS. Initial Dilution: Aseptically transfer the contents of one nitroglycerin vial (50 mg of nitroglycerin) into a 500 mL glass bottle of either Dextrose (5%) Injection or Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%). This yields a final concentration of 100 mcg/mL. Diluting 5 mg nitroglycerin into 100 mL will yield a final concentration of 50 mcg/mL. Maintenance Dilution: It is important to consider the fluid requirements of the patient as well as the expected duration of infusion in selecting the appropriate dilution of Nitroglycerin Injection. After the initial dosage titration, the concentration of the solution may be increased, if necessary, to limit fluids given to the patient. The nitroglycerin concentration should not exceed 400 mcg/mL. See chart. Note: If the concentration is adjusted, it is imperative to flush or replace the infusion set before a new concentration is utilized. If the set were not flushed or replaced, it could take minutes to hours, depending upon the flow rate and the dead space of the set, for the new concentration to reach the patient. Invert the glass parenteral bottle several times to assure uniform dilution of the nitroglycerin. Dosage is affected by the type of container and administration set used. See WARNINGS . Although the usual starting adult dose range reported in clinical studies was 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC administration sets. THE USE OF NON-ABSORBING TUBING WILL RESULT IN THE NEED FOR REDUCED DOSES. If a peristaltic action infusion pump is used, an appropriate administration set should be selected with a drip chamber that delivers approximately 60 microdrops/mL. Table 1 and the Nitroglycerin Injection Dilution Table below may be used to calculate the nitroglycerin dilution and flow rate in microdrops/minute to achieve the desired Nitroglycerin Injection administration rate. If a volumetric infusion pump is used, an appropriate volumetric infusion pump connector set should be selected. Table 1 below may still be used; however, flow rate will be determined directly by the infusion pump, independent of the drop size of the appropriate set drip chambers. Thus, the reference to ``microdrops/min\u2032\u2032 is not applicable, and the corresponding flow rate in mL/hr should be used to determine pump settings. When using a non-absorbing infusion set, the initial dosage should be 5 mcg/min delivered through an infusion pump capable of exact and constant delivery of the drug. Subsequent titration must be adjusted to the clinical situation, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments, with increases every 3-5 minutes until some response is noted. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and later 20 mcg/min can be used. Once a partial blood pressure response is observed, the dose increase should be reduced and the interval between increases should be lengthened. Some patients with normal or low left ventricular filling pressures or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (e.g., angina patients without other complications) may be hypersensitive to the effects of nitroglycerin and may respond fully to doses as small as 5 mcg/min. These patients require especially careful titration and monitoring. There is no fixed optimum dose of nitroglycerin. Due to variations in the responsiveness of individual patients to the drug, each patient must be titrated to the desired level of hemodynamic function. Therefore, continuous monitoring of physiologic parameters (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate in all patients, other measurements such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as appropriate) MUST be performed to achieve the correct dose. Adequate systemic blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure must be maintained. Dilution: Nitroglycerin Injection is supplied in 5 mg/mL solution.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer one tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period. ( 2 ) If chest pain persists after three tablets, seek prompt medical attention.

( 4.1 , 7.1 ) Severe anemia ( 4.2 ) Increased intracranial pressure ( 4.3 ) Hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin sublingual tablets or to other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient ( 4.4 ) Circulatory failure and shock ( 4.5 ) 4.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking PDE-5 Inhibitors, such as avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. 4.2 Severe Anemia Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe anemia (large doses of nitroglycerin may cause oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin and could exacerbate anemia). 4.3 Increased Intracranial Pressure Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may precipitate or aggravate increased intracranial pressure and thus should not be used in patients with possible increased intracranial pressure (e.g., cerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury). 4.4 Hypersensitivity Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to nitroglycerin, other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient. 4.5 Circulatory Failure and Shock Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute circulatory failure or shock."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail elsewhere in the label: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.4)] Vertigo, dizziness, weakness, palpitation, and other manifestations of postural hypotension may develop occasionally, particularly in erect, immobile patients. Marked sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of nitrates (manifested by nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis, pallor, and collapse) may occur at therapeutic doses. Syncope due to nitrate vasodilatation has been reported. Flushing, drug rash, and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported in patients receiving nitrate therapy. Most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency greater than 2% are headache, dizziness and paresthesia.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males.

Product of USA Manufactured by: NATCO PHARMA LIMITED Kothur- 509 228, Telangana, India Manufactured for: NATCO Pharma USA LLC, Parsippany, NJ 07054, USA Revised: 07/2023 PATIENT INFORMATION Nitroglycerin (nye\u201d troe glis\u2019 er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or you can call NATCO Pharma USA LLC at 201-786-6500.

      "PRECAUTIONS General: Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24- hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of nitroglycerin increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Nitroglycerin infusions should be administered only via a pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin infusions has not been studied. Laboratory Tests: Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Administration of nitroglycerin infusions through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. More generally, nitroglycerin in 5% dextrose or sodium chloride 0.9% should not be mixed with any other medication of any kind. Intravenous nitroglycerin interferes, at least in some patients, with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. In patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, concomitant heparin therapy should be guided by frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high doses, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: whose empiric formula is C3H5N3O9, and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. Nitroglycerin Injection, USP is a clear, practically colorless additive solution for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each mL contains: Nitroglycerin 5 mg, Alcohol 30% (v/v), Propylene Glycol 30%, and Water for Injection q.s. pH (range 3.0 to 6.5) may have been adjusted with Sodium Hydroxide and/or Hydrochloric Acid. The solution is sterile, non-pyrogenic, and nonexplosive. STRUCTURE"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of Nitroglycerin Injection is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials: Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, AND SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Nitroglycerin Injection is indicated for treatment of peri-operative hypertension; for control of congestive heart failure in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; for treatment of angina pectoris in patients who have not responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and \u03b2-blockers; and for induction of intraoperative hypotension."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Allergic reactions to organic nitrates are extremely rare, but they do occur. Nitroglycerin Injection is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. In patients with pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis, cardiac output is dependent upon venous return. Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with volume expansion. Nitroglycerin readily migrates into many plastics, including the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics commonly used for intravenous administration sets. Nitroglycerin absorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Some in-line intravenous filters also absorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Because of the problem of nitroglycerin absorption by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing, Nitroglycerin Injection should be used with the least absorptive infusion tubing (i.e., non-PVC tubing) available. DOSING INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED WITH CARE. WHEN THE APPROPRIATE INFUSION SETS ARE USED, THE CALCULATED DOSE WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT, BECAUSE THE LOSS OF NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SEEN WITH STANDARD PVC TUBING WILL BE AVOIDED. THE DOSAGES REPORTED IN PUBLISHED STUDIES UTILIZED GENERAL-USE PVC ADMINISTRATION SETS, AND RECOMMENDED DOSES BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE WILL BE TOO HIGH WHEN THE LOW-ABSORBING INFUSION SETS ARE USED."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitation; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which-if any-of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u226510%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR DIRECT INTRAVENOUS INJECTION NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION IS A CONCENTRATED, POTENT DRUG WHICH MUST BE DILUTED IN DEXTROSE (5%) INJECTION OR SODIUM CHLORIDE (0.9%) INJECTION PRIOR TO ITS INFUSION. NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS. Initial Dilution: Aseptically transfer the contents of one nitroglycerin vial (50 mg of nitroglycerin) into a 500 mL glass bottle of either Dextrose (5%) Injection or Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%). This yields a final concentration of 100 mcg/mL. Diluting 5 mg nitroglycerin into 100 mL will yield a final concentration of 50 mcg/mL. Maintenance Dilution: It is important to consider the fluid requirements of the patient as well as the expected duration of infusion in selecting the appropriate dilution of Nitroglycerin Injection. After the initial dosage titration, the concentration of the solution may be increased, if necessary, to limit fluids given to the patient. The nitroglycerin concentration should not exceed 400 mcg/mL. See chart. Note: If the concentration is adjusted, it is imperative to flush or replace the infusion set before a new concentration is utilized. If the set were not flushed or replaced, it could take minutes to hours, depending upon the flow rate and the dead space of the set, for the new concentration to reach the patient. Invert the glass parenteral bottle several times to assure uniform dilution of the nitroglycerin. Dosage is affected by the type of container and administration set used. See WARNINGS . Although the usual starting adult dose range reported in clinical studies was 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC administration sets. THE USE OF NON-ABSORBING TUBING WILL RESULT IN THE NEED FOR REDUCED DOSES. If a peristaltic action infusion pump is used, an appropriate administration set should be selected with a drip chamber that delivers approximately 60 microdrops/mL. Table 1 and the Nitroglycerin Injection Dilution Table below may be used to calculate the nitroglycerin dilution and flow rate in microdrops/minute to achieve the desired Nitroglycerin Injection administration rate. If a volumetric infusion pump is used, an appropriate volumetric infusion pump connector set should be selected. Table 1 below may still be used; however, flow rate will be determined directly by the infusion pump, independent of the drop size of the appropriate set drip chambers. Thus, the reference to ``microdrops/min\u2032\u2032 is not applicable, and the corresponding flow rate in mL/hr should be used to determine pump settings. When using a non-absorbing infusion set, the initial dosage should be 5 mcg/min delivered through an infusion pump capable of exact and constant delivery of the drug. Subsequent titration must be adjusted to the clinical situation, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments, with increases every 3-5 minutes until some response is noted. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and later 20 mcg/min can be used. Once a partial blood pressure response is observed, the dose increase should be reduced and the interval between increases should be lengthened. Some patients with normal or low left ventricular filling pressures or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (e.g., angina patients without other complications) may be hypersensitive to the effects of nitroglycerin and may respond fully to doses as small as 5 mcg/min. These patients require especially careful titration and monitoring. There is no fixed optimum dose of nitroglycerin. Due to variations in the responsiveness of individual patients to the drug, each patient must be titrated to the desired level of hemodynamic function. Therefore, continuous monitoring of physiologic parameters (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate in all patients, other measurements such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as appropriate) MUST be performed to achieve the correct dose. Adequate systemic blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure must be maintained. Dilution: Nitroglycerin Injection is supplied in 5 mg/mL solution. A dilution and administration scheme for Nitroglycerin Injection is shown in Table 1 below. 60 MICRODROPS = 1 mL NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION DILUTION TABLE (Diluent: Dextrose 5% Injection or Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%)) NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Recommended dosage Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. 2.2 Priming The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17)]. The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Do not use Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. 4.2 Severe Anemia Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients with severe anemia (large doses of nitroglycerin may cause oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin and could exacerbate anemia). 4.3 Increased Intracranial Pressure Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may precipitate or aggravate increased intracranial pressure and thus should not be used in patients with possible increased intracranial pressure (e. g. cerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury). 4.4 Hypersensitivity Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to nitroglycerin, other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient. 4.5 Circulatory Failure and Shock Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients with acute circulatory failure or shock."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use."

Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency greater than 2% and greater than placebo included: headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of nitroglycerin lingual spray and other nitroglycerin drugs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurologic: weakness, drowsiness Dermatologic: cutaneous vasodilation, flushing, drug rash, exfoliative dermatitis Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting Respiratory: transient hypoxemia Cardiovascular: tachycardia"

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 PDE-5-inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). PDE5 inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another cannot be recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C - Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin lingual spray. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. A teratogenicity study was conducted in the third mating of F0 generation female rats administered dietary nitroglycerin for gestation day 6 to day 15 at dose levels used in the 3-generation reproduction study. In offspring of the high-dose nitroglycerin group, increased incidence of diaphragmatic hernias and decreased hyoid bone ossification were seen. The latter finding probably reflects delayed development rather than a potential teratogenic effect, thus indicating no clear evidence of teratogenicity of nitroglycerin. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (less than 65 years) patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and symptoms, methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of nitroglycerin lingual spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean Cmax and tmax were 1.041 pg/mL and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12.769 pg/mL \u00b7 min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingual nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues and for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Recommended dosage Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. 2.2 Priming The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17)]. The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use."

Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency greater than 2% and greater than placebo included: headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of nitroglycerin lingual spray and other nitroglycerin drugs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 PDE-5-inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). PDE5 inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another cannot be recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C - Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin lingual spray. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. A teratogenicity study was conducted in the third mating of F0 generation female rats administered dietary nitroglycerin for gestation day 6 to day 15 at dose levels used in the 3-generation reproduction study. In offspring of the high-dose nitroglycerin group, increased incidence of diaphragmatic hernias and decreased hyoid bone ossification were seen. The latter finding probably reflects delayed development rather than a potential teratogenic effect, thus indicating no clear evidence of teratogenicity of nitroglycerin. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (less than 65 years) patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and symptoms, methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of nitroglycerin lingual spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean Cmax and tmax were 1.041 pg/mL and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12.769 pg/mL \u00b7 min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingual nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues and for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see PATIENT INFORMATION ]. The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

      "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ]. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use."

      "DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 \u2013 4% and 15 \u2013 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day for 13 days, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day for 11 days, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day for 13 days. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (less than 65 years) patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1 % solution), 1 \u2013 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean Cmax and tmax were 1,041 pg/ml and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12,769 pg/ml * min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingual nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52 % vs. 0 % in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52 % vs. 8 % in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues and for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high- dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

Headache: Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches which may be severe ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders Venous and arterial dilatation as a consequence of nitroglycerin treatment including nitroglycerin ointment, can decrease venous blood returning to the heart and reduce arterial vascular resistance and systolic pressure. Exercise caution when treating patients with any of the following conditions: blood volume depletion, existing hypotension, cardiomyopathies, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or poor cardiac function for other reasons. If patients with any of these conditions are treated with nitroglycerin ointment, monitor cardiovascular status and clinical condition. The adverse reactions of nitroglycerin ointment are likely to be more pronounced in the elderly. 5.2 Headache Nitroglycerin ointment produces dose-related headaches, which may be severe. Tolerance to headaches occurs."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction of nitroglycerin ointment 0.4% applied to the anal canal is headache. Headache may be recurrent following each dose. Headaches are typically of short duration and can be treated with an analgesic, e.g. acetaminophen, and are reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. In Study REC-C-001, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a painful chronic anal fissure, the most frequent (\u2265 2%) adverse reactions reported were as follows (Table 1): Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions (\u2265 2%) in Study REC-C-001 Nitroglycerin Ointment N = 123 Placebo N = 124 System Organ Class Preferred term Patients n (%) Events n Patients n (%) Events n Nervous system disorders Headache 79 (64) 938 51 (41) 225 Dizziness 6 (5) 26 0 0 Most common adverse reactions are headache and dizziness.

Hypotension Transient episodes of light-headedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, also may occur. Hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) occurs infrequently, but in some patients may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Allergic Reactions Flushing, allergic reactions, and application site reactions (including drug rash and exfoliative dermatitis) have been reported rarely. Methemoglobinemia In rare cases, therapeutic doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia (see 10 OVERDOSAGE )."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS PDE5 inhibitors: potentiation of hypotensive effects of organic nitrates; concomitant use is contraindicated. ( 4.1 , 7.1 ) Antihypertensives: possible additive hypotensive effects. ( 7.2 ) Aspirin: increased nitroglycerin levels. ( 7.3 ) Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA): decreased thrombolytic effect. ( 7.4 ) Heparin: anticoagulant effect of heparin may be reduced. Monitor APTT. ( 7.5 ) Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. ( 7.6 ) Alcohol: Additive vasodilatory effects to nitroglycerin. Consumption of alcohol should be avoided. ( 7.7 ) 7.1 PDE5 Inhibitors Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. The time course of the interaction appears to be related to the half-life of the PDE5 inhibitor, however, the dose dependence of this interaction has not been studied. Use of nitroglycerin ointment within a few days of PDE5 inhibitors is contraindicated. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and other nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects when using nitroglycerin ointment. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin ointment in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Aspirin Coadministration of aspirin (at doses between 500 mg and 1000 mg) and nitroglycerin has been reported to result in increased nitroglycerin maximum concentrations by as much as 67% and AUC by 73% when administered as a single dose. The pharmacological effects of nitroglycerin ointment may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. 7.4 Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Plasma levels of t-PA are reduced when coadministered with nitroglycerin. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment during t-PA therapy. 7.5 Heparin Although an interaction has been reported between intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin (resulting in a decrease in the anticoagulant effect of heparin), the data are not consistent. If patients are to receive intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin ointment concurrently, the anticoagulation status of the patient must be checked. 7.6 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and consequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore the possibility of ergotism in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment should be considered. 7.7 Alcohol The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin have been shown to be additive to the effects observed with alcohol."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin ointment. Nitroglycerin was not teratogenic when administered by topical or dietary route. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. A teratogenicity study was conducted in rats with nitroglycerin administered in the diet at levels up to 1% content (approximately 430 mg/kg/day) on days 6 to 15 of gestation. In offspring of the high-dose group, an increased but not statistically significant incidence of diaphragmatic hernias was noted together with decreased hyoid bone ossification. The latter finding probably reflects delayed development, thus indicating no clear evidence of a potential teratogenic effect of nitroglycerin. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin ointment is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin ointment in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin ointment did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Clinical data from the published literature indicate that the elderly demonstrate increased sensitivity to nitrates, which may be therapeutic but also manifest by more frequent or severe hypotension and related dizziness or fainting. Increased sensitivity may reflect the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Nitroglycerin toxicity is generally mild. The estimated adult oral lethal dose of nitroglycerin is 200 mg to 1,200 mg. Infants may be more susceptible to toxicity from nitroglycerin. Consultation with a poison center should be considered. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which if any of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is not recommended. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin ointment overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate arterial PO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Intra-anal application of nitroglycerin reduces sphincter tone and resting intra-anal pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: Nitroglycerin is metabolized by a liver reductase enzyme to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, the two major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols are found in plasma. The contribution of metabolites to the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is unknown. The dinitrates are further metabolized to nonvasoactive mononitrates and ultimately to glycerol and carbon dioxide. Elimination: Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly with a mean elimination half-life of two to three minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow."

Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay with Salmonella typhimurium . A similar mutation in this S. typhimurium was also reported with other NO donors. There was no evidence of clastogenic potential in multiple assays including a rodent dominant lethal assay, an in vitro Chinese Hamster Ovary assay that was conducted in the absence of metabolic activation, and several in vivo chromosomal aberration assays conducted in rats and dogs. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to approximately 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males."

This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin ointment, ask your healthcare provider. What is nitroglycerin ointment? Nitroglycerin ointment is a prescription medicine used to treat moderate to severe pain caused by chronic anal fissures. An anal fissure is a tear in the skin lining the anal canal. Nitroglycerin ointment is not suitable for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because it has not been assessed in people in this age group. Who should not use nitroglycerin ointment? Do not use nitroglycerin ointment if you: are taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction (male impotence), for example Viagra (sildenafil), Cialis (tadalafil) or Levitra (vardenafil). have been told by your doctor that you have severe anemia (low numbers of red blood cells in your blood) have increased intracranial pressure or high pressure within your skull e.g. following head trauma or bleeding in your brain are allergic to any of the ingredients in nitroglycerin ointment or if you have had allergic reactions to similar medicines in the past. See the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in nitroglycerin ointment. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using nitroglycerin ointment? Tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you: have low blood pressure have recently had a heart attack have heart or blood vessel disorders suffer from migraine or recurrent headaches are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if nitroglycerin ointment will harm your unborn baby. are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. It is not known if the components of nitroglycerin ointment will harm your child if you breast-feed. Nitroglycerin ointment may lower your blood pressure. When getting up from a lying or sitting position, you should get up slowly, otherwise you might feel faint. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. Other medicines may affect how nitroglycerin ointment works. Nitroglycerin ointment may also affect how other medicines work. Specifically, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: other nitroglycerin containing products a medicine for erectile dysfunction (male impotence), for example sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil (see the section above \u2018Who should not use nitroglycerin ointment') medicines used to treat high blood pressure are taking aspirin, ergotamine (used to treat migraine) or are receiving tissue-type plasminogen activator (used to help dissolve blood clots formed in blood vessels in the heart, lungs and brain) are to be given heparin. If so, close monitoring of your blood will be required as your dose of heparin may need to be altered. Please discuss with your doctor before stopping nitroglycerin ointment. How should nitroglycerin ointment be used? Use nitroglycerin ointment exactly as prescribed . See detailed Patient Instructions for Applying nitroglycerin ointment at the end of this Patient Information leaflet. Treatment may be continued for up to 3 weeks. If your anal pain does not get better after using nitroglycerin ointment you should talk to your doctor. What should I avoid while using nitroglycerin ointment? Do not drive or operate machinery immediately after applying nitroglycerin ointment. If you feel dizzy or light-headed after applying the ointment do not drive or operate machinery until the dizziness has stopped. Avoid consuming alcohol while you are being treated with nitroglycerin ointment as your blood pressure is more likely to be affected if you consume alcoholic beverages. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin ointment? Nitroglycerin ointment can cause serious side-effects: Stop using the ointment and seek medical attention immediately if you have an allergic reaction. You may have swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat, or difficulty breathing. Common side-effects of nitroglycerin ointment are: Headaches, which can be severe. You could take painkillers for this (such as acetaminophen). If the headaches are unpleasant, you may need to ask your doctor whether you should stop using nitroglycerin ointment. Dizziness, faintness on standing, or light-headedness These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin ointment. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

Starting at the tip of the finger, squeeze the ointment onto your finger for the same length marked on the box. Refer to carton for accurate dosage guide. Gently insert the finger with the ointment into the anal canal, up to the first finger joint. Carefully smear the ointment around the inner sides of the anal canal. If this cannot be achieved due to pain, application of the ointment should be made directly to the outside of the anus. What do I do after I have applied the ointment? Throw away the finger covering in the garbage, out of the reach of children and pets. Wash your hands. What are the ingredients in nitroglycerin ointment? Active ingredient: nitroglycerin Inactive ingredients: propylene glycol, lanolin, sorbitan sesquioleate, paraffin wax and white petrolatum. Distributed by: Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

      "DESCRIPTION: Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: whose empiric formula is C 3 H 5 N 3 O 9 , and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. Nitroglycerin Injection, USP is a clear, practically colorless additive solution for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each mL contains: Nitroglycerin 5 mg, Alcohol 30% (v/v), Propylene Glycol 30%, and Water for Injection q.s. pH (range 3.0 to 6.5) may have been adjusted with Sodium Hydroxide and/or Hydrochloric Acid. The solution is sterile, non-pyrogenic, and nonexplosive. structural formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of Nitroglycerin Injection is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Clinical Trials: Blinded, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have not been reported, but multiple investigators have reported open-label studies, and there are scattered reports of studies in which intravenous nitroglycerin was tested in blinded fashion against sodium nitroprusside. In each of these studies, therapeutic doses of intravenous nitroglycerin were found to reduce systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The heart rate was usually increased, presumably as a reflexive response to the fall in blood pressure. Coronary perfusion pressure was usually, but not always, maintained. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduced central venous pressure (CVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). When these parameters were elevated, reducing them toward normal usually caused a rise in cardiac output. Conversely, intravenous nitroglycerin usually reduced cardiac output when it was given to patients whose CVP, RAP, PAP, PCWP, PVR, AND SVR were all normal. Most clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin have been brief; they have typically followed hemodynamic parameters during a single surgical procedure. In one careful study, one of the few that lasted more than a few hours, continuous intravenous nitroglycerin had lost almost all of its hemodynamic effect after 48 hours. In the same study, patients who received nitroglycerin infusions for only 12 hours out of each 24 demonstrated no similar attenuation of effect. These results are consistent with those seen in multiple large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other formulations of nitroglycerin and other nitrates."

Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with volume expansion. Nitroglycerin readily migrates into many plastics, including the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics commonly used for intravenous administration sets. Nitroglycerin absorption by PVC tubing is increased when the tubing is long, the flow rates are low, and the nitroglycerin concentration of the solution is high. The delivered fraction of the solution's original nitroglycerin content has been 20-60% in published studies using PVC tubing; the fraction varies with time during a single infusion, and no simple correction factor can be used. PVC tubing has been used in most published studies of intravenous nitroglycerin, but the reported doses have been calculated by simply multiplying the flow rate of the solution by the solution's original concentration of nitroglycerin. The actual doses delivered have been less, sometimes much less, than those reported. Some in-line intravenous filters also absorb nitroglycerin; these filters should be avoided. Because of the problem of nitroglycerin absorption by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing, Nitroglycerin Injection should be used with the least absorptive infusion tubing (i.e., non-PVC tubing) available. DOSING INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED WITH CARE. WHEN THE APPROPRIATE INFUSION SETS ARE USED, THE CALCULATED DOSE WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT, BECAUSE THE LOSS OF NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SEEN WITH STANDARD PVC TUBING WILL BE AVOIDED. THE DOSAGES REPORTED IN PUBLISHED STUDIES UTILIZED GENERAL-USE PVC ADMINISTRATION SETS, AND RECOMMENDED DOSES BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE WILL BE TOO HIGH WHEN THE LOW-ABSORBING INFUSION SETS ARE USED."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Severe hypotension and shock may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24- hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of intravenous nitroglycerin is not known. Lower concentrations of nitroglycerin increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. Nitroglycerin infusions should be administered only via a pump that can maintain a constant infusion rate. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin infusions has not been studied. Laboratory Tests: Because of the propylene glycol content of intravenous nitroglycerin, serum triglyceride assays that rely on glycerol oxidase may give falsely elevated results in patients receiving this medication. Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Administration of nitroglycerin infusions through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. More generally, nitroglycerin in 5% dextrose or sodium chloride 0.9% should not be mixed with any other medication of any kind. Intravenous nitroglycerin interferes, at least in some patients, with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. In patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, concomitant heparin therapy should be guided by frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Animal carcinogenesis studies with injectable nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high doses, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high-dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin injection. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits, however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman."

Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE )."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitation; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which-if any-of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u226510%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR DIRECT INTRAVENOUS INJECTION NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION IS A CONCENTRATED, POTENT DRUG WHICH MUST BE DILUTED IN DEXTROSE (5%) INJECTION OR SODIUM CHLORIDE (0.9%) INJECTION PRIOR TO ITS INFUSION. NITROGLYCERIN INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS. Initial Dilution: Aseptically transfer the contents of one nitroglycerin vial (50 mg of nitroglycerin) into a 500 mL glass bottle of either Dextrose (5%) Injection or Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%). This yields a final concentration of 100 mcg/mL. Diluting 5 mg nitroglycerin into 100 mL will yield a final concentration of 50 mcg/mL. Maintenance Dilution: It is important to consider the fluid requirements of the patient as well as the expected duration of infusion in selecting the appropriate dilution of Nitroglycerin Injection. After the initial dosage titration, the concentration of the solution may be increased, if necessary, to limit fluids given to the patient. The nitroglycerin concentration should not exceed 400 mcg/mL. See chart. Note: If the concentration is adjusted, it is imperative to flush or replace the infusion set before a new concentration is utilized. If the set were not flushed or replaced, it could take minutes to hours, depending upon the flow rate and the dead space of the set, for the new concentration to reach the patient. Invert the glass parenteral bottle several times to assure uniform dilution of the nitroglycerin. Dosage is affected by the type of container and administration set used. See WARNINGS . Although the usual starting adult dose range reported in clinical studies was 25 mcg/min or more, these studies used PVC administration sets. THE USE OF NON-ABSORBING TUBING WILL RESULT IN THE NEED FOR REDUCED DOSES. If a peristaltic action infusion pump is used, an appropriate administration set should be selected with a drip chamber that delivers approximately 60 microdrops/mL. Table 1 and the Nitroglycerin Injection Dilution Table below may be used to calculate the nitroglycerin dilution and flow rate in microdrops/minute to achieve the desired Nitroglycerin Injection administration rate. If a volumetric infusion pump is used, an appropriate volumetric infusion pump connector set should be selected. Table 1 below may still be used; however, flow rate will be determined directly by the infusion pump, independent of the drop size of the appropriate set drip chambers. Thus, the reference to ``microdrops/min\u2032\u2032 is not applicable, and the corresponding flow rate in mL/hr should be used to determine pump settings. When using a non-absorbing infusion set, the initial dosage should be 5 mcg/min delivered through an infusion pump capable of exact and constant delivery of the drug. Subsequent titration must be adjusted to the clinical situation, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments, with increases every 3-5 minutes until some response is noted. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and later 20 mcg/min can be used. Once a partial blood pressure response is observed, the dose increase should be reduced and the interval between increases should be lengthened. Some patients with normal or low left ventricular filling pressures or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (e.g., angina patients without other complications) may be hypersensitive to the effects of nitroglycerin and may respond fully to doses as small as 5 mcg/min. These patients require especially careful titration and monitoring. There is no fixed optimum dose of nitroglycerin. Due to variations in the responsiveness of individual patients to the drug, each patient must be titrated to the desired level of hemodynamic function. Therefore, continuous monitoring of physiologic parameters (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate in all patients, other measurements such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as appropriate) MUST be performed to achieve the correct dose. Adequate systemic blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure must be maintained. Dilution: Nitroglycerin Injection is supplied in 5 mg/mL solution.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. Nitroglycerin ointment USP, 2% for topical use contains lactose and 2% nitroglycerin in a base of lanolin, white petrolatum and purified water. Each inch (2.5 cm), as squeezed from the tube, contains approximately 15 mg of nitroglycerin. structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored. Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about three minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10 - 12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. Reliable assay techniques for plasma nitroglycerin levels have only recently become available, and studies using these techniques to define the pharmacokinetics of nitroglycerin ointment have not been reported. Published studies using older techniques provide results that often differ, in similar experimental settings, by an order of magnitude. The data are consistent, however, in suggesting that nitroglycerin levels rise to steady state within an hour or so of application of ointment, and that after removal of nitroglycerin ointment, levels wane with a half-life of about half an hour. The onset of action of transdermal nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode. The maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal activity provided by nitroglycerin ointment therapy has not been studied. Recent studies of other formulations of nitroglycerin suggest that the maximal achievable daily duration of antianginal effect from nitroglycerin ointment will be about 12 hours. It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied. Clinical Trials: Controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin. In some controlled trials of other organic nitrate formulations, efficacy has declined with time. Because controlled, long-term trials of nitroglycerin ointment have not been reported, it is not known how the efficacy of nitroglycerin ointment may vary during extended therapy."

      "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pains, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of transdermal nitroglycerin is not known. Information for Patients Daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with nitroglycerin, since loss of headache is likely to be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Patient instruction leaflet is included. Drug Interactions The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of nitroglycerin have not been performed. Nitroglycerin's effect upon reproductive capacity is similarly unknown. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin. It is also not known whether nitroglycerin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related, and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients; for further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment see OVERDOSAGE. Data are not available to allow estimation of the frequency of adverse reactions during treatment with nitroglycerin ointment."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. Nitroglycerin ointment USP, 2% for topical use contains lactose and 2% nitroglycerin in a base of lanolin, white petrolatum and purified water. Each inch (2.5 cm), as squeezed from the tube, contains approximately 15 mg of nitroglycerin. Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which\u2014if any\u2014of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or the arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u2265 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION As noted above ( CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin. It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied. Controlled trials with other formulations of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that if plasma levels are maintained continuously, all anti-anginal efficacy is lost within 24 hours. This tolerance cannot be overcome by increasing the dose of nitroglycerin. As a result, any regimen of nitroglycerin ointment administration should include a daily nitrate-free interval. The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10 to 12 hours is sufficient. Thus, one appropriate dosing schedule for nitroglycerin ointment would begin with two daily 1/2- inch (7.5 mg) doses, one applied on rising in the morning and one applied six hours later. The dose could be doubled, and even doubled again, in patients tolerating this dose but failing to respond to it. The pouch is intended as a unit dose package only and is equivalent to approximately 1 inch as squeezed from the tube. Use entire contents of pouch to obtain full dose and discard immediately after use. Each tube of ointment and each box of pouchs is supplied with a pad of ruled, impermeable, paper applicators. These applicators allow ointment to be absorbed through a much smaller area of skin than that used in any of the reported clinical trials, and the significance of this difference is not known. To apply the ointment using one of the applicators, place the applicator on a flat surface, printed side down. Squeeze the necessary amount of ointment from the tube onto the applicator, place the applicator (ointment side down) on the desired area of the skin, and tape the applicator into place."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Mechanism of Action: Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. Pharmacodynamics: Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption: Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Distribution: The volume of distribution (VArea) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination: Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. CLINICAL"

Administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride) since these compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates.

      "WARNINGS The benefits of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed. Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens that incorporated a 10- to 12-hour nitrate free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. Nitrate tolerance as a result of sublingual nitroglycerin administration is probably possible, but only in patients who maintain high continuous nitrate levels for more than 10 or 12 hours daily. Such use of sublingual nitroglycerin would entail administration of scores of tablets daily and is not recommended. The drug should be discontinued if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches. Information for Patients Nitroglycerin is a sublingual tablet and should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. If possible, patients should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and should use caution when returning to a standing position. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. Nitroglycerin may produce a burning or tingling sensation when administered sublingually; however, the ability to produce a burning or tingling sensation should not be considered a reliable method for determining the potency of the tablets. Headaches can sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness upon standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Nitroglycerin should be kept in the original glass container and must be tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Drug Interactions Concomitant use of nitroglycerin with soluble guanylate cyclasestimulators is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of alteplase. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin during alteplase therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Nitrates may interfere with the Zlatkis-Zak color reaction, causing a false report of decreased serum cholesterol. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Category B. Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. However, teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at dosages up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively revealed no toxic effects on dams or fetuses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported in association with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. During administration the patient should rest, preferably in the sitting position. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal failure."

      "PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablet is right for you. What is nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medications to treat depression or psychiatric illness. You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking the blood thinner medicine heparin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute, period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause a false test result of decreased serum cholesterol. Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at 20\u00b0-25\u00b0C (68\u00b0-77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, or call Dr. Reddy\u2019s Medical Information Department, at 1-888-375-3784.

(5.2) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

(7.2) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris.Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7-17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6-18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload).Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension- time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration- time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingualtablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2\u03a7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Tablets 1\u03a7 0.6 mg NitroglycerinTablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u00a5), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin : Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high- dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablet is right for you. What is nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets) . You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medications to treat depression or psychiatric illness. You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking the blood thinner medicine heparin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute, period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause a false test result of decreased serum cholesterol. Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at 20\u00b0-25\u00b0C (68\u00b0-77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or call Dr. Reddy\u2019s Medical Information Department, at 1-888-375-3784.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Mechanism of Action: Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. Pharmacodynamics: Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption: Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism.

At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination: Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination."

Administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride) since these compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates.

      "WARNINGS The benefits of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed. Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens that incorporated a 10- to 12-hour nitrate free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. Nitrate tolerance as a result of sublingual nitroglycerin administration is probably possible, but only in patients who maintain high continuous nitrate levels for more than 10 or 12 hours daily. Such use of sublingual nitroglycerin would entail administration of scores of tablets daily and is not recommended. The drug should be discontinued if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches. Information for Patients Nitroglycerin is a sublingual tablet and should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. If possible, patients should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and should use caution when returning to a standing position. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. Nitroglycerin may produce a burning or tingling sensation when administered sublingually; however, the ability to produce a burning or tingling sensation should not be considered a reliable method for determining the potency of the tablets. Headaches can sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness upon standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Nitroglycerin should be kept in the original glass container and must be tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Drug Interactions Concomitant use of nitroglycerin with soluble guanylate cyclasestimulators is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of alteplase. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin during alteplase therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Nitrates may interfere with the Zlatkis-Zak color reaction, causing a false report of decreased serum cholesterol. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Category B . Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. However, teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at dosages up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively revealed no toxic effects on dams or fetuses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "General Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed. Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens that incorporated a 10- to 12-hour nitrate free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. Nitrate tolerance as a result of sublingual nitroglycerin administration is probably possible, but only in patients who maintain high continuous nitrate levels for more than 10 or 12 hours daily. Such use of sublingual nitroglycerin would entail administration of scores of tablets daily and is not recommended. The drug should be discontinued if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Nitroglycerin is a sublingual tablet and should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. If possible, patients should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and should use caution when returning to a standing position. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. Nitroglycerin may produce a burning or tingling sensation when administered sublingually; however, the ability to produce a burning or tingling sensation should not be considered a reliable method for determining the potency of the tablets. Headaches can sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness upon standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Nitroglycerin should be kept in the original glass container and must be tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Concomitant use of nitroglycerin with soluble guanylate cyclasestimulators is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of alteplase. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin during alteplase therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin\u2019s capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; tachycardia; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported in association with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

      "PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP (nahy-truh-glis-er-in) Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablet is right for you. What is nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets) . You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medications to treat depression or psychiatric illness. You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking the blood thinner medicine heparin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute, period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause a false test result of decreased serum cholesterol. Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin . For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at 20\u00b0-25\u00b0C (68\u00b0-77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , or call Dr. Reddy\u2019s Medical Information Department, at 1-888-375-3784.

Repeat every 5 minutes as needed (2.1). \u2022 Do up to three metered sprays within a 15-minute period. If chest pain persists, advise prompt medical attention (2.1). \u2022 May be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack (2.1). 2.1 Recommended Dosage Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. 2.2 Priming The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17) ] . The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

Avoid concomitant use (7.3) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 \u2013 4% and 15 \u2013 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day for 13 days, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day for 11 days, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day for 13 days. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (less than 65 years) patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of nitroglycerin lingual spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean C max and t max were 1.041 pg/mL and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12.769 pg/mL * min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin : Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males.

      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol, trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is: and whose molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. The nitroglycerin transdermal system is a flat unit designed to provide continuous controlled release of nitroglycerin through intact skin. The rate of release of nitroglycerin is linearly dependent upon the area of the applied system; each cm 2 of applied system delivers approximately 0.026 mg of nitroglycerin per hour. Thus, the 4 cm 2 , 8 cm 2 , 16 cm 2 and 24 cm 2 systems deliver approximately 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg of nitroglycerin per hour, respectively. The remainder of the nitroglycerin in each system serves as a reservoir and is not delivered in normal use. After 12 hours, for example, each system has delivered approximately 11% of its original content of nitroglycerin. The nitroglycerin transdermal system comprises two layers as shown below. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: 1) a polyolefin film backing layer that is impermeable to nitroglycerin and is printed with the name of the drug and strength; 2) nitroglycerin in an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive. Prior to use, a peelable polyester release liner, which is coated on one side with silicone, is removed from the adhesive surface. Each unit is sealed in a foil-lined pouch.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their antianginal efficacy restored. Pharmacokinetics The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow, known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (nonvasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10 to 12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. In healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin are reached by about 2 hours after application of a patch and are maintained for the duration of wearing the system (observations have been limited to 24 hours). Upon removal of the patch, the plasma concentration declines with a half-life of about an hour. Clinical Trials Regimens in which nitroglycerin patches were worn for 12 hours daily have been studied in well controlled trials up to 4 weeks in duration. Starting about 2 hours after application and continuing until 10 to 12 hours after application, patches that deliver at least 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin per hour have consistently demonstrated greater antianginal activity than placebo. Lower dose patches have not been as well studied, but in one large, well controlled trial in which higher dose patches were also studied, patches delivering 0.2 mg/hr had significantly less antianginal activity than placebo. It is reasonable to believe that the rate of nitroglycerin absorption from patches may vary with the site of application, but this relationship has not been adequately studied. The onset of action of transdermal nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode."

Allergy to the adhesives used in nitroglycerin patches has also been reported, and it similarly constitutes a contraindication to the use of this product. Do not use Nitroglycerin Transdermal Systems in patients who are taking phosphodiesterase inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for erectile dysfunction or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Concomitant use can cause severe drops in blood pressure. Do not use Nitroglycerin Transdermal Systems in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of Nitroglycerin Transdermal Systems by sildenafil may result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia. A cardioverter/defibrillator should not be discharged through a paddle electrode that overlies a nitroglycerin transdermal patch. The arcing that may be seen in this situation is harmless in itself, but it may be associated with local current concentration that can cause damage to the paddles and burns to the patient."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated nitroglycerin regimens which incorporated a 10 to 12 hour nitrate-free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate-free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients demonstrated decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate-free interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of transdermal nitroglycerin is unknown. Information for Patients Daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with nitroglycerin, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. After normal use, there is enough residual nitroglycerin in discarded patches that they are a potential hazard to children and pets. A patient leaflet is supplied with the systems. See Patient Information at the end of this insert. Drug Interactions The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin Transdermal Systems with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin Transdermal Systems with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with topically applied nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenetic tests in rat and dog tissues. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy Category C Animal teratology studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin transdermal systems. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits; however, were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of transdermal nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose related, and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin\u2019s activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of light-headedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Allergic reactions to nitroglycerin are also uncommon, and the great majority of those reported have been cases of contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions in patients receiving nitroglycerin in ointments or patches. There have been a few reports of genuine anaphylactoid reactions, and these reactions can probably occur in patients receiving nitroglycerin by any route. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE ). Application-site irritation may occur but is rarely severe. In two placebo-controlled trials of intermittent therapy with nitroglycerin patches at 0.2 to 0.8 mg/hr, the most frequent adverse reactions among 307 subjects were as follows: Placebo Patch Headache 18% 63% Light-headedness 4% 6% Hypotension, and/or syncope 0% 4% Increased angina 2% 2%"

      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the result of nitroglycerin\u2019s capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward an increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (\u2265 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The suggested starting dose is between 0.2 mg/hr and 0.4 mg/hr. Doses between 0.4 mg/hr and 0.8 mg/hr have shown continued effectiveness for 10 to 12 hours daily for at least one month (the longest period studied) of intermittent administration. Although the minimum nitrate-free interval has not been defined, data show that a nitrate-free interval of 10 to 12 hours is sufficient (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Thus, an appropriate dosing schedule for nitroglycerin patches would include a daily patch-on period of 12 to 14 hours and a daily patch-off period of 10 to 12 hours. Although some well controlled clinical trials using exercise tolerance testing have shown maintenance of effectiveness when patches are worn continuously, the large majority of such controlled trials have shown the development of tolerance (i.e., complete loss of effect) within the first 24 hours after therapy was initiated. Dose adjustment, even to levels much higher than generally used, did not restore efficacy. PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION OF SYSTEM A patient leaflet is supplied with each carton."

      "Patient Information How to use NITROGLYCERIN TRANSDERMAL SYSTEM for the prevention of angina The Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch is easy to use \u2013 it has a clear peelable liner, and a special adhesive that keeps the patch firmly in place. Where to place the Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch Select any area of skin on the body, EXCEPT the extremities below the knee or elbow. The chest is the preferred site. The area should be clean, dry, and hairless. If hair is likely to interfere with patch adhesion or removal, it can be clipped but not shaved. Take care to avoid areas with cuts or irritations. Do NOT apply the patch immediately after showering or bathing. It is best to wait until you are certain the skin is completely dry. How to apply the Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch \u2022 Each Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch is individually sealed in a protective package. Open the pouch at the tear mark. Carefully remove the patch. The patch is printed with the wording \u2018 Nitroglycerin \u2019 and the amount of nitroglycerin delivered each hour. The patch is attached to a clear peelable liner. The liner has a slit which divides it into two strips. Hold the patch with the wording facing away from you. The slit should now be facing toward you. Rotate the patch as necessary to place the slit in an up and down position. \u2022 Bend both sides of the clear peelable liner away from you at the slit. \u2022 Slowly peel off only one of the strips of the clear liner. Do not touch the exposed sticky side of the patch. \u2022 Using the remaining strip as a \u201chandle\u201d, apply the exposed sticky side of the patch to the skin. Press the sticky side on the chosen skin site and smooth down. \u2022 Fold back the unattached side of the patch. Grasp the remaining strip and remove it while applying the remainder of the patch to the skin. Press the patch on the skin and smooth down with the palm of your hand. Once the patch is in place, do not test the adhesion by pulling on it. When Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch is applied to your body, the nitroglycerin contained in the patch begins to flow from the adhesive surface through your skin at a uniform rate. \u2022 After applying the patch, wash hands to remove any drug. \u2022 At the time recommended by your doctor, remove and discard the patch. \u2022 Place a new patch on a different skin site (following steps 1 through 6) according to your doctor\u2019s instructions. Please note: Contact with water, as in bathing, swimming, or showering will not affect the patch. In the unlikely event that a patch falls off, discard it and put a new one on a different skin site. Precautions: The most common side effect is headache, which often decreases as therapy is continued, but may require treatment with a mild analgesic. Although uncommon, faintness, flushing, and dizziness may occur, especially when suddenly rising from the recumbent (lying horizontal) position. If these symptoms occur, remove the patch and notify your physician. Skin irritation may occur. If it persists, consult your physician. Keep these patches and all drugs out of the reach of children. Important: Your doctor may decide to increase or decrease the size of the patch, or prescribe a combination of patches, to suit your particular needs. The dose may vary depending on your individual response to the patch. This patch is to be used for preventing angina, not for treating an acute attack. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F). Do not refrigerate. Do not store outside of the protective package. Apply immediately upon removal from the protective package.

A finger covering, such as plastic-wrap, disposable surgical glove or a finger cot, should be placed on the finger to apply the ointment. To obtain a 1.5 mg dose of nitroglycerin, the covered finger is laid alongside the 1 inch dosing line on the carton. Refer to carton for accurate dosage guide. The tube is gently squeezed until a line of ointment the length of the measuring line is expressed onto the covered finger. The ointment is gently inserted into the anal canal using the covered finger no further than to the first finger joint and the ointment is applied around the side of the anal canal. If this cannot be achieved due to pain, application of the ointment should be made directly to the outside of the anus. Treatment may be continued for up to three weeks. Nitroglycerin ointment is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Hands should be washed after application of the ointment.

The most common adverse reaction of nitroglycerin ointment applied to the anal canal is headache. Headache may be recurrent following each dose. Headaches are typically of short duration and can be treated with an analgesic, e.g. acetaminophen, and are reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. In Study REC-C-001, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a painful chronic anal fissure, the most frequent (\u00b3 2%) adverse reactions reported were as follows (Table 1): Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions ( \u00b3 2%) in Study REC-C-001 Nitroglycerin ointment N = 123 Placebo N = 124 System Organ Class Preferred term Patients n (%) Events n Patients n (%) Events n Nervous system disorders Headache 79 (64) 938 51 (41) 225 Dizziness 6 (5) 26 0 0 Hypotension Transient episodes of light-headedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, also may occur. Hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) occurs infrequently, but in some patients may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Allergic Reactions Flushing, allergic reactions, and application site reactions (including drug rash and exfoliative dermatitis) have been reported rarely. Methemoglobinemia In rare cases, therapeutic doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia [ see OVERDOSAGE(10) ] . Most common adverse reactions are headache and dizziness.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS PDE5 inhibitors: potentiation of hypotensive effects of organic nitrates; concomitant use is contraindicated. ( 4.1 , 7.1 ) Antihypertensives: possible additive hypotensive effects. ( 7.2 ) Aspirin: increased nitroglycerin levels. ( 7.3 ) Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA): decreased thrombolytic effect. ( 7.4 ) Heparin: anticoagulant effect of heparin may be reduced. Monitor APTT. ( 7.5 ) Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. ( 7.6 ) Alcohol: Additive vasodilatory effects to nitroglycerin. Consumption of alcohol should be avoided. ( 7.7 ) 7.1 PDE5 Inhibitors Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. The time course of the interaction appears to be related to the half-life of the PDE5 inhibitor, however, the dose dependence of this interaction has not been studied. Use of nitroglycerin ointment within a few days of PDE5 inhibitors is contraindicated. 7.2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and other nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects when using nitroglycerin ointment. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin ointment in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7.3 Aspirin Coadministration of aspirin (at doses between 500 mg and 1000 mg) and nitroglycerin has been reported to result in increased nitroglycerin maximum concentrations by as much as 67% and AUC by 73% when administered as a single dose. The pharmacological effects of nitroglycerin ointment may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. 7.4 Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Plasma levels of t-PA are reduced when coadministered with nitroglycerin. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment during t-PA therapy. 7.5 Heparin Although an interaction has been reported between intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin (resulting in a decrease in the anticoagulant effect of heparin), the data are not consistent. If patients are to receive intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin ointment concurrently, the anticoagulation status of the patient must be checked. 7.6 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and consequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore the possibility of ergotism in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment should be considered. 7.7 Alcohol The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin have been shown to be additive to the effects observed with alcohol."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data on the use of nitroglycerin ointment intra-anally during pregnancy to determine a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no malformations were observed in offspring of pregnant rats and rabbits administered nitroglycerin by topical or dietary route during the period of organogenesis ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits were conducted with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively. No toxic effects on dams or fetuses were seen at any dose tested. An animal reproduction study was conducted in rats with nitroglycerin administered in the diet at levels up to 1% content (approximately 430 mg/kg/day) on days 6 to 15 of gestation. In offspring of the high-dose group, an increased but not statistically significant incidence of diaphragmatic hernias was noted together with decreased hyoid bone ossification. The latter finding probably reflects delayed development, thus indicating no clear evidence of a potential teratogenic effect of nitroglycerin. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of nitroglycerin in either human or animal milk following topical administration, or the effects of nitroglycerin on milk production. A publication describing 40 lactating patients who used nitroglycerin ointment to treat chronic anal fissures for varied durations did not report signs of adverse effects in their breastfed infants, however, the dosing regimens were not described. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the clinical need for nitroglycerin ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from nitroglycerin ointment or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin ointment in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin ointment did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Clinical data from the published literature indicate that the elderly demonstrate increased sensitivity to nitrates, which may be therapeutic but also manifest by more frequent or severe hypotension and related dizziness or fainting. Increased sensitivity may reflect the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Nitroglycerin toxicity is generally mild. The estimated adult oral lethal dose of nitroglycerin is 200 mg to 1,200 mg. Infants may be more susceptible to toxicity from nitroglycerin. Consultation with a poison center should be considered. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is not recommended. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin ointment overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate arterial PO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u2019,5\u2019-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Intra- anal application of nitroglycerin reduces sphincter tone and resting intra-anal pressure. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: Nitroglycerin is metabolized by a liver reductase enzyme to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, the two major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols are found in plasma. The contribution of metabolites to the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is unknown. The dinitrates are further metabolized to nonvasoactive mononitrates and ultimately to glycerol and carbon dioxide. Elimination: Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly with a mean elimination half-life of two to three minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow."

    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: In six healthy subjects, the average absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin applied to the anal canal as a 0.2% w/w ointment was approximately 50% of the 0.75 mg nitroglycerin dose. Distribution: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is about 3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: Nitroglycerin is metabolized by a liver reductase enzyme to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, the two major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3- dinitroglycerols are found in plasma. The contribution of metabolites to the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is unknown. The dinitrates are further metabolized to nonvasoactive mononitrates and ultimately to glycerol and carbon dioxide. Elimination: Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly with a mean elimination half-life of two to three minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis Animal carcinogenicity studies with topically applied nitroglycerin have not been performed. Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At the highest dose, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was 52% compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidence of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Mutagenesis Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay with Salmonella typhimurium . A similar mutation in this S. typhimurium was also reported with other NO donors. There was no evidence of clastogenic potential in multiple assays including a rodent dominant lethal assay, an in vitro Chinese Hamster Ovary assay that was conducted in the absence of metabolic activation, and several in vivo chromosomal aberration assays conducted in rats and dogs. Impairment of Fertility In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to approximately 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males."

Interaction with PDE5 Inhibitors Advise patient not to use nitroglycerin ointment with medications for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra (sildenafil), Levitra (vardenafil), and Cialis (tadalafil). These products have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of nitroglycerin ointment and other nitrate drugs. [see Contraindications(4)] Hypotension Advise patients that treatment with nitroglycerin ointment may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a lying or seated position. The effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol, since alcohol use contributes to hypotension. Advise patients to stand up from the supine or sitting position slowly. Headaches Advise patients that headaches sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin ointment. For patients who get these headaches, the headaches may indicate the activity of the drug. Tolerance to headaches develops. Advise patients that if they experience headache they should not alter the schedule of their nitroglycerin ointment treatment to avoid the occurrence of headache. An analgesic, such as acetaminophen, may be used to prevent or relieve the headaches. Dizziness Advise patients that dizziness has been reported as a side-effect of treatment with nitroglycerin ointment.

One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Product of USA Manufactured by: Natco Pharma Limited India. Manufactured for: DASH Pharmaceuticals LLC Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458, USA PATIENT INFORMATION Nitroglycerin (nye\u201d troe glis\u2019 er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, or you can call DASH Pharmaceuticals LLC at 201-786-6500.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION At the onset of an attack, administer onto or under the tongue. Repeat every 5 minutes as needed ( 2.1 ). Do up to three metered sprays within a 15-minute period. If chest pain persists, advise prompt medical attention ( 2.1 ). May be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack ( 2.1 ). 2.1 Recommended Dosage Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. 2.2 Priming The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17) ]. The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5. 2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use."

Avoid concomitant use ( 7.3 ) 7. 1 P DE -5- I nhibitors and sGC- S timulators Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7. 2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7. 3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric U se Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1 % solution), 1 \u2013 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean C max and t max were 1,041 pg/ml and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12,769 pg/ml * min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin : Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues and for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males.

One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3\u20195\u2019 monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 mg to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values Parameter 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC(0\u2013\u221e), min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t\u00bd, min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di-and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Mean peak 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2-and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1,000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1,058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Product of USA Manufactured by: Natco Pharma Limited India. Manufactured for: DASH Pharmaceuticals LLC Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458, USA PATIENT INFORMATION Nitroglycerin (nye\u201d troe glis\u2019 er in) Sublingual Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What is Nitroglycerin? Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: very recent heart attack severe anemia increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS\u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA\u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, tell your doctor if: You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. You are taking any diuretics (water pills). You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. You are taking aspirin. You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You are breastfeeding. How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, as this can lower your blood pressure. Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: headache vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) dizziness weakness heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position nausea and vomiting sweating paleness fainting flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How do I store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should be kept in the original glass container and tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Store nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at room temperature (between 68\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). General advice about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets Sometimes doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not included in the patient information leaflets. Only use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets the way your doctor told you to. Do not give nitroglycerin sublingual tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, or you can call DASH Pharmaceuticals LLC at 201-786-6500.

( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7.2 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 \u00d7 0.3 mg 1 \u00d7 0.6 mg Parameter Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination. Drug interactions Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F1 and F2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you. What are Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina. What is Angina? Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin ). You should not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you have the following conditions: \u2022 very recent heart attack \u2022 severe anemia \u2022 increased pressure in the head Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA \u00ae (sildenafil citrate), CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil), or LEVITRA \u00ae (vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure . Do not take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include riociguat, a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. What should I tell my doctor before taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Before using nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , tell your doctor if: \u2022 You are taking any medicines that are used to treat angina, heart failure, or an irregular heartbeat. \u2022 You are taking any medicines that reduce blood pressure. \u2022 You are taking any diuretics (water pills). \u2022 You are taking medicines that can cause dry mouth such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin), anticholinergic drugs, or any antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine). \u2022 You are taking ergotamine or similar drugs for migraine headaches. \u2022 You are taking aspirin. \u2022 You are taking any medicines for erectile dysfunction. \u2022 You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. \u2022 You are breastfeeding. How should I take Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? \u2022 Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . \u2022 You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. \u2022 One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. \u2022 The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved. \u2022 If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help. \u2022 Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain. \u2022 You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets . What should I avoid while taking Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? \u2022 Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk. \u2022 Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , as this can lower your blood pressure. \u2022 Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first. What are the possible side effects of Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets? Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may cause the following side effects: \u2022 headache \u2022 vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder) \u2022 dizziness \u2022 weakness \u2022 heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat) \u2022 low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 sweating \u2022 paleness \u2022 fainting \u2022 flushing (warm or red condition of your skin) \u2022 other skin reactions that may be severe Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION At the onset of an attack, administer onto or under the tongue. Repeat every 5 minutes as needed ( 2.1 ). Do up to three metered sprays within a 15-minute period. If chest pain persists, advise prompt medical attention ( 2.1 ). May be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack ( 2.1 ). 2.1 Recommended Dosage Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. 2.2 Priming The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming. 2.3 Administration Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17) ]. The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5. 2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives: Possible additive hypotensive effects. ( 7.2 ) Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use ( 7.3 ) 7. 1 P DE -5- I nhibitors and sGC- S timulators Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. 7. 2 Antihypertensives Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly. Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur. 7. 3 Ergotamine Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 \u2013 4% and 15 \u2013 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day for 13 days, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day for 11 days, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day for 13 days. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for nitroglycerin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from nitroglycerin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric u se Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) and younger (less than 65 years) patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1 % solution), 1 \u2013 2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use. As epinephrine is ineffective in reversing the severe hypotensive events associated with overdosage, it is not recommended for resuscitation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin are found in plasma. The mean elimination half-life of both 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is about 40 minutes. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess some pharmacological activity, whereas the glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are essentially inactive. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, with their nearly 8-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean C max and t max were 1,041 pg/ml and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12,769 pg/ml * min. The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. Drug interactions Aspirin : Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) : Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect."

Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52 % vs. 0 % in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52 % vs. 8 % in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in in vitro cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues and for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high- dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F 0 generation with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high- dose males. In this three-generation study there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Nitroglycerin is a stabilized sublingual compressed nitroglycerin tablet that contains 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, or 0.6 mg nitroglycerin USP; as well as calcium stearate powder, colloidal silicon dioxide, hydrogenated vegetable oil, lactose monohydrate, and pregelatinized starch. Nitroglycerin, an organic nitrate, is a vasodilating agent. The chemical name for nitroglycerin is 1, 2, 3 propanetriol trinitrate and the chemical structure is: Molecular weight: 227.09"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear. Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration. Mechanism of Action: Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation. Pharmacodynamics: Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin administration. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption: Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. Mean peak nitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at a mean time of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose (Table 1). Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (C max ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) increase dose-proportionally following 0.3 to 0.6 mg nitroglycerin. The absolute bioavailability of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin sublingual tablets is approximately 40% but tends to be variable due to factors influencing drug absorption, such as sublingual hydration and mucosal metabolism. Table 1 Parameter Mean Nitroglycerin (SD) Values 2 x 0.3 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets 1 x 0.6 mg Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets C max , ng/mL 2.3 (1.7) 2.1 (1.5) T max , min 6.4 (2.5) 7.2 (3.2) AUC (0\u2013\u221e) , min 14.9 (8.2) 14.9 (11.4) t \u00bd , min 2.8 (1.1) 2.6 (0.6) Distribution: The volume of distribution (V Area ) of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg. At plasma concentrations between 50 and 500 ng/mL, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 60% and 30%, respectively. Metabolism: A liver reductase enzyme is of primary importance in the metabolism of nitroglycerin to glycerol di- and mononitrate metabolites and ultimately to glycerol and organic nitrate. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls. In addition to nitroglycerin, 2 major metabolites 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin, are found in plasma. Mean peak 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin plasma concentrations occur at approximately 15 minutes postdose. The elimination half-life of 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin is 36 and 32 minutes, respectively. The 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerin metabolites have been reported to possess approximately 2% and 10%, respectively, of the pharmacological activity of nitroglycerin. Higher plasma concentrations of the dinitro metabolites, along with their nearly 10-fold longer elimination half-lives, may contribute significantly to the duration of pharmacologic effect. Glycerol mononitrate metabolites of nitroglycerin are biologically inactive. Elimination: Nitroglycerin plasma concentrations decrease rapidly, with a mean elimination half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. Half-life values range from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. Clearance (13.6 L/min) greatly exceeds hepatic blood flow. Metabolism is the primary route of drug elimination."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Sublingual nitroglycerin therapy is contraindicated in patients with early myocardial infarction, severe anemia, increased intracranial pressure, and those with a known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin. Administration of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride) since these compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The benefits of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal administration and should not be swallowed. Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance rarely occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. Several clinical trials of nitroglycerin patches or infusions in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated regimens that incorporated a 10- to 12-hour nitrate free interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal attacks during the nitrate free interval was observed in a small number of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at the end of the nitrate interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound, if it had occurred, would have been detected. Nitrate tolerance as a result of sublingual nitroglycerin administration is probably possible, but only in patients who maintain high continuous nitrate levels for more than 10 or 12 hours daily. Such use of sublingual nitroglycerin would entail administration of scores of tablets daily and is not recommended. The drug should be discontinued if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches. Information for Patients Nitroglycerin is a sublingual tablet and should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. If possible, patients should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and should use caution when returning to a standing position. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. Nitroglycerin may produce a burning or tingling sensation when administered sublingually; however, the ability to produce a burning or tingling sensation should not be considered a reliable method for determining the potency of the tablets. Headaches can sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness upon standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Nitroglycerin should be kept in the original glass container and must be tightly capped after each use to prevent loss of tablet potency. Drug Interactions Concomitant use of nitroglycerin with soluble guanylate cyclasestimulators is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin. Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of alteplase. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin during alteplase therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Nitrates may interfere with the Zlatkis-Zak color reaction, causing a false report of decreased serum cholesterol. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity. Pregnancy: Category B . Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. However, teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits with topically applied nitroglycerin ointment at dosages up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively revealed no toxic effects on dams or fetuses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitroglycerin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single sublingual nitroglycerin doses. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, others) and anticholinergic drugs may cause dry mouth and diminished salivary secretions. This may make dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin difficult. Increasing salivation with chewing gum or artificial saliva products may prove useful in aiding dissolution of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible. Administration of nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride). These compounds have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingually administered nitroglycerin have not been performed. Carcinogenicity potential of nitroglycerin was evaluated in rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years. Rats developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in males was 48% and in females was 33%, compared to 0% in untreated controls. Incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of, nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice. Nitroglycerin was mutagenic in Ames tests performed in 2 different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an in vivo dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, PO, or in ex vivo cytogenetic tests in rat and dog cells. In a 3-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for 6 months prior to mating of the F 0 generation, with treatment continuing through successive F 1 and F 2 generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body weight gain in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F 0 generation was seen. Infertility noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males. In this 3-generation study, there was no clear evidence of teratogenicity."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects: The effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin\u2019s capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; tachycardia; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient\u2019s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobinemia has been rarely reported in association with organic nitrates. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. If methemoglobinemia is present, intravenous administration of methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, may be required."

The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. During administration the patient should rest, preferably in the sitting position. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal failure."
