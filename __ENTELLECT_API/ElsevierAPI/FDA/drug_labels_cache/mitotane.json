      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended initial dose of LYSODREN is 2000 mg to 6000 mg orally, in three or four divided doses per day with food. ( 2.3 ) Titrate LYSODREN dose to achieve a plasma level of 14 to 20 mg/L. ( 2.3 ) LYSODREN is lipophilic and accumulates in adipose tissue. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating LYSODREN Before initiating LYSODREN, evaluate pelvic ultrasound in premenopausal women, liver functions tests and complete blood count [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5) ]. 2.2 General Precautions LYSODREN is a hazardous drug. Advise caregivers to wear disposable gloves when handling LYSODREN tablets [see References (15) and Storage and Handling (16) ]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Administration Recommended Dosage The recommended initial dose of LYSODREN is 2000 mg to 6000 mg orally, in three or four divided doses per day. Monitor mitotane plasma levels and increase the dose based on patient tolerance and clinical response incrementally to achieve a mitotane plasma level of 14 to 20 mg/L, or as tolerated. Consider monitoring mitotane plasma levels every 2 weeks after starting treatment and after each dose adjustment. The target plasma level is usually reached within a period of 3 to 5 months. Monitor mitotane plasma levels periodically (e.g., monthly). Severe neurotoxicity may occur with levels > 20 mg/L. Dose Adjustments, Monitoring and Discontinuation In case of mitotane plasma levels above 20 mg/L without toxicities, consider reducing the dose by 50 to 75%. Monitor mitotane plasma levels regularly (e.g., every two months) after discontinuation of treatment. Due to the prolonged half-life, significant levels may persist for weeks after cessation of therapy. LYSODREN is lipophilic and accumulates in adipose tissue. Despite maintaining a constant dose, mitotane levels may suddenly increase. Monitor mitotane plasma levels even when LYSODREN has been withheld as adipose tissue may continue to release mitotane [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Due to adipose tissue accumulation of mitotane, close monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is recommended in overweight patients and patients with recent weight loss. Administration Swallow LYSODREN tablets whole; do not crush, chew or split. Take LYSODREN with food. Timing of the dose relative to meals must be consistent. Administration with high fat food enhances absorption [See Clinical Pharmacology Section (12.3) ]. Do not take tablets showing signs of deterioration. Caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the tablets. Avoid exposure to crushed and/or broken tablets. If contact with crushed/broken tablets occurs, wash the contaminated skin immediately and thoroughly. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to take the next dose as scheduled. If a patient vomits after taking a dose, instruct the patient to take the next dose as scheduled. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dosage reduction for adverse reactions is to decrease the usual daily dose by 500 \u2013 1000 mg. Table 1 describes the dosage modifications for specific adverse reactions.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis: Temporarily withhold LYSODREN during shock, trauma, infection or adrenal insufficiency. Steroid replacement may be necessary. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity : Monitor behavioral and neurologic assessments and mitotane plasma levels at regular intervals. Mitotane plasma levels exceeding 20 mg/L are associated with a greater incidence of toxicity. Advise patients not to drive or operate hazardous machinery if experiencing CNS adverse reactions. (5.2) Ovarian Macrocysts in Premenopausal Women : Monitor pelvic ultrasound at baseline and at regular intervals. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity. (5.3) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver functions tests prior to starting LYSODREN, during dose titration and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose or permanently discontinue based on severity. (5.4) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting LYSODREN, during dose titration and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose or permanently discontinue based on severity. (5.5) Prolonged Bleeding Time : Prolonged bleeding time has occurred in patients treated with mitotane and this should be taken into account when surgery is considered. (5.6) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective, nonhormonal contraception. (5.8) 5.1 Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis Adrenal Insufficiency LYSODREN can cause adrenal insufficiency or worsen existing adrenal insufficiency in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. Monitor for both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid insufficiency and replace systemic corticosteroids accordingly. Due to increased steroid clearance and increase of steroid-binding protein, high-dose replacement therapy may be required and free cortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) should be monitored to adapt the systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Adrenal Crisis in the Setting of Shock, Severe Trauma or Infection LYSODREN can cause adrenal suppression and adrenal crisis in the setting of shock, severe trauma or infection. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of adrenal suppression and to contact their healthcare provider immediately if shock, trauma, infection, or adrenal suppression occurs. Withhold LYSODREN before planned surgeries. Temporarily withhold LYSODREN during shock, trauma, infection or adrenal suppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Provide supportive care and administer systemic corticosteroids until recovery. 5.2 Central Nervous System Toxicity LYSODREN can cause central nervous system toxicity, including sedation, lethargy, and vertigo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor behavioral and neurologic assessments and mitotane plasma levels at regular intervals. Mitotane plasma levels exceeding 20 mg/L are associated with a greater incidence of toxicity. In cases of cognitive dysfunction, thyroid function should be evaluated as mitotane may induce hypothyroidism. LYSODREN can impair the ability to drive and operate machinery. Advise patients not to drive or operate hazardous machinery if they are experiencing CNS adverse reactions. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Ovarian Macrocysts in Premenopausal Women LYSODREN can cause non-malignant, multiple and bilateral ovarian macrocysts in premenopausal women. Ovarian macrocysts can be symptomatic (e.g., pelvic pain or discomfort, or menstrual irregularities) or asymptomatic. Complications from these cysts, including adnexal torsion and hemorrhagic cyst rupture, have occurred. Advise female patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately for gynecological symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor pelvic imaging in premenopausal females at baseline and in regular intervals during treatment with LYSODREN. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity LYSODREN can cause hepatoxicity, including liver injury or failure. Monitor liver function tests prior to starting treatment with LYSODREN, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Isolated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) elevation may occur. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity of hepatoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.5 Hematologic toxicity LYSODREN can cause leukopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Monitor complete blood counts including neutrophil count prior to starting treatment with LYSODREN, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity of cytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.6 Prolonged Bleeding Time LYSODREN can cause platelet function disorders due to abnormal adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. Some patients may have a prolonged bleeding time, while others may have a normal bleeding time. Routine in vitro bleeding time is not suitable to detect this platelet defect and to assess bleeding risk. Perform ADP-inducted platelet aggregometry testing prior to surgery or dental procedures to determine mitotane-induced bleeding risk. For patients with prolonged bleeding time, withhold or reduce the dose of LYSODREN as clinically indicated. 5.7 Hormone binding protein Mitotane has been shown to increase plasma levels of hormone binding proteins (e.g., sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)). This should be taken into account when interpreting the results of hormonal assays and may result in gynecomastia. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity LYSODREN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm births and early pregnancy loss, can occur in patients exposed to mitotane during pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception, during treatment with LYSODREN and after discontinuation of treatment for as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable, since LYSODREN can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

(8.2) Hepatic Impairment :LYSODREN is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels frequently and modify the dosage as needed. (8.6) Renal Impairment : LYSODREN is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels frequently and modify the dosage as needed. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary LYSODREN can cause fetal harm. Limited postmarketing cases report preterm births and early pregnancy loss in women treated with LYSODREN during pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mitotane. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mitotane is excreted in human milk; however, the effect of LYSODREN on the breastfed child, or on milk production is unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LYSODREN and after discontinuation of treatment for as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LYSODREN [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception LYSODREN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with LYSODREN and after discontinuation of therapy for as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . LYSODREN can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interaction (7.2) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established. Based on published case reports, mitotane may negatively impact neuro-psychological development (e.g., motor and speech delay, memory impairment) in children and adolescents. In cases of cognitive dysfunction, thyroid function should be evaluated as mitotane may induce hypothyroidism. Other effects of mitotane observed in pediatric patients that are cited in medical literature or in a pharmacovigilance database include growth delay and estrogenic-like effects such as uterine bleeding, breast development in females and gynecomastia in males. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of LYSODREN did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the older and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an older patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Mitotane is metabolized through the liver and mitotane plasma levels may increase if liver function is impaired. Because of the increased risk of adverse reactions in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels more frequently and modify the dosage as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. LYSODREN is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Mitotane is eliminated through the kidney and mitotane plasma levels may increase if renal function is impaired. Because of the increased risk of adverse reactions in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels more frequently and modify the dosage as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ].

Withhold LYSODREN as clinically indicated for signs or symptoms of toxicity. LYSODREN is lipophilic and has a prolonged half-life; therefore, it may take weeks for plasma levels to decrease. LYSODREN is not likely to be dialyzable. Increase the frequency of mitotane plasma level monitoring, as clinically indicated."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic agent with an unknown mechanism of action. Mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids and directly suppresses the adrenal cortex. A reduction in 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in the absence of decreased corticosteroid levels and increased formation of 6-\u03b2-hydroxycortisol have been reported. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Mitotane exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of LYSODREN, 40% of the dose is absorbed. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of mitotane (LYSODREN) is not known. High fat food: Data with various mitotane formulations suggest that administration with high fat food enhances absorption of mitotane. Distribution Mitotane is found in most tissues of the body; however, fat is the primary site of distribution. Elimination Following discontinuation of mitotane, the plasma terminal half-life ranges from 18 to 159 days (median 53 days). Metabolism Mitotane is converted to a water-soluble metabolite. Mitotane metabolism includes hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism. Mitotane is metabolized to 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl) acetic acid (o,p'-DDA), as the major circulating metabolite. Excretion No unchanged mitotane is found in urine or bile. Approximately 10% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as a water-soluble metabolite. A variable amount of metabolite (1%-17%) is excreted in the bile. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mitotane have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment or patients with renal impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Mitotane on Other Drugs Midazolam: Coadministration of a single dose of midazolam (CYP3A substrate) in patients who received LYSODREN resulted in decreased midazolam concentrations relative to patients who had not received LYSODREN. Spironolactone : The effect of concomitant spironolactone on the pharmacokinetics of mitotane has not been studied; however, patients exhibited significantly lower mitotane levels compared to those who did not receive concomitant spironolactone despite receiving higher mitotane doses."

      "MEDICATION GUIDE LYSODREN\u00ae (LY-SO-DREN) (mitotane) tablets, for oral use What is the most important information I should know about LYSODREN? LYSODREN can cause serious side effects including: Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis. Adrenal Insufficiency. LYSODREN can cause your adrenal glands to stop making enough corticosteroid hormones (adrenal insufficiency) or make this problem worse in people with cancer of the adrenal glands (adrenocortical carcinoma). Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop, reduce your dose, or permanently stop treatment with LYSODREN if you develop adrenal insufficiency during treatment. Adrenal Crisis. LYSODREN can cause your adrenal glands to suddenly stop making enough corticosteroid hormones (adrenal crisis). You are at increased risk for developing adrenal crisis if you experience shock, severe injury, or infection during treatment with LYSODREN. Adrenal crisis may lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get an injury, infection, or other illness during treatment with LYSODREN. Your healthcare provider will temporarily stop LYSODREN if shock, severe injury, or infections happen during treatment. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any planned surgery. Your healthcare provider will check your levels of corticosteroid hormones during treatment and may give you corticosteroid medicine if you develop adrenal gland problems. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of adrenal gland problems, including: severe weakness confusion pain in the lower back and legs stomach (abdominal) pain nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea feeling lightheaded or dizzy passing out feeling very tired decreased appetite weight loss areas of darkened skin craving salt low blood sugar feeling irritable or depressed hair loss See \"What are the possible side effects of LYSODREN?\" for more information about side effects. What is LYSODREN? LYSODREN is a prescription medicine used to treat people with cancer of the adrenal glands (adrenocortical carcinoma) that is functional (when the adrenal glands make more corticosteroid hormone than normal) or nonfunctional (when the adrenal glands make less corticosteroid hormone than normal) and the cancer cannot be removed by surgery.

( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating LYSODREN Before initiating LYSODREN, evaluate pelvic ultrasound in premenopausal women, liver functions tests and complete blood count [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5) ]. 2.2 General Precautions LYSODREN is a hazardous drug. Advise caregivers to wear disposable gloves when handling LYSODREN tablets [see References (15) and Storage and Handling (16) ]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Administration Recommended Dosage The recommended initial dose of LYSODREN is 2000 mg to 6000 mg orally, in three or four divided doses per day. Monitor mitotane plasma levels and increase the dose based on patient tolerance and clinical response incrementally to achieve a mitotane plasma level of 14 to 20 mg/L, or as tolerated. Consider monitoring mitotane plasma levels every 2 weeks after starting treatment and after each dose adjustment. The target plasma level is usually reached within a period of 3 to 5 months. Monitor mitotane plasma levels periodically (e.g., monthly). Severe neurotoxicity may occur with levels > 20 mg/L. Dose Adjustments, Monitoring and Discontinuation In case of mitotane plasma levels above 20 mg/L without toxicities, consider reducing the dose by 50 to 75%. Monitor mitotane plasma levels regularly (e.g., every two months) after discontinuation of treatment. Due to the prolonged half-life, significant levels may persist for weeks after cessation of therapy. LYSODREN is lipophilic and accumulates in adipose tissue. Despite maintaining a constant dose, mitotane levels may suddenly increase. Monitor mitotane plasma levels even when LYSODREN has been withheld as adipose tissue may continue to release mitotane [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Due to adipose tissue accumulation of mitotane, close monitoring of mitotane plasma levels is recommended in overweight patients and patients with recent weight loss. Administration Swallow LYSODREN tablets whole; do not crush, chew or split. Take LYSODREN with food. Timing of the dose relative to meals must be consistent. Administration with high fat food enhances absorption [See Clinical Pharmacology Section (12.3) ]. Do not take tablets showing signs of deterioration. Caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the tablets. Avoid exposure to crushed and/or broken tablets. If contact with crushed/broken tablets occurs, wash the contaminated skin immediately and thoroughly. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to take the next dose as scheduled. If a patient vomits after taking a dose, instruct the patient to take the next dose as scheduled. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dosage reduction for adverse reactions is to decrease the usual daily dose by 500 \u2013 1000 mg.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis: Temporarily withhold LYSODREN during shock, trauma, infection or adrenal insufficiency. Steroid replacement may be necessary. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity : Monitor behavioral and neurologic assessments and mitotane plasma levels at regular intervals. Mitotane plasma levels exceeding 20 mg/L are associated with a greater incidence of toxicity. Advise patients not to drive or operate hazardous machinery if experiencing CNS adverse reactions. (5.2) Ovarian Macrocysts in Premenopausal Women : Monitor pelvic ultrasound at baseline and at regular intervals. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity. (5.3) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver functions tests prior to starting LYSODREN, during dose titration and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose or permanently discontinue based on severity. (5.4) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting LYSODREN, during dose titration and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose or permanently discontinue based on severity. (5.5) Prolonged Bleeding Time : Prolonged bleeding time has occurred in patients treated with mitotane and this should be taken into account when surgery is considered. (5.6) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective, nonhormonal contraception. (5.8) 5.1 Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis Adrenal Insufficiency LYSODREN can cause adrenal insufficiency or worsen existing adrenal insufficiency in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. Monitor for both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid insufficiency and replace systemic corticosteroids accordingly. Due to increased steroid clearance and increase of steroid-binding protein, high-dose replacement therapy may be required and free cortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) should be monitored to adapt the systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Adrenal Crisis in the Setting of Shock, Severe Trauma or Infection LYSODREN can cause adrenal suppression and adrenal crisis in the setting of shock, severe trauma or infection. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of adrenal suppression and to contact their healthcare provider immediately if shock, trauma, infection, or adrenal suppression occurs. Withhold LYSODREN before planned surgeries. Temporarily withhold LYSODREN during shock, trauma, infection or adrenal suppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Provide supportive care and administer systemic corticosteroids until recovery. 5.2 Central Nervous System Toxicity LYSODREN can cause central nervous system toxicity, including sedation, lethargy, and vertigo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor behavioral and neurologic assessments and mitotane plasma levels at regular intervals. Mitotane plasma levels exceeding 20 mg/L are associated with a greater incidence of toxicity. In cases of cognitive dysfunction, thyroid function should be evaluated as mitotane may induce hypothyroidism. LYSODREN can impair the ability to drive and operate machinery. Advise patients not to drive or operate hazardous machinery if they are experiencing CNS adverse reactions. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Ovarian Macrocysts in Premenopausal Women LYSODREN can cause non-malignant, multiple and bilateral ovarian macrocysts in premenopausal women. Ovarian macrocysts can be symptomatic (e.g., pelvic pain or discomfort, or menstrual irregularities) or asymptomatic. Complications from these cysts, including adnexal torsion and hemorrhagic cyst rupture, have occurred. Advise female patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately for gynecological symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor pelvic imaging in premenopausal females at baseline and in regular intervals during treatment with LYSODREN. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity LYSODREN can cause hepatoxicity, including liver injury or failure. Monitor liver function tests prior to starting treatment with LYSODREN, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Isolated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) elevation may occur. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity of hepatoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.5 Hematologic toxicity LYSODREN can cause leukopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Monitor complete blood counts including neutrophil count prior to starting treatment with LYSODREN, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity of cytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.6 Prolonged Bleeding Time LYSODREN can cause platelet function disorders due to abnormal adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. Some patients may have a prolonged bleeding time, while others may have a normal bleeding time. Routine in vitro bleeding time is not suitable to detect this platelet defect and to assess bleeding risk. Perform ADP-inducted platelet aggregometry testing prior to surgery or dental procedures to determine mitotane-induced bleeding risk. For patients with prolonged bleeding time, withhold or reduce the dose of LYSODREN as clinically indicated. 5.7 Hormone binding protein Mitotane has been shown to increase plasma levels of hormone binding proteins (e.g., sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)). This should be taken into account when interpreting the results of hormonal assays and may result in gynecomastia. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity LYSODREN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm births and early pregnancy loss, can occur in patients exposed to mitotane during pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception, during treatment with LYSODREN and after discontinuation of treatment for as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable, since LYSODREN can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

(8.2) Hepatic Impairment :LYSODREN is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels frequently and modify the dosage as needed. (8.6) Renal Impairment : LYSODREN is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels frequently and modify the dosage as needed. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary LYSODREN can cause fetal harm. Limited postmarketing cases report preterm births and early pregnancy loss in women treated with LYSODREN during pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mitotane. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Mitotane is excreted in human milk; however, the effect of LYSODREN on the breastfed child, or on milk production is unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LYSODREN and after discontinuation of treatment for as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LYSODREN [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .

LYSODREN can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interaction (7.2) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established. Based on published case reports, mitotane may negatively impact neuro-psychological development (e.g., motor and speech delay, memory impairment) in children and adolescents. In cases of cognitive dysfunction, thyroid function should be evaluated as mitotane may induce hypothyroidism. Other effects of mitotane observed in pediatric patients that are cited in medical literature or in a pharmacovigilance database include growth delay and estrogenic-like effects such as uterine bleeding, breast development in females and gynecomastia in males. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of LYSODREN did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the older and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an older patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Mitotane is metabolized through the liver and mitotane plasma levels may increase if liver function is impaired. Because of the increased risk of adverse reactions in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels more frequently and modify the dosage as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. LYSODREN is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Mitotane is eliminated through the kidney and mitotane plasma levels may increase if renal function is impaired. Because of the increased risk of adverse reactions in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, monitor mitotane plasma levels more frequently and modify the dosage as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ].

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic agent with an unknown mechanism of action. Mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids and directly suppresses the adrenal cortex. A reduction in 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in the absence of decreased corticosteroid levels and increased formation of 6-\u03b2-hydroxycortisol have been reported. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Mitotane exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response have not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of LYSODREN, 40% of the dose is absorbed. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of mitotane (LYSODREN) is not known. High fat food: Data with various mitotane formulations suggest that administration with high fat food enhances absorption of mitotane. Distribution Mitotane is found in most tissues of the body; however, fat is the primary site of distribution. Elimination Following discontinuation of mitotane, the plasma terminal half-life ranges from 18 to 159 days (median 53 days). Metabolism Mitotane is converted to a water-soluble metabolite. Mitotane metabolism includes hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism. Mitotane is metabolized to 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl) acetic acid (o,p'-DDA), as the major circulating metabolite. Excretion No unchanged mitotane is found in urine or bile. Approximately 10% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as a water-soluble metabolite. A variable amount of metabolite (1%-17%) is excreted in the bile. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mitotane have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment or patients with renal impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Mitotane on Other Drugs Midazolam: Coadministration of a single dose of midazolam (CYP3A substrate) in patients who received LYSODREN resulted in decreased midazolam concentrations relative to patients who had not received LYSODREN. Spironolactone : The effect of concomitant spironolactone on the pharmacokinetics of mitotane has not been studied; however, patients exhibited significantly lower mitotane levels compared to those who did not receive concomitant spironolactone despite receiving higher mitotane doses."

Elimination Following discontinuation of mitotane, the plasma terminal half-life ranges from 18 to 159 days (median 53 days). Metabolism Mitotane is converted to a water-soluble metabolite. Mitotane metabolism includes hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism. Mitotane is metabolized to 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl) acetic acid (o,p'-DDA), as the major circulating metabolite. Excretion No unchanged mitotane is found in urine or bile. Approximately 10% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as a water-soluble metabolite. A variable amount of metabolite (1%-17%) is excreted in the bile. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of mitotane have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment or patients with renal impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Mitotane on Other Drugs Midazolam: Coadministration of a single dose of midazolam (CYP3A substrate) in patients who received LYSODREN resulted in decreased midazolam concentrations relative to patients who had not received LYSODREN. Spironolactone : The effect of concomitant spironolactone on the pharmacokinetics of mitotane has not been studied; however, patients exhibited significantly lower mitotane levels compared to those who did not receive concomitant spironolactone despite receiving higher mitotane doses."
