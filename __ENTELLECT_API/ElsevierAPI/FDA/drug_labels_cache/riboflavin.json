      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. M ultivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.5 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm, and for children 6 years of age and above where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.25 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6years of age in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

The safety of EPIOXA HD and EPIOXA in the epithelium-on corneal collagen cross-linking procedure with UV-A irradiation and supplemental oxygen was evaluated in two randomized, parallel-group, sham procedure/vehicle-controlled trials. Study eyes were randomized in a 2:1 treatment allocation to receive corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) or sham procedure/vehicle control at the baseline visit. In both trials, CXL-treated eyes were followed for 12 months. Safety data were obtained from a total of 389 CXL-treated eyes. The most commonly reported adverse reaction in CXL-treated eyes was conjunctival hyperaemia (31%). Other adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 25% of CXL-treated eyes included: corneal opacity (haze), photophobia, punctate keratitis, eye pain, eye irritation, lacrimation increased, corneal epithelium defect, eyelid oedema, corneal striae, visual acuity reduced, dry eye, and anterior chamber flare."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two prospective, randomized, parallel-group, sham procedure/vehicle-controlled trials (Study 1 [NCT03442751] and Study 2 [NCT05759559]) were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of epithelium-on corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) using riboflavin 5'-phosphate ophthalmic solutions with UV-A irradiation and supplemental oxygen in patients with keratoconus. In both trials, eligible eyes were randomized to receive CXL treatment or sham procedure/vehicle control in a 2:1 treatment allocation at the baseline visit. Aphakic patients and pseudophakic patients without a UV-blocking intraocular lens were excluded. Both eyes of a patient could be enrolled in the trial; however, one eye was treated first, and the second eye was treated between 1 week and 3 months after the first eye. Eyes were evaluated at 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. In Study 1, eyes randomized to sham procedure/vehicle control were permitted to receive CXL treatment after month 6 and were followed an additional 6 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was at month 6 post-treatment and the secondary efficacy endpoint was at month 12 post-treatment. In Study 2, the primary efficacy endpoint was at month 12 post-treatment and the secondary efficacy endpoint was at month 6 post-treatment. In Study 1, a total of 280 eyes of 201 patients were randomized into the trial, of which 279 eyes were treated: 189 eyes received CXL treatment and 90 eyes initially received sham procedure/vehicle control. A statistically significant treatment effect was demonstrated at month 6, based on the difference in change from baseline in maximum corneal curvature (K max ) between the CXL treatment group and sham procedure/vehicle control group ( Table 1 ).

Older patients (\u2265 29 years) did not experience improvement at month 6 in either arm. In Study 2, a total of 312 eyes of 208 patients were randomized into the trial, of which 312 eyes were treated: 200 eyes received CXL treatment and 112 eyes received sham procedure/vehicle control.

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Vitafol \u00ae Fe + prenatal supplement is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components or color additives. Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron supplementation is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)."

      "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS: This product is intended for use as directed by your healthcare provider. Do not share with others. Vitafol \u00ae Fe + must be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to soy. Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Iodine should be used with caution in patients with an overactive thyroid. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid Overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children. DRUG INTERACTIONS Medications for an overactive thyroid (anti-thyroid drugs) used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may lead to hypothyroidism. Medications for hypertension used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may increase potassium levels in blood. High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs; carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid. Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be counseled to disclose all medical conditions, including use of all medications, vitamins and supplements, pregnancy, and breast-feeding. PEDIATRIC USE Not for pediatric use."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.25 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6years of age in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS Vitafol \u00ae Ultra contains soy and should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to soy. Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Iodine should be used with caution in patients with an overactive thyroid. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Avoid Overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children. Drug Interactions Medications for an overactive thyroid (anti-thyroid drugs) used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may lead to hypothyroidism. Medications for hypertension used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may increase potassium. High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs; carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbitol, valproic acid. Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled to disclose all medical conditions, including use of all medications, vitamins and supplements, pregnancy, and breast-feeding."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.25 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6years of age in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

INFUVITE PEDIATRIC Pharmacy Bulk Package : \u2022 Use only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area). \u2022 Transfer the contents of Vial 2 (10 mL of solution) into the contents of Vial 1 (40 mL of solution). The mixed solution (50 mL) will provide thirty-three 1.5 mL single doses, fifteen 3.25 mL single doses or ten 5 mL single doses. \u2022 Each bulk vial closure shall be penetrated only one time with a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows measured dispensing of the contents. \u2022 Once the closure system has been penetrated, complete dispensing from the pharmacy bulk vial should be completed within 4 hours. The mixed solution may be refrigerated and stored for up to 4 hours. \u2022 Discard unused portion. \u2022 Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. \u2022 Add one dose directly to at least 100 mL of intravenous dextrose or saline solution for each patient. \u2022 After INFUVITE PEDIATRIC is diluted in an intravenous infusion, refrigerate the resulting solution unless it is to be used immediately, and use the solution within 24 hours after dilution. \u2022 Minimize exposure to light because some of the vitamins in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, particularly A, D and riboflavin, are light sensitive. 2.4 Monitoring Vitamin Blood Levels Blood vitamin concentrations should be monitored to ensure maintenance of adequate levels, particularly in patients receiving parenteral multivitamins as the only source of vitamins for long periods of time. 2.5 Drug Incompatibilities \u2022 INFUVITE PEDIATRIC is not physically compatible with moderately alkaline solutions such as a sodium bicarbonate solution and other alkaline drugs such as acetazolamide sodium, aminophylline, ampicillin sodium, tetracycline HCl and chlorothiazide sodium. \u2022 Folic acid is unstable in the presence of calcium salts such as calcium gluconate. \u2022 Vitamin A and thiamine in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may react with bisulfite solutions such as sodium bisulfite or vitamin K bisulfite. \u2022 Do not add INFUVITE PEDIATRIC directly to intravenous fat emulsions. \u2022 Consult appropriate references for additional listings of physical and chemical compatibility of solutions and drugs with the vitamin infusion when needed. If incompatibilities are identified, avoid admixture or Y-site administration with vitamin solutions."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Aluminum Toxicity: For at risk patients (renal failure or those with prolonged therapy), consider periodic monitoring of aluminum levels ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions: To thiamine may occur ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypervitaminosis A : Patients with renal failure or liver disease may be at higher risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin: Monitor INR ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interferes with Megaloblastic Anemia Diagnosis: Avoid during testing for this disorder ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses: Monitor blood vitamin concentrations ( 5.6 ) \u2022 False Negative Urine Glucose Tests: Due to vitamin C ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Risk of Vitamin E Toxicity: Additional oral and parenteral vitamin E may result in elevated vitamin E blood concentrations in infants ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Low Vitamin A Levels: Monitor vitamin A levels ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome: Due to polysorbates ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Aluminum Toxicity INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solution, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. To prevent aluminum toxicity periodically monitor aluminum levels with prolonged parenteral administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. 5.2 Allergic Reactions to Thiamine Allergic reactions such as urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing and angioedema have been reported following intravenous administration of thiamine, which is found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. There have been rare reports of anaphylaxis following intravenous doses of thiamine. No fatal anaphylaxis associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported. 5.3. Hypervitaminosis A Hypervitaminosis A, manifested by nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision has been reported in patients with renal failure receiving 1.5 mg/day retinol and in patients with liver disease. Therefore, supplementation of renal failure patients and patients with liver disease with vitamin A, an ingredient found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, should be undertaken with caution [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) ]. Blood levels of Vitamin A should be monitored periodically. 5.4 Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains Vitamin K which may decrease the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are on warfarin anticoagulant therapy receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC monitor blood levels of prothrombin/INR to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted. 5.5 Interference with Diagnosis of Megaloblastic Anemia INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains folic acid and cyanocobalamin which can mask serum deficiencies of folic acid and cyanocobalamin in patients with megaloblastic anemia. Avoid the use of INFUVITE PEDIATRICS in patients with suspected or diagnosed megaloblastic anemia prior to blood sampling for the detection of the folic acid and cyanocobalamin deficiencies. 5.6 Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins such as with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 5.7 Interference with Urine Glucose Testing INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose results. 5.8 Vitamin E Overdose in Infants Receiving Additional Vitamin E Additional vitamin E supplementations of patients receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may result in elevated blood concentrations of vitamin E and potential vitamin E toxicity in infants. Avoid additional oral or parental doses of vitamin E in infants. Daily dose of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains adequate concentrations of vitamin E required to achieve normal blood levels of vitamin E. 5.9 Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels Lower vitamin A concentrations may occur after administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC due to the adherence of Vitamin A to plastic. Monitor blood vitamin A concentrations periodically. Additional administration of therapeutic doses of vitamin A may be required, especially in low-birth weight infants. 5.10 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome in Low-Birth Weight Infants E-Ferol syndrome manifested by thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, ascites, hypotension and metabolic acidosis has been reported in low-birth weight infants following administration of polysorbates which are found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. No E-Ferol syndrome associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of interactions between vitamins and drugs have been reported. The following are examples of these types of interactions. Effect of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC on other drugs : \u2022 Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin may reduce the activity of bleomycin ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Levodopa: Pyridoxine may decrease blood levels of levodopa and levodopa efficacy may decrease ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Phenytoin: Folic acid may decrease phenytoin blood levels and increase risk of seizure activity ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease response to methotrexate ( 7.1 ) Effects of other drugs on INFUVITE PEDIATRIC: \u2022 Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements ( 7.2 ). \u2022 Phenytoin: May decrease folic acid concentrations ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drug Interactions Affecting Co-administered Drugs Warfarin : Vitamin K, a component of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, antagonizes the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are co-administered warfarin and INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood levels of prothrombin/INR should be monitored to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Antibiotics : Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. Bleomycin : Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin in vitro , thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced. Levodopa : Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood levels of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy. Phenytoin : Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity. Methotrexate : Folic acid may decrease a patient\u2019s response to methotrexate therapy. 7.2 Drug Interactions Affecting Vitamin Levels Hydralazine, Isoniazid : Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements. Phenytoin : Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. M ultivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.5 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm, and for children 6 years of age and above where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. M ultivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.5 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm, and for children 6 years of age and above where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets provide 1.0 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 6-16 years of age in areas where the water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm. Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite. The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva. eq"
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, C and D. Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.25 mg also provides fluoride for caries prophylaxis. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3-6 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.25 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a dose of 1 mL of Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.25 mg (See Dosage and Administration ). Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.25 mg supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C and D to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS As in the case of all medications, keep out of reach of children."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. When prescribing vitamin fluoride products: Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other medications and swallowed toothpaste. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis. Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.25 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.) Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule: If fluoride level is unknown, drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed. For testing of fluoride content, contact the local or state health department. All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history. Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex. Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing, unerupted teeth. Fluoride supplements require long-term compliance on a daily basis."

Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress. Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (such as DHA and EPA) per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and International Normalized Ratio (INR). Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired predisposition to bleeding."

      "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathryroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. M ultivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.5 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm, and for children 6 years of age and above where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets provide 0.25 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6years of age in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS STROVITE \u00ae ONE is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components. Folic Acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)."
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "WARNING/PRECAUTIONS Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children."

    "precautions": [
      "Drug Interactions High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hyper-calcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.

Pediatric Use Not recommended for pediatric use."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS Select-OB+DHA \u00ae should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to soy. Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased rick of heart disease can occur. Prolonged use of iron slats may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children. Drug Interactions High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite. The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva. eq"
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, C and D. Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride and Iron 0.25 mg also provides fluoride for caries prophylaxis. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3-6 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.25 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a dose of 1 mL of Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.25 mg (See Dosage and Administration ). Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride and Iron 0.25 mg supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C and D to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING S As in the case of all medications, keep out of reach of children."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTION S The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. When prescribing vitamin fluoride products: Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other medications and swallowed toothpaste. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis. Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride Iron 0.25 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.) Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule: If fluoride level is unknown, drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed. For testing of fluoride content, contact the local or state health department. All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history. Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex. Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing, unerupted teeth. Fluoride supplements require long-term compliance on a daily basis."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite . The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets provide 1.0 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 6-16 years of age in areas where the water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm. Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride 1.0 mg Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Using topical anesthesia, debride the epithelium to a diameter of approximately 9 mm using standard aseptic technique. Post epithelial debridement, instill 1 drop of PHOTREXA VISCOUS topically on the eye every 2 minutes for 30 minutes. At the end of the 30 minute soaking period, examine the eye under the slit lamp for the presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber. If the yellow flare is not detected, instill 1 drop of PHOTREXA VISCOUS every 2 minutes for an additional 2 to 3 drops and recheck for the presence of a yellow flare. This process can be repeated as necessary. Once the yellow flare is observed, perform ultrasound pachymetry. If corneal thickness is less than 400 microns, instill 2 drops of PHOTREXA every 5 to 10 seconds until the corneal thickness increases to at least 400 microns. Irradiation should not be performed unless this 400 micron threshold is met and the yellow flare is seen. Irradiate the eye for 30 continuous minutes at 3mW/cm 2 at a wavelength of 365 nm, centered over the cornea, using the KXL System as per the instructions in the KXL manual. During irradiation, continue topical instillation of PHOTREXA VISCOUS onto the eye every 2 minutes for the 30 minute irradiation period. For topical ophthalmic use. Do not inject. Single use PHOTREXA VISCOUS and PHOTREXA only. Discard syringe(s) after use. PHOTREXA VISCOUS and PHOTREXA are for use with the KXL System only. PLEASE REFER TO THE KXL OPERATOR\u2019S MANUAL FOR SPECIFIC DEVICE INSTRUCTIONS. Debride the epithelium using standard aseptic technique using topical anesthesia ( 2 ). Then instill 1 drop of PHOTREXA VISCOUS topically on the eye every 2 minutes for 30 minutes ( 2 ). After 30 minutes, examine the eye under slit lamp for presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber. If flare is not detected, instill 1 drop of PHOTREXA VISCOUS every 2 minutes for an additional 2 to 3 drops and recheck for yellow flare. Repeat as necessary ( 2 ). Once flare is observed, perform ultrasound pachymetry. If corneal thickness is less than 400 microns, instill 2 drops of PHOTREXA every 5 to 10 seconds until the corneal thickness increases to at least 400 microns ( 2 ). Irradiation should not be performed unless this 400 micron threshold is met and the yellow flare is seen ( 2 ). Irradiate the eye for 30 minutes at 3mW/cm 2 using the KXL System as per the instructions in the KXL manual. During irradiation, continue topical instillation of PHOTREXA VISCOUS onto the eye every 2 minutes for the 30 minute irradiation period ( 2 ). Refer to the KXL Operator\u2019s manual for specific device instructions ( 2 )."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Ulcerative keratitis [ Warnings and Precautions (5) ] In progressive keratoconus patients, the most common ocular adverse reactions in any CXL-treated eye were corneal opacity (haze), punctate keratitis, corneal striae, corneal epithelium defect, eye pain, reduced visual acuity, and blurred vision ( 6.1 ). In corneal ectasia patients, the most common ocular adverse reactions were corneal opacity (haze), corneal epithelium defect, corneal striae, dry eye, eye pain, punctate keratitis, photophobia, reduced visual acuity, and blurred vision ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avedro at 1-844-528-3376 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of the corneal collagen cross-linking procedure was evaluated in 3 randomized, parallel-group, open-label, sham-controlled trials; patients were followed up for 12 months. Study 1 enrolled patients with progressive keratoconus or corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Study 2 enrolled only patients with progressive keratoconus, and Study 3 enrolled only patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. In each study, only one eye of each patient was designated as the study eye. Study eyes were randomized to receive one of the two study treatments (CXL or sham) at the baseline visit and were followed up at Day 1, Week 1, and Months 1, 3, 6, and 12. At Month 3 or later, sham study eyes and non-study eyes had the option of receiving CXL treatment, and were followed-up for 12 months from the time of receiving CXL treatment. Each CXL treated eye received a single course of CXL treatment only. Safety data were obtained from: 193 randomized CXL study eyes (102 keratoconus, 91 corneal ectasia), 191 control eyes, and 319 nonrandomized CXL non-study eyes (191 keratoconus, 128 corneal ectasia). Overall, 512 eyes (293 keratoconus, 219 corneal ectasia) in 364 patients received CXL treatment. In progressive keratoconus patients, the most common ocular adverse reactions in any CXL-treated eye were corneal opacity (haze), punctate keratitis, corneal striae, corneal epithelium defect, eye pain, reduced visual acuity, and blurred vision ( Table 1 ). In corneal ectasia patients, the most common ocular adverse reactions were corneal opacity (haze), corneal epithelium defect, corneal striae, dry eye, eye pain, punctate keratitis, photophobia, reduced visual acuity, and blurred vision. These events are expected sequelae following epithelial corneal debridement and occurred at a higher incidence than observed in control patients, who did not undergo debridement or exposure to UVA light ( Table 1 ). Adverse events reported in non-study, non-randomized CXL treated were similar in terms of preferred terms and frequency to those seen in randomized study eyes. The majority of adverse events reported resolved during the first month, while events such as corneal epithelium defect, corneal striae, punctate keratitis, photophobia, dry eye and eye pain, and decreased visual acuity took up to 6 months to resolve and corneal opacity or haze took up to 12 months to resolve. In 1-2% of patients, corneal epithelium defect, corneal edema, corneal opacity and corneal scar continued to be observed at 12 months. In 6% of corneal ectasia patients, corneal opacity continued to be observed at 12 months.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Riboflavin 5\u2019-phosphate sodium (Vitamin B2) is the precursor of two coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide, which catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions involved in a number of metabolic pathways. Under the conditions used for corneal collagen cross-linking, riboflavin 5\u2018-phosphate functions as a photoenhancer and generates singlet oxygen which is responsible for the cross-linking."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to determine the carcinogenic potential of photoexcited riboflavin. Photoexcited riboflavin has been shown to be genotoxic in the Ames Salmonella reverse mutation assay and in the SOS/umu test system. The genotoxicity of riboflavin, in the absence of photoexcitation has been examined in vitro in bacterial reverse mutation assays, sister chromatid exchange assay, chromosomal aberration assays and in vivo in a mouse micronucleus study. The overall weight of evidence indicates that riboflavin, in the absence of photoexcitation, is not genotoxic. Animal studies to determine the effects of the PHOTREXA/KXL corneal collagen cross-linking procedure on fertility were not conducted."

    "clinical_studies": [
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Three prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, sham-controlled trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of riboflavin ophthalmic solution/UVA irradiation for performing corneal collagen cross-linking. These trials were sham-controlled for the first 3 months and had a total duration of 12 months for safety and efficacy evaluations. Study 1 enrolled 58 patients with progressive keratoconus and 49 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Study 2 enrolled 147 patients with progressive keratoconus, and Study 3 enrolled 130 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. In each study, patients had one eye designated as the study eye and were randomized to receive one of two study treatments (CXL or sham) in their study eye at the baseline visit. The patients were evaluated at Day 1, Week 1, and Months 1, 3, 6, and 12. At Month 3 or later, patients had the option of receiving CXL treatment in both the sham study eyes and non-study eyes and were followed-up for 12 months from the time of receiving CXL treatment. Approximately 56% and 89% of the sham study eyes in patients with progressive keratoconus received CXL treatment by Month 3 and Month 6, respectively. The average age of keratoconus patients was 33 years. The average baseline K max value was 61 diopters. For corneal ectasia patients in Study 1 and Study 3, approximately 60% and 90% of the sham study eyes received CXL treatment by Month 3 and Month 6, respectively. The average age of corneal ectasia patients was 43 years and the average baseline K max was 55 diopters. A majority (93%) of the corneal ectasia patients had LASIK only, 5 (3%) patients had photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) only, and 8 (4%) patients had both LASIK and PRK. In each study, the maximum corneal curvature (K max ) was assessed at baseline, Months 1, 3, and 12. The CXL-treated eyes showed increasing improvement in K max from Month 3 through Month 12 ( Figure 1 ). Progressive keratoconus patients had an average K max reduction of 1.4 diopters in Study 1 and 1.7 diopters in Study 2 at Month 12 in the CXL-treated eyes while the sham eyes had an average increase of 0.5 diopter in Study 1 and 0.6 diopter in Study 2 at Month 12; the difference (95% CI) between the CXL and sham groups in the mean change from baseline K max were -1.9 (-3.4, -0.3) diopters in Study 1 and -2.3 (-3.5, -1.0) diopters in Study 2. For corneal ectasia patients, at Month 12, the CXL-treated eyes had an average K max reduction of 1.0 diopter in Study 1 and 0.5 diopter in Study 3 while the sham eyes had an average increase of 1.0 diopter in Study 1 and 0.5 diopter in Study 3; the treatment difference between the CXL and sham groups was: -2.0 (-3.0, -1.1) diopters in Study 1 and -1.1 (-1.9, -0.3) diopters in Study 3. Figure 1: Mean (SD) (Diopter) Baseline Kmax and Change from Baseline Kmax Post-baseline missing data were imputed using last available K max value. For the sham study eyes that received CXL treatment after baseline, the last K max measurement recorded prior to receiving CXL treatment was used in the analysis for later time points. In Study 3, four patients in the CXL group had missing baseline K max value and were excluded from the analysis. Figure 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite. The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva. eq"

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, C and D. Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg also provides fluoride for caries prophylaxis. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3-6 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.5 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a dose of 1 mL of Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg (See Dosage and Administration ). Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C and D to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride."

      "WARNINGS As in the case of all medications, keep out of reach of children."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. When prescribing vitamin fluoride products: Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other medications and swallowed toothpaste. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis. Multi-Vitamin Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.) Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule: If fluoride level is unknown, drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed. For testing of fluoride content, contact the local or state health department. All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history. Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex. Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing, unerupted teeth. Fluoride supplements require long-term compliance on a daily basis."
