    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection, USP. ( 5.2 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection, USP with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for Injection, USP, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for Injection, USP occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection, USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for Injection, USP. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for Injection, USP to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for Injection, USP is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for Injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for Injection, USP on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection, USP is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

Adult Patients During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for Injection, USP (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for Injection, USP. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for Injection, USP. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection, USP were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection, USP occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection, USP and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and (5.9) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for Injection, USP, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for Injection, USP was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection, USP and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem for Injection, USP was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection, USP and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for Injection, USP treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for Injection, USP was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for Injection, USP. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for Injection, USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection, USP with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection, USP and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for Injection, USP is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Meropenem for Injection, USP and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection, USP or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection, USP have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection, USP in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection, USP in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for Injection, USP in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ].

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection, USP is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for Injection, USP in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection, USP in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, USP, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection, USP in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem for Injection, USP is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, USP, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for Injection, USP in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection, USP in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, USP, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection, USP in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem for Injection, USP is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection, USP in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, USP, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem for Injection, USP COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection, USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection, USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection, USP. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection, USP is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection, USP on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection, USP is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 7. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) 8. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.). (5.2) 9. Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) 10. Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 11. Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) 12. In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) [ see AdverseReactions(6.2) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 )and Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection (I.V.), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 ) , Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) , Use in Specific Populations( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on a n outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) and ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection (I.V.) treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 3. Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended ( 7.1 ) 4. The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 2. Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage( 1.3 ) , Dosage and Administration( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies( 14.1 ) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion.Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below. Table 5: Meropenem Concentrations in Selected Tissues (Highest Concentrations Reported) Tissue Intravenous Dose (gram) Number of Samples Mean [mcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] at 1 hour unless otherwise noted Range [mcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] Endometrium 0.5 7 4.2 1.7 to 10.2 Myometrium 0.5 15 3.8 0.4 to 8.1 Ovary 0.5 8 2.8 0.8 to 4.8 Cervix 0.5 2 7 5.4 to 8.5 Fallopian tube 0.5 9 1.7 0.3 to 3.4 Skin 0.5 22 3.3 0.5 to 12.6 Interstitial fluid obtained from blister fluid 0.5 9 5.5 3.2 to 8.6 Skin 1 10 5.3 1.3 to 16.7 Interstitial fluid 1 5 26.3 20.9 to 37.4 Colon 1 2 2.6 2.5 to 2.7 Bile 1 7 14.6 (3 hours) 4 to 25.7 Gall bladder 1 1 - 3.9 Peritoneal fluid 1 9 30.2 7.4 to 54.6 Lung 1 2 4.8 (2 hours) 1.4 to 8.2 Bronchial mucosa 1 7 4.5 1.3 to 11.1 Muscle 1 2 6. 1 (2 hours) 5.3 to 6.9 Fascia 1 9 8.8 1.5 to 20 Heart valves 1 7 9.7 6.4 to 12.1 Myocardium 1 10 15.5 5.2 to 25.5 CSF (inflamed) 20 mg/kg in pediatric patients of age 5 months to 8 years 40 mg/kg in pediatric patients of age 1 month to 15 years 8 5 1.1 (2 hours) 3.3 (3 hours) 0.2 to 2.8 0.9 to 6.5 CSF (uninflamed) 1 4 0.2 (2 hours) 0.1 to 0.3 Elimination In subjects with normal renal function, the elimination half-life of meropenem is approximately 1 hour. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion.Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients at the post-treatment follow-up visit, with the percent cure in parentheses (Fully Evaluable analysis set).

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: 1 At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. 2 During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. 3 Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION (I.V.)

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 1. Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or other antibacterial drugs in the future. 2. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.5 ) ]. 3. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). If treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. 4. Patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of age and older only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of age and older only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , and Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

(2.3) Pediatric patients less than 3 months of age Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function (2.3) Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours - Intravenous infusion is to be given over 30 minutes. - There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. GA: gestational age and PNA: postnatal age 2.1 Adult Patients The recommended dose of meropenem for injection is 500 mg given every 8 hours for skin and skin structure infections and 1 gram given every 8 hours for intra-abdominal infections. When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P.aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing Table 1 below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 - age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 \u00d7 above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26-50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10-25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of meropenem for injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the Meropenem for Injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing Table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer meropenem for injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer meropenem for injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose.

For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see Table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and (2.6) ] . Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of meropenem for injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of meropenem for injection should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of meropenem for injection maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous meropenem for injection should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem for injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of meropenem for injection) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use In Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Savior Lifetec Corporation at 886-6-505-1200 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole : pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular : heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System : oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic : anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional : peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System : insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10) ] Respiratory : respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages : urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System : dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis. Hepatic Disorders: drug-induced liver injury."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Meropenem for injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free, synthetic, carbapenem antibacterial for intravenous administration. It is (4R,5S,6S)-3- [[(3S,5S)-5-(Dimethylcarbamoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxilic acid trihydrate. Its empirical formula is C 17 H 25 N 3 O 5 S\u22193H 2 O with a molecular weight of 437.52. Its structural formula is: Meropenem for injection is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder. The solution varies from colorless to yellow depending on the concentration. The pH of freshly constituted solutions is between 7.3 and 8.3. Meropenem is soluble in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution, sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in hydrated ethanol, and practically insoluble in acetone or ether. When re-constituted as instructed, each 1 gram meropenem for injection vial will deliver 1 gram of meropenem and 90.2 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (3.92 mEq). Each 500 mg meropenem for injection vial will deliver 500 mg meropenem and 45.1 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (1.96 mEq) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem readily penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-bindingprotein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

There was no evidence of mutagenic potential found in any of these tests. Impairment of Fertility: In fertility studies, intravenous meropenem was administered to male rats beginning 11 weeks before mating and throughout mating and to female rats from 2 weeks before mating through Gestation Day 7 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparison, approximately 3.2 times to the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7 .

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61-68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10 ). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following Table 11 shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 11: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population Treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20-40 decibels 20% 24% Greater than 40-60 decibels 8% 7% Greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] ."

Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Discard unused portion. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) ]. Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of Meropenem maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous Meropenem should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of Meropenem) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) ( 5.2 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection (I.V.), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.9 ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection (I.V.) treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ].

Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below. Table 5: Meropenem Concentrations in Selected Tissues (Highest Concentrations Reported) 1 at 1 hour unless otherwise noted 2 obtained from blister fluid 3 in pediatric patients of age 5 months to 8 years 4 in pediatric patients of age 1 month to 15 years Tissue Intravenous Dose (gram) Number of Samples Mean [\u03bcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] 1 Range [\u03bcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] Endometrium 0.5 7 4.2 1.7 to 10.2 Myometrium 0.5 15 3.8 0.4 to 8.1 Ovary 0.5 8 2.8 0.8 to 4.8 Cervix 0.5 2 7 5.4 to 8.5 Fallopian tube 0.5 9 1.7 0.3 to 3.4 Skin 0.5 22 3.3 0.5 to 12.6 Interstitial fluid 2 0.5 9 5.5 3.2 to 8.6 Skin 1 10 5.3 1.3 to 16.7 Interstitial fluid 2 1 5 26.3 20.9 to 37.4 Colon 1 2 2.6 2.5 to 2.7 Bile 1 7 14.6 (3 hours) 4 to 25.7 Gall bladder 1 1 - 3.9 Peritoneal fluid 1 9 30.2 7.4 to 54.6 Lung 1 2 4.8 (2 hours) 1.4 to 8.2 Bronchial mucosa 1 7 4.5 1.3 to 11.1 Muscle 1 2 6.1 (2 hours) 5.3 to 6.9 Fascia 1 9 8.8 1.5 to 20 Heart valves 1 7 9.7 6.4 to 12.1 Myocardium 1 10 15.5 5.2 to 25.5 CSF (inflamed) 20 mg/kg 3 40 mg/kg 4 8 5 1.1 (2 hours) 3.3 (3 hours) 0.2 to 2.8 0.9 to 6.5 CSF (uninflamed) 1 4 0.2 (2 hours) 0.1 to 0.3 Elimination In subjects with normal renal function, the elimination half-life of meropenem is approximately 1 hour. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group.

Mutagenesis: Genetic toxicity studies were performed with meropenem using the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Chinese hamster ovary HGPRT assay, cultured human lymphocytes cytogenic assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential found in any of these tests. Impairment of Fertility: In fertility studies, intravenous meropenem was administered to male rats beginning 11 weeks before mating and throughout mating and to female rats from 2 weeks before mating through Gestation Day 7 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparison, approximately 3.2 times to the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7 .

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9 : Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of- Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10 ). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses.

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). If treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ].

Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Discard unused portion. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) ]. Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of Meropenem maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous Meropenem should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of Meropenem) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) ( 5.2 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection (I.V.), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.9 ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection (I.V.) treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ].

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7 .

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/ metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9 : Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10 ). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis 1 (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 2 (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION (I.V.)

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). If treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenen for injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: \u2022Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) \u2022Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) \u2022Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenen for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenen for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenen for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenen for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenen for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenen for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenen for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenen for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) \u2022Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenen. ( 5.2 ) \u2022Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) \u2022Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022Co-administration of meropenen with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) \u2022In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenen, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenen occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenen [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenen and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenen. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenen to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenen is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenen, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenen in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenen on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenen is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders : angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders : Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders : rhabdomyolysis. Hepatic Disorders: drug-induced liver injury."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022Co-administration of meropenen with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) \u2022The concomitant use of meropenen and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of meropenem in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] .

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14\u201326) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39\u201358) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18\u201365) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83\u2013140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% \u2013 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1\u20132 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14\u201326) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39\u201358) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18\u201365) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83\u2013140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% \u2013 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1\u20132 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."

Mutagenesis: Genetic toxicity studies were performed with meropenem using the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Chinese hamster ovary HGPRT assay, cultured human lymphocytes cytogenic assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential found in any of these tests. Impairment of Fertility: In fertility studies, intravenous meropenem was administered to male rats beginning 11 weeks before mating and throughout mating and to female rats from 2 weeks before mating through Gestation Day 7 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparison, approximately 3.2 times to the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61\u201368%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: 1.At the 5\u20137 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness.2.During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs.3.Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION \u2022Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\u2022Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.6)].\u2022Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5)].\u2022Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Co-administration of meropenem for injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem for injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem for injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these included a prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem for injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] ."

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with bacterial meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The most common adverse reactions and their rates of occurrence were as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In these studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem for injection and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem for injection-treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (seizures that occurred on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 patients in the comparator arm. The meropenem for injection group had a statistically higher number of patients than the comparator with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Adverse Reactions from Studies of Meropenem for Injectionin Other Serious Bacterial Infections (not bacterial meningitis) The following adverse reactions occurred in studies of 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients who received meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours) for the treatment of other serious bacterial infections (not bacterial meningitis). This meropenem for injection product is indicated only for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by certain organisms in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 )]. Many patients in these studies were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem for injection. Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem for injection; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem for injection discontinued because of adverse events. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions that were reported with meropenem for injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site (2.4%), injection site reaction (0.9%), phlebitis/thrombophlebitis (0.8%), pain at the injection site (0.4%), and edema at the injection site (0.2%) Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 1% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding Events: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed under the Clinical Trials Experience subsection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration of meropenem for injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and therefore Meropenem for Injection is not recommended ( 7.1 ) \u2022 The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 1 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem for injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae , and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem for injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Meropenem for Injection contains meropenem a synthetic carbapenem antibacterial. Meropenem is (4R,5S,6S)-3-[[(3S,5S)-5-(Dimethylcarbamoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid trihydrate. Its empirical formula is C 17 H 25 N 3 O 5 S\u20223H 2 O with a molecular weight of 437.52. Its structural formula is: Meropenem is soluble in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution, sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in hydrated ethanol, and practically insoluble in acetone or ether. Meropenem for Injection is a white to pale yellow sterile powder for intravenous administration. Each vial contains meropenem equivalent to 2 grams and 416 mg of sodium bicarbonate, anhydrous. When re-constituted as instructed Meropenem for Injection will deliver 2 grams of meropenem (on anhydrous basis) and approximately 180 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (7.8 mEq) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. The solution varies from colorless to yellow depending on the concentration. The pH of freshly constituted solutions is between 7.3 and 8.3. structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 2 below.

The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients 3 months to 2 years of age. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with meopenem for injection in adult patients with renal impairment have shown that the reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. The effect of renal impairment on the PK of meropenem has not been studied in the pediatric patients. Therefore, there is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 2 below. Table 1: Meropenem Concentrations in Selected Tissues (Highest Concentrations Reported) Tissue Intravenous Dose (gram) Number of Samples Mean [mcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] at 1 hour unless otherwise noted Range [mcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] Endometrium 0.5 7 4.2 1.7 to 10.2 Myometrium 0.5 15 3.8 0.4 to 8.1 Ovary 0.5 8 2.8 0.8 to 4.8 Cervix 0.5 2 7 5.4 to 8.5 Fallopian tube 0.5 9 1.7 0.3 to 3.4 Skin 0.5 22 3.3 0.5 to 12.6 Interstitial fluid obtained from blister fluid 0.5 9 5.5 3.2 to 8.6 Skin 1 10 5.3 1.3 to 16.7 Interstitial fluid 1 5 26.3 20.9 to 37.4 Colon 1 2 2.6 2.5 to 2.7 Bile 1 7 14.6 (3 hours) 4 to 25.7 Gall bladder 1 1 - 3.9 Peritoneal fluid 1 9 30.2 7.4 to 54.6 Lung 1 2 4.8 (2 hours) 1.4 to 8.2 Bronchial mucosa 1 7 4.5 1.3 to 11.1 Muscle 1 2 6. 1 (2 hours) 5.3 to 6.9 Fascia 1 9 8.8 1.5 to 20 Heart valves 1 7 9.7 6.4 to 12.1 Myocardium 1 10 15.5 5.2 to 25.5 CSF (inflamed) 20 mg/kg in pediatric patients of age 5 months to 8 years 40 mg/kg in pediatric patients of age 1 month to 15 years (Meropenem for Injection is not approved for use in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age) 8 5 1.1 (2 hours) 3.3 (3 hours) 0.2 to 2.8 0.9 to 6.5 CSF (uninflamed) 1 4 0.2 (2 hours) 0.1 to 0.3 Elimination In subjects with normal renal function, the elimination half-life of meropenem is approximately 1 hour. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients 3 months to 2 years of age. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with meopenem for injection in adult patients with renal impairment have shown that the reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. The effect of renal impairment on the PK of meropenem has not been studied in the pediatric patients. Therefore, there is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem for injection (n = 225) at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. A patient was defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: 1 At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. 2 During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. 3 Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using these criteria, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 3). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Table 3: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis Microorganisms Meropenem for Injection Comparator S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem for injection group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. Table 4 shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem for injection-treated patients and comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Antibacterial Resistance Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Diarrhea Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Potential of Neuromotor Impairment Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of age and older only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of age and older only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , and Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use In Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Savior Lifetec Corporation at 886-6-505-1200 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole : pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular : heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System : oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic : anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional : peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System : insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10) ] Respiratory : respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages : urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System : dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis. Hepatic Disorders: drug-induced liver injury."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Meropenem for injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free, synthetic, carbapenem antibacterial for intravenous administration. It is (4R,5S,6S)-3- [[(3S,5S)-5-(Dimethylcarbamoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxilic acid trihydrate. Its empirical formula is C 17 H 25 N 3 O 5 S\u22193H 2 O with a molecular weight of 437.52. Its structural formula is: Meropenem for injection is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder. The solution varies from colorless to yellow depending on the concentration. The pH of freshly constituted solutions is between 7.3 and 8.3. Meropenem is soluble in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution, sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in hydrated ethanol, and practically insoluble in acetone or ether. When re-constituted as instructed, each 1 gram meropenem for injection vial will deliver 1 gram of meropenem and 90.2 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (3.92 mEq). Each 500 mg meropenem for injection vial will deliver 500 mg meropenem and 45.1 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (1.96 mEq) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem readily penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-bindingprotein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

There was no evidence of mutagenic potential found in any of these tests. Impairment of Fertility: In fertility studies, intravenous meropenem was administered to male rats beginning 11 weeks before mating and throughout mating and to female rats from 2 weeks before mating through Gestation Day 7 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparison, approximately 3.2 times to the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7 .

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61-68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10 ). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following Table 11 shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 11: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population Treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20-40 decibels 20% 24% Greater than 40-60 decibels 8% 7% Greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for Injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: \u2022 Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.1) \u2022 Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). (1.2) \u2022 Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.3) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for Injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

GA: gestational age and PNA: postnatal age 2.1 Adult Patients The recommended dose of Meropenem for Injection is 500 mg given every 8 hours for skin and skin structure infections and 1 gram given every 8 hours for intra-abdominal infections. When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 x above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of Meropenem for Injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the Meropenem for Injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer Meropenem for Injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer Meropenem for Injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection. (5.2) Rhabdomyolysis: If sign or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy.(5.3) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.4) Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.5, 7.2) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.6) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. (5.9) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for Injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for Injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for Injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

Adult Patients During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for Injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for Injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for Injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). \u00ad Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10)] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for Injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis) Meropenem for Injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis Meropenem for Injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for Injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age) Meropenem for Injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for Injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia(Conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1) \u2022 The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.5, 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. (2.2, 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for Injection, approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14-26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18-65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83-140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14-26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18-65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83-140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

N=number of patients in the clinically evaluable population or subgroup within treatment groups. %= Percent of satisfactory clinical response at follow-up evaluation. The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event was similar for both treatment groups (meropenem, 2.5% and imipenem-cilastatin, 2.7%). 14.2 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections One controlled clinical study of complicated intra-abdominal infection was performed in the United States where meropenem was compared with clindamycin/tobramycin. Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem for Injection COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) 1 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) 2 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 11: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population Treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20 to 40 decibels 20% 24% Greater than 40 to 60 decibels 8% 7% Greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Such use would result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. Do not introduce additives into the DUPLEX\u00ae Container. Administer Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection intravenously over approximately 15 to 30 minutes. This reconstituted solution is for intravenous use only. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact. DUPLEX \u00ae Container Storage To avoid inadvertent activation, the DUPLEX \u00ae Container should remain in the folded position until activation is intended. Patient Labeling and Drug Powder/Diluent Inspection Apply patient-specific label on foil side of container. Use care to avoid activation. Do not cover any portion of foil strip with patient label. Unlatch side tab and unfold DUPLEX \u00ae Container (see Diagram 1 ). Visually inspect diluent chamber for particulate matter. Use only if container and seals are intact. To inspect the drug powder for foreign matter or discoloration, peel foil strip from drug chamber (see Diagram 2 ). Protect from light after removal of foil strip. Note: If foil strip is removed, the container should be re-folded and the side tab latched until ready to activate. The product must then be used within 7 days at room temperature, but not beyond the labeled expiration date. Reconstitution (Activation) Do not use directly after storage by refrigeration, allow the product to equilibrate to room temperature before patient use. Unfold the DUPLEX \u00ae Container and point the set port in a downward direction. Starting at the hanger tab end, fold the DUPLEX \u00ae Container just below the diluent meniscus trapping all air above the fold. To activate, squeeze the folded diluent chamber until the seal between the diluent and powder opens, releasing diluent into the drug powder chamber (see Diagram 3 ). Agitate the liquid-powder mixture until the drug powder is completely dissolved. Note: Following reconstitution (activation), product must be used within 1 hour if stored at room temperature or within 15 hours if stored under refrigeration. Administration Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter. Point the set port in a downwards direction. Starting at the hanger tab end, fold the DUPLEX \u00ae Container just below the solution meniscus trapping all air above the fold. Squeeze the folded DUPLEX \u00ae Container until the seal between reconstituted drug solution and set port opens, releasing liquid to set port (see Diagram 4 ). Prior to attaching the IV set, check for minute leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are found, discard container and solution as sterility may be compromised. Using aseptic technique, peel foil cover from the set port and attach sterile administration set (see Diagram 5 ). Refer to directions for use accompanying the administration set. Discard unused portion. Diagram 1 Diagram 2 Diagram 3 Diagram 4 Diagram 5 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should be used.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem intravenous. Discontinue meropenem immediately if patients experience these signs and symptoms and consider alternative treatment. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients where the administration of sodium could be detrimental. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another beta-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Anti-convulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, place on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile \u2013Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use In Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.11 High Sodium Load Each 500 mg of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection delivers 245.1 mg (10.7 mEq) of sodium and each 1 gram of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection delivers 290.2 mg (12.6 mEq) of sodium. Avoid use of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with congestive heart failure, elderly patients and patients requiring restricted sodium intake."

Braun Medical Inc. at 1-800-854-6851 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1000 mg every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem for injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem for injection.

The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported irrespective of relationship to meropenem for injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months of age and older to below 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months of age and older to below 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem for injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of Meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Coadministration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric use: Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should not be used in pediatric patients who require less than the full adult dose of meropenem. ( 8.4 ) Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and cynomolgus macaques administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 3.2 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison [see Data] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproductive studies have been performed with meropenem in rats at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day and in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 360 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparisons, approximately 3.2 times and 2.3 times higher, respectively, than the maximum recommended human dose of 1 gram every 8 hours). These studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to meropenem, although there were slight changes in fetal body weight at doses of 250 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 0.8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison) and above in rats. In a published study 2 , meropenem administered to pregnant rats from Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17, was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the highest recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 1 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Postpartum Day 21. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the highest recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breastfed \u2013child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in the DUPLEX\u00ae Container and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed-child from Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in the DUPLEX\u00ae Container or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in the DUPLEX\u00ae Container is designed to deliver a 500 mg or 1 gram dose of meropenem. To prevent unintentional overdose, this product should not be used in pediatric patients who require less than the full adult dose of meropenem. Meropenem is not to be used in pediatric patients aged less than three months. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Use of meropenem for injection in pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population. Use of meropenem for injection in pediatric patients with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies with adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of meropenem for injection in pediatric patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study with adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage (1) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of meropenem for injection, approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Each 500 mg of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection delivers 245.1 mg (10.7 mEq) of sodium and each 1 gram of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection delivers 290.2 mg (12.6 mEq) of sodium. At the usual recommended doses of 500 mg or 1000 mg every 8 hours, patients would receive between 735 mg/day and 870 mg/day (32 mEq and 38 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure [see C ontraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200-4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited post-marketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Symptomatic treatments should be considered. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14-26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18-65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83-140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in table 3 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50 \u2013 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38%. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to reach penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem has significant stability to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Meropenem does not have in-vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases). Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials I n vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridioides difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Test Methods For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria, and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: http://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14-26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18-65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83-140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in table 3 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50 \u2013 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 5.

The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients at the post-treatment follow-up visit, with the percent cure in parentheses (Fully Evaluable analysis set).

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 7. Table 7: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable population with Complicated intra-abdominal infections Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) Meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) Meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) Meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months of age and older to below 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61-68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 8). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 8: Efficacy Rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) beta-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-beta-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 9: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20-40 decibels 20% 24% greater than 40-60 decibels 8% 7% greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Meropenem for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection contains a high sodium load. Instruct patients to inform or report symptoms of difficulty breathing, swelling, or increased weight [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for Injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: \u2022 Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) \u2022 Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) \u2022 Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for Injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

GA: gestational age and PNA: postnatal age 2.1 Adult Patients The recommended dose of Meropenem for Injection is 500 mg given every 8 hours for skin and skin structure infections and 1 gram given every 8 hours for intra-abdominal infections. When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 x above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of Meropenem for Injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the Meropenem for Injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer Meropenem for Injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer Meropenem for Injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the Meropenem for Injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing table 3 below. Meropenem for Injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.

For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with Sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 )]. Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem for Injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for Injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem for Injection should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of Meropenem for Injection maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous Meropenem for Injection should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem for Injection vials re-constituted with Sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of Meropenem for Injection) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem for Injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem for Injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue Meropenem for Injection and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for Injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue Meropenem for Injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for Injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for Injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for Injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for Injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for Injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). \u00ad Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and ( 5.10 )] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for Injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for Injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem for Injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for Injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for Injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for Injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including Meropenem for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis. Hepatic Disorders: drug-induced liver injury."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for Injection, approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem for Injection is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem for Injection is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

The clinical efficacy rates by pathogen are provided in Table 8. The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients at the post-treatment follow-up visit, with the percent cure in parentheses (Fully Evaluable analysis set).

The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event was similar for both treatment groups (meropenem, 2.5% and imipenem-cilastatin, 2.7%). 14.2 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections One controlled clinical study of complicated intra-abdominal infection was performed in the United States where meropenem was compared with clindamycin/tobramycin. Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem for Injection COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) 1 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) 2 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) 1 (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 2 (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for Injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: \u2022 Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.1) \u2022 Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). (1.2) \u2022 Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.3) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for Injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

Administer Meropenem for Injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the Meropenem for Injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing table 3 below. Meropenem for Injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Table 3: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. 2.4 Preparation and Administration of Meropenem for Injection Important Administration Instructions Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with Sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and (2.6)]. Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem for Injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for Injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem for Injection should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of Meropenem for Injection maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous Meropenem for Injection should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem for Injection vials re-constituted with Sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of Meropenem for Injection) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem for Injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem for Injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection. (5.2) Rhabdomyolysis: If sign or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy.(5.3) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.4) Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.5, 7.2) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.6) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. (5.9) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for Injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for Injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for Injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Steriscience at 1-888-278-1784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for Injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for Injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for Injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). \u00ad Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10)] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for Injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis) Meropenem for Injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash \ufffd 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis Meropenem for Injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for Injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age) Meropenem for Injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for Injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia(Conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1) \u2022 The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.5, 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. (2.2, 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for Injection, approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14-26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18-65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83-140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14-26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39-58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18-65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83-140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm.

Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem for Injection COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) 1 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) 2 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 11: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population Treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20 to 40 decibels 20% 24% Greater than 40 to 60 decibels 8% 7% Greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection on a n outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.9 ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration of Meropenem for injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended ( 7.1 ) \u2022 The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem for injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for injection in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ].

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38%. [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38%. [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] ."

Impairment of Fertility: In fertility studies, intravenous meropenem was administered to male rats beginning 11 weeks before mating and throughout mating and to female rats from 2 weeks before mating through Gestation Day 7 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparison, approximately 3.2 times to the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: 1 At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. 2 During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. 3 Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. \u2022 Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. \u2022 Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection. If treatment with Meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. \u2022 Patients receiving Meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ].

Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.2 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Meropenem for Injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection. (5.2) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.3) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.4) Co-administration of meropenem for injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.5, 7.2) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.6) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed (5.9) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem for injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem for injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)] . During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these included a prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and reexamine the dosage of meropenem for injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile - associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures,delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] ."

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with bacterial meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The most common adverse reactions and their rates of occurrence were as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In these studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem for injection and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem for injection-treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (seizures that occurred on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 patients in the comparator arm. The meropenem for injection group had a statistically higher number of patients than the comparator with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Adverse Reactions from Studies of Meropenem for Injection in Other Serious Bacterial Infections (not bacterial meningitis) The following adverse reactions occurred in studies of 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients who received meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours) for the treatment of other serious bacterial infections (not bacterial meningitis). This meropenem for injection product is indicated only for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by certain organisms in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older [see Indications and Usage (1.1)] . Many patients in these studies were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem for injection. Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem for injection; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem for injection discontinued because of adverse events. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions that were reported with meropenem for injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site (2.4%), injection site reaction (0.9%), phlebitis/thrombophlebitis (0.8%), pain at the injection site (0.4%), and edema at the injection site (0.2%). Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 1% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding Event s : gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure,dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia,hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities that occurred in greater than 0.2% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem for injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and therefore Meropenem for Injection is not recommended. (7.1) The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium (5.4, 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature1, intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenemrelated effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem for injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae , and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem for injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 2 below.

The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients 3 months to 2 years of age. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with meropenem for injection in adult patients with renal impairment have shown that the reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. The effect of renal impairment on the PK of meropenem has not been studied in the pediatric patients. Therefore, there is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Drug Interaction Studies Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem for injection (n = 225) at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. A patient was defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 57-week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits; hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears; or blindness. During therapy the patients clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using these criteria, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 3). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured.

With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. Table 4 shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem for injection-treated patients and comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Antibacterial Resistance Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Diarrhea Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Potential of Neuromotor Impairment Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] .

Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - age) __ 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 x above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of Meropenem for injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older \u2022For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the Meropenem for injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. \u2022For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer Meropenem for injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. \u2022Administer Meropenem for injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. \u2022There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the Meropenem for injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing table 3 below. Meropenem for injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Table 3: RecommendedMeropenem for injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment 2.4 Preparation and Administration of Meropenem for injection Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Discard unused portion. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion \u2022Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. \u2022Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) ]. \u2022Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of Meropenem maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous Meropenem should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of Meropenem) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 1. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) 2. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection. ( 5.2 ) 3. Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. () 4. Co-administration of Meropenem for injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 5. Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) 6. In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 )and Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 ) , Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) , Use in Specific Populations( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection on a n outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions( ) and ( ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions (), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 1. Co-administration of Meropenem for injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended ( 7.1 ) 2. The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 2. Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem for injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage( 1.3 ) , Dosage and Administration( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies( 14.1 ) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients.

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 ) , Warnings and Precautions( ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38%. [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: 1 At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. 2 During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. 3 Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 1. Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. 2. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.5 ) ]. 3. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection. If treatment with Meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. 4. Patients receiving Meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ].

Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Discard unused portion. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) ]. Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of Meropenem should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of Meropenem maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous Meropenem should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of Meropenem) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (Meropenem concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) ( 5.2 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection (I.V.), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.9 ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection (I.V.) treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well- controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]."

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7 .

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9 : Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10 ). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses.

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). If treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.1) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). (1.2) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.3) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection (I.V.) and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Meropenem for injection (I.V.) has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection (I.V.) and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and (2.6) ] . Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of meropenem for injection (I.V.) with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of meropenem for injection (I.V.) should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of meropenem for injection (I.V.) maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.3) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.4) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.5 , 7.2) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.6) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. (5.9) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2,904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%) and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 ) ] . Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.5 , 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 ) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. (2.2 , 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1 ) ] .

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 ) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2,200 mg/kg to 4,000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited post-marketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem IV is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Test ing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem IV is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

N=number of patients in the clinically evaluable population or respective subgroup within treatment groups. The clinical efficacy rates by pathogen are provided in Table 8. The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients at the post-treatment follow-up visit, with the percent cure in parentheses (Fully Evaluable analysis set).

Patients may have more than one pretreatment pathogen. 2. n=number of patients with satisfactory response. 3. N=number of patients in the clinically evaluable population or subgroup within treatment groups. 4. %= Percent of satisfactory clinical response at follow-up evaluation. The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event was similar for both treatment groups (meropenem, 2.5% and imipenem-cilastatin, 2.7%). 14.2 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections One controlled clinical study of complicated intra-abdominal infection was performed in the United States where meropenem was compared with clindamycin/tobramycin. Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) Meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) Meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) Meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61% to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) 1 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) 2 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) 1. (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 2. (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 11: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population Treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20 to 40 decibels 20% 24% Greater than 40 to 60 decibels 8% 7% Greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

    "information_for_patients": [
      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem. If treatment with meropenem is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

(2.3) Pediatric patients less than 3 months of age Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function (2.3) Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours - Intravenous infusion is to be given over 30 minutes. - There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. GA: gestational age and PNA: postnatal age 2.1 Adult Patients The recommended dose of meropenem for injection is 500 mg given every 8 hours for skin and skin structure infections and 1 gram given every 8 hours for intra-abdominal infections. When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing Table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 - age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 \u00d7 above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26-50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10-25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of meropenem for injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the meropenem for injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing Table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer meropenem for injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer meropenem for injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the meropenem for injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing Table 3 below. Meropenem for injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.

For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see Table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , (2.6) ] . Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of meropenem for injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of meropenem for injection should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of meropenem for injection maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous meropenem for injection should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem for injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of meropenem for injection) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. ( 5.2 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.5 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Savior Lifetec Corporation at 886-6-505-1200 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole : pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular : heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System : oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic : anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional : peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System : insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , (5.9) ] Respiratory : respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages : urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System : dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Intra-abdominal Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of meropenem in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Bacterial Meningitis Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of meropenem, approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Meropenem for injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free, synthetic, carbapenem antibacterial for intravenous administration. It is (4R,5S,6S)-3- [[(3S,5S)-5-(Dimethylcarbamoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxilic acid trihydrate. Its empirical formula is C 17 H 25 N 3 O 5 S\u22193H 2 O with a molecular weight of 437.52. Its structural formula is: Meropenem for injection is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder. The solution varies from colorless to yellow depending on the concentration. The pH of freshly constituted solutions is between 7.3 and 8.3. Meropenem is soluble in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution, sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in hydrated ethanol, and practically insoluble in acetone or ether. When re-constituted as instructed, each 1 gram meropenem for injection vial will deliver 1 gram of meropenem and 90.2 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (3.92 mEq). Each 500 mg meropenem for injection vial will deliver 500 mg meropenem and 45.1 mg of sodium as sodium carbonate (1.96 mEq) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: http://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)."

    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% - 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: http://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61-68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS Meropenem COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following Table 11 shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. Table 11: Hearing Loss at Post-Therapy in the Evaluable Population Treated with Meropenem Degree of Hearing Loss (in one or both ears) Meropenem n = 128 Comparator n = 135 No loss 61% 56% 20-40 decibels 20% 24% Greater than 40-60 decibels 8% 7% Greater than 60 decibels 9% 10%"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] ."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for Injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.1 ) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species . 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron , and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for Injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Meropenem for Injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 500 mg every 8 hours by intravenous infusion over 15 to 30 minutes for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) for adult patients. When treating infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. (2.1) 1 gram every 8 hours by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes for intra-abdominal infections for adult patients. (2.1) 1 gram every 8 hours by intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over 3 minutes to 5 minutes for adult patients. (2.1) Dosage should be reduced in adult patients with renal impairment. (2.2) Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours Pediatric patients 3 months of age and older Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function (2.3) Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure* 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Intra-abdominal 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 gram Every 8 hours - Intravenous infusion is to be given over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. - Intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) is to be given over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. - There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. * 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended when treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa . (2.3) Pediatric patients less than 3 months of age Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function (2.3) Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours - Intravenous infusion is to be given over 30 minutes. - There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. GA: gestational age and PNA: postnatal age 2.1 Adult Patients The recommended dose of Meropenem for Injection is 500 mg given every 8 hours for skin and skin structure infections and 1 gram given every 8 hours for intra-abdominal infections. When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 x above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of Meropenem for Injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the Meropenem for Injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer Meropenem for Injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer Meropenem for Injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the Meropenem for Injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing table 3 below. Meropenem for Injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Table 3: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. 2.4 Preparation and Administration of Meropenem for Injection Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) a nd (2.6) ] . Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of Meropenem for Injection with other drugs has not been established.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue Meropenem for Injection and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for Injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue Meropenem for Injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for Injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for Injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Clostridioides d ifficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for Injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for Injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2,904 patients treated with Meropenem for Injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for Injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for Injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for Injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for Injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for Injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for Injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for Injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for Injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem, including Meropenem for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders : angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders : Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis. Hepatic Disorders : drug-induced liver injury."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of Meropenem for Injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of Meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for Injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1,000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for Injection in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] .

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2,200 mg/kg to 4,000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem for Injection is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection (I.V.), in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes \u00ad Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for Injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for Injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for Injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Meropenem for Injection is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for Injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection (I.V.), in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses.

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ].

(1.3) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection (I.V.) and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Meropenem for injection (I.V.) has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection (I.V.) and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection(I.V.) should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

GA: gestational age and PNA: postnatal age 2.1 Adult Patients The recommended dose of meropenem for injection (I.V.) is 500 mg given every 8 hours for skin and skin structure infections and 1 gram given every 8 hours for intra-abdominal infections. When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 x above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the meropenem for injection (I.V.) dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. (5.2) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.3) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.4 , 7.2) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.5) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. (5.8) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2,904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%) and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and (5.9) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis: Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.4, 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. (2.2 , 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of meropenem in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ].

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2,200 mg/kg to 4,000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited post-marketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem IV is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem IV is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm.

The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event was similar for both treatment groups (meropenem, 2.5% and imipenem-cilastatin, 2.7%). 14.2 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections One controlled clinical study of complicated intra-abdominal infection was performed in the United States where meropenem was compared with clindamycin/tobramycin. Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) Meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) Meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) Meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61% to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) 1 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) 2 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) 1.

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem. If treatment with meropenem is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anticonvulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

When treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours is recommended. Meropenem for injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 - age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 \u00d7 above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26\u201350 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10\u201325 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of meropenem for injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the meropenem for injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer meropenem for injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer meropenem for injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy.( 5.3 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Seizure Potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Clostridioides difficile \u2013 associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Potential for Neuromotor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.10) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders : angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders : Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of meropenem in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] .

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14\u201326) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39\u201358) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18\u201365) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83\u2013140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% \u2013 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1\u20132 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14\u201326) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39\u201358) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18\u201365) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83\u2013140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% \u2013 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1\u20132 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61\u201368%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5\u20137 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses.

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ).

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection, is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: \u2022 Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.1) \u2022 Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). (1.2) \u2022 Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). (1.3) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

Doses of 1 gram may also be administered as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. 2.2 Use in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage should be reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less. (See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 x above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of meropenem for injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the meropenem for injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer meropenem for injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer meropenem for injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the meropenem for injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing table 3 below. meropenem for injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Table 3: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. 2.4 Preparation and Administration of Meropenem for Injection Important Administration Instructions Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with Sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and (2.6)]. Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of meropenem for injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of meropenem for injection should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of meropenem for injection maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous meropenem for injection should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem for injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg/mL of meropenem for injection) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or for 13 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) or 15 hours at up to 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) \u2022 Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection. (5.2) \u2022 Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.3) \u2022 Co-administration of meropenem for injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.4, 7.2) \u2022 Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.5) \u2022 In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. (5.8) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem for injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem for injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem for injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

Adult Patients During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem for injection. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with meropenem for injection. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem for injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem for injection occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem for injection and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). \u00ad Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and (5.9)] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem for injection, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis) Meropenem for injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem for injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age) Meropenem for injection was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem for injection. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia(Conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration of meropenem for injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1) \u2022 The concomitant use of meropenem for injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.4, 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

(2.2, 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature2, intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem for injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem for injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem for injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of meropenem for injection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients.

Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Intentional overdosing of meropenem for injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem for injection in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

The proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event was similar for both treatment groups (meropenem, 2.5% and imipenem-cilastatin, 2.7%). 14.2 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections One controlled clinical study of complicated intra-abdominal infection was performed in the United States where meropenem was compared with clindamycin/tobramycin. Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION COMPARATOR S. pneumoniae 17/24 (71) 19/30 (63) H. influenzae (+) 1 8/10 (80) 6/6 (100) H. influenzae (-/NT) 2 44/59 (75) 44/60 (73) N. meningitidis 30/35 (86) 35/39 (90) Total (including others) 102/131 (78) 108/140 (77) (+) \u03b2-lactamase-producing (-/NT) non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing or not tested Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured. Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meropenem for injection has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of meropenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, meropenem for injection should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

(See dosing table below.) When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft and Gault equation) 1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. Males: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: 0.85 \u00d7 above value Table 1: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Dose (dependent on type of infection) Dosing Interval Greater than 50 Recommended dose (500 mg cSSSI and 1 gram Intra-abdominal) Every 8 hours 26 to 50 Recommended dose Every 12 hours 10 to 25 One-half recommended dose Every 12 hours Less than 10 One-half recommended dose Every 24 hours There is inadequate information regarding the use of meropenem for injection in patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Use in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older For pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, the meropenem for injection dose is 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum dose is 2 grams every 8 hours), depending on the type of infection (cSSSI, cIAI, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis). See dosing table 2 below. For pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg administer meropenem for injection at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for cSSSI, 1 gram every 8 hours for cIAI and 2 grams every 8 hours for meningitis. Administer meropenem for injection as an intravenous infusion over approximately 15 minutes to 30 minutes or as an intravenous bolus injection (5 mL to 20 mL) over approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes. There is limited safety data available to support the administration of a 40 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 2 grams) bolus dose. Table 2: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older with Normal Renal Function Type of Infection Dose (mg/kg) Up to a Maximum Dose Dosing Interval Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 500 mg Every 8 hours Complicated intra-abdominal infections 20 1 gram Every 8 hours Meningitis 40 2 grams Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. When treating cSSSI caused by P. aeruginosa , a dose of 20 mg/kg (or 1 gram for pediatric patients weighing over 50 kg) every 8 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age For pediatric patients (with normal renal function) less than 3 months of age, with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the meropenem for injection dose is based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). See dosing table 3 below. Meropenem for injection should be given as intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Table 3: Recommended Meropenem for Injection Dosage Schedule for Pediatric Patients Less than 3 Months of Age with Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Normal Renal Function Age Group Dose (mg/kg) Dose Interval Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 12 hours Infants less than 32 weeks GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA less than 2 weeks 20 Every 8 hours Infants 32 weeks and older GA and PNA 2 weeks and older 30 Every 8 hours There is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment. 2.4 Preparation and Administration of Meropenem for Injection Important Administration Instructions: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intravenous Bolus Administration Re-constitute injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) with sterile Water for Injection (see table 4 below). Shake to dissolve and let stand until clear. Table 4: Volume of Sterile Water for Injection for Reconstitution of Injection Vials Vial Size Amount of Diluent Added (mL) Approximate Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Average Concentration (mg/mL) 500 mg 10 10 50 1 gram 20 20 50 For Infusion Injection vials (500 mg and 1 gram) may be directly re-constituted with a compatible infusion fluid. Alternatively, an injection vial may be re-constituted, then the resulting solution added to an intravenous container and further diluted with an appropriate infusion fluid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 )] . Do not use flexible container in series connections. 2.5 Compatibility Compatibility of meropenem for injection with other drugs has not been established. Meropenem for injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.6 Stability and Storage Freshly prepared solutions of meropenem for injection should be used. However, re-constituted solutions of meropenem for injection maintain satisfactory potency under the conditions described below. Solutions of intravenous meropenem for injection should not be frozen. Intravenous Bolus Administration Meropenem for injection vials re-constituted with sterile Water for Injection for bolus administration (up to 50 mg per mL of meropenem for injection) may be stored for up to 3 hours at up to 25 o C (77 o F) or for 13 hours at up to 5 o C (41 o F). Intravenous Infusion Administration Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg per mL to 20 mg per mL) re-constituted with Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% may be stored for 1 hour at up to 25 o C (77 o F) or 15 hours at up to 5 o C (41 o F). Solutions prepared for infusion (meropenem for injection concentrations ranging from 1 mg per mL to 20 mg per mL) re-constituted with Dextrose Injection 5% should be used immediately."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] ."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with meropenem (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem. The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2,904 patients treated with meropenem. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with meropenem were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem occurring in greater than 1.0% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with meropenem and occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and ( 5.10 )] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7.0%), diarrhea (7.0%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with meropenem, increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1.0% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to meropenem. The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5.0% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meropenem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders : angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders : Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Musculoskeletal Disorders : rhabdomyolysis. Hepatic Disorders : drug-induced liver injury."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.5 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first-generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second-generation offspring. Second-generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1,000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meropenem and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of meropenem have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Intra-abdominal Infections Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of meropenem in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of meropenem in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of meropenem, approximately 1,100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2,200 mg/kg to 4,000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Meropenem IV is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm.

Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9 : Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n=225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n=187) or ceftriaxone (n=34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. During therapy the patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10 ). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses.

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including meropenem for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When meropenem for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by meropenem for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with meropenem for injection. If treatment with meropenem for injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . sagent \u00ae Mfd. for SAGENT Pharmaceuticals Schaumburg, IL 60173 (USA) Made in China \u00a92025 Sagent Pharmaceuticals July 2025"

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: 4. Complicated skin and skin structure infections (adult patients and pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.1 ) 5. Complicated intra-abdominal infections (adult and pediatric patients). ( 1.2 ) 6. Bacterial meningitis (pediatric patients 3 months of age and older only). ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (Adult Patients and Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection, USP (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, viridans group streptococci , Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (Adult and Pediatric Patients) Meropenem for injection, USP (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of complicated appendicitis and peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Bacteroides fragilis , B. thetaiotaomicron , and Peptostreptococcus species. 1.3 Bacterial Meningitis (Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Only) Meropenem for injection, USP (I.V.) is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Meropenem for injection, USP (I.V.) has been found to be effective in eliminating concurrent bacteremia in association with bacterial meningitis. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Meropenem for injection, USP (I.V.) and other antibacterial drugs, Meropenem for injection, USP (I.V.) should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 7. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. ( 5.1 ) 8. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.). (5.2) 9. Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) 10. Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 11. Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) 12. In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) [ see AdverseReactions(6.2) ]. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 )and Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.4 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [ see Drug Interactions( 7.2 ) ]. 5.5 Clostridium difficile \u2013associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Meropenem for injection (I.V.), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.7 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.8 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 ) , Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) , Use in Specific Populations( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.9 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on a n outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) ]."

Adult Patients: During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours). Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem discontinued because of adverse events. Many patients in these trials were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The following adverse reaction frequencies were derived from the clinical trials in the 2904 patients treated with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site 2.4% Injection site reaction 0.9% Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis 0.8% Pain at the injection site 0.4% Edema at the injection site 0.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) occurring in greater than 1% of the patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse events that were reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and occurring in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding events were seen as follows: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%). Body as a Whole: pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, back pain, abdominal enlargement, chills, pelvic pain Cardiovascular: heart failure, heart arrest, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope Digestive System: oral moniliasis, anorexia, cholestatic jaundice/jaundice, flatulence, ileus, hepatic failure, dyspepsia, intestinal obstruction Hemic/Lymphatic: anemia, hypochromic anemia, hypervolemia Metabolic/Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoxia Nervous System: insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence, anxiety, depression, asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) and ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) ] Respiratory: respiratory disorder, dyspnea, pleural effusion, asthma, cough increased, lung edema Skin and Appendages: urticaria, sweating, skin ulcer Urogenital System: dysuria, kidney failure, vaginal moniliasis, urinary incontinence Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes that were reported and occurring in greater than 0.2% of the patients were as follows: Hepatic: increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin Hematologic: increased platelets, increased eosinophils, decreased platelets, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased white blood cell (WBC), shortened prothrombin time and shortened partial thromboplastin time, leukocytosis, hypokalemia Renal: increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Urinalysis: presence of red blood cells Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections In a study of complicated skin and skin structure infections, the adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. The most common adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of the patients were: headache (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), constipation (7%), diarrhea (7%), anemia (5.5%), and pain (5.1%). Adverse events with an incidence of greater than 1%, and not listed above, include: pharyngitis, accidental injury, gastrointestinal disorder, hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disorder, and pneumonia. Patients with Renal Impairment: For patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, the incidence of heart failure, kidney failure, seizure and shock reported with Meropenem for injection (I.V.), increased in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Pediatric Patients: Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 3.5% Rash 1.6% Nausea and Vomiting 0.8% Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis : Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse reactions reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and their rates of occurrence as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the Meropenem for injection (I.V.) treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Infants less than 3 months of Age): Meropenem for injection (I.V.) was studied in 200 neonates and infants less than 3 months of age. The study was open-label, uncontrolled, 98% of the infants received concomitant medications, and the majority of adverse events were reported in neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age and critically ill at baseline, making it difficult to assess the relationship of the adverse events to Meropenem for injection (I.V.). The adverse reactions seen in these patients that were reported and their rates of occurrence are as follows: Convulsion 5% Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated) 4.5% Vomiting 2.5% Adverse Laboratory Changes in Pediatric Patients: Laboratory changes seen in the pediatric studies, including the meningitis studies, were similar to those reported in the adult studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Worldwide post-marketing adverse reactions not otherwise listed in the Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials section of this prescribing information and reported as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related are listed within each body system in order of decreasing severity. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and leukopenia; a positive direct or indirect Coombs test, and hemolytic anemia. Immune System Disorders: angioedema. Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 3. Co-administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended ( 7.1 ) 4. The concomitant use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.4 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 2. Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is necessary, if creatinine clearance is 50 mL/min or less. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature 2 , intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Meropenem for Injection (I.V.) or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacterial meningitis, and for pediatric patients of all ages with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Skin and Skin Structure Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with complicated skin and skin structure infections is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies [ see Indications and Usage( 1.3 ) , Dosage and Administration( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies( 14.1 ) ]. Intra-abdominal Infections Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetics studies and controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age with intra-abdominal infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Bacterial Meningitis Use of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older with bacterial meningitis is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 ) , Warnings and Precautions( Error!

There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons)."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), approximately 1100 (30%) were 65 years of age and older, while 400 (11%) were 75 years and older. Additionally, in a study of 511 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, 93 (18%) were 65 years of age and older, while 38 (7%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; spontaneous reports and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Meropenem is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients has shown a reduction in the plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology( 12.4 ) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below.

Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion.Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log 10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only) Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Streptococcus pyogenes Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Peptostreptococcus species The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides ureolyticus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Parabacteroides distasonis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 23 mcg/mL (range 14 to 26) for the 500 mg dose and 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. A 5-minute intravenous bolus injection of Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in healthy volunteers results in mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 45 mcg/mL (range 18 to 65) for the 500 mg dose and 112 mcg/mL (range 83 to 140) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 500 mg administered every 8 hours or 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of Meropenem for injection (I.V.), the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 5 below. Table 5: Meropenem Concentrations in Selected Tissues (Highest Concentrations Reported) Tissue Intravenous Dose (gram) Number of Samples Mean [mcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] at 1 hour unless otherwise noted Range [mcg/mL or mcg/(gram)] Endometrium 0.5 7 4.2 1.7 to 10.2 Myometrium 0.5 15 3.8 0.4 to 8.1 Ovary 0.5 8 2.8 0.8 to 4.8 Cervix 0.5 2 7 5.4 to 8.5 Fallopian tube 0.5 9 1.7 0.3 to 3.4 Skin 0.5 22 3.3 0.5 to 12.6 Interstitial fluid obtained from blister fluid 0.5 9 5.5 3.2 to 8.6 Skin 1 10 5.3 1.3 to 16.7 Interstitial fluid 1 5 26.3 20.9 to 37.4 Colon 1 2 2.6 2.5 to 2.7 Bile 1 7 14.6 (3 hours) 4 to 25.7 Gall bladder 1 1 - 3.9 Peritoneal fluid 1 9 30.2 7.4 to 54.6 Lung 1 2 4.8 (2 hours) 1.4 to 8.2 Bronchial mucosa 1 7 4.5 1.3 to 11.1 Muscle 1 2 6. 1 (2 hours) 5.3 to 6.9 Fascia 1 9 8.8 1.5 to 20 Heart valves 1 7 9.7 6.4 to 12.1 Myocardium 1 10 15.5 5.2 to 25.5 CSF (inflamed) 20 mg/kg in pediatric patients of age 5 months to 8 years 40 mg/kg in pediatric patients of age 1 month to 15 years 8 5 1.1 (2 hours) 3.3 (3 hours) 0.2 to 2.8 0.9 to 6.5 CSF (uninflamed) 1 4 0.2 (2 hours) 0.1 to 0.3 Elimination In subjects with normal renal function, the elimination half-life of meropenem is approximately 1 hour. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion.Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic studies with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [ see Dosage and Administration( 2.2 )and Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ) ]. Meropenem I.V. is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [ see Overdosage( 10 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Geriatric Patients A pharmacokinetic study with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection I.V., in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

Mutagenesis: Genetic toxicity studies were performed with meropenem using the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Chinese hamster ovary HGPRT assay, cultured human lymphocytes cytogenic assay, and the mouse micronucleus test. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential found in any of these tests. Impairment of Fertility: In fertility studies, intravenous meropenem was administered to male rats beginning 11 weeks before mating and throughout mating and to female rats from 2 weeks before mating through Gestation Day 7 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparison, approximately 3.2 times to the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections including complicated cellulitis, complex abscesses, perirectal abscesses, and skin infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials, hospitalization, and surgical intervention were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, international, double-blind trial. The study evaluated meropenem at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours and imipenem-cilastatin at doses of 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 hours. The study compared the clinical response between treatment groups in the clinically evaluable population at the follow-up visit (test-of-cure). The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Canada, and Brazil. At enrollment, approximately 37% of the patients had underlying diabetes, 12% had underlying peripheral vascular disease and 67% had a surgical intervention. The study included 510 patients randomized to meropenem and 527 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin. Two hundred and sixty one (261) patients randomized to meropenem and 287 patients randomized to imipenem-cilastatin were clinically evaluable. The success rates in the clinically evaluable patients at the follow-up visit were 86% (225/261) in the meropenem arm and 83% (238/287) in imipenem-cilastatin arm. The success rates for the clinically evaluable population are provided in Table 7.

The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients at the post-treatment follow-up visit, with the percent cure in parentheses (Fully Evaluable analysis set).

Three controlled clinical studies of complicated intra-abdominal infections were performed in Europe; meropenem was compared with imipenem (two trials) and cefotaxime/metronidazole (one trial). Using strict evaluability criteria and microbiologic eradication and clinical cures at follow-up which occurred 7 or more days after completion of therapy, the presumptive microbiologic eradication/clinical cure rates and statistical findings are provided in Table 9: Table 9: Presumptive Microbiologic Eradication and Clinical Cure Rates at Test-of-Cure Visit in the Evaluable Population with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection Treatment Arm No. evaluable/ No. enrolled (%) Microbiologic Eradication Rate Clinical Cure Rate Outcome meropenem 146/516 (28%) 98/146 (67%) 101/146 (69%) imipenem 65/220 (30%) 40/65 (62%) 42/65 (65%) meropenem equivalent to control cefotaxime/ metronidazole 26/85 (30%) 22/26 (85%) 22/26 (85%) meropenem not equivalent to control clindamycin/ tobramycin 50/212 (24%) 38/50 (76%) 38/50 (76%) meropenem equivalent to control The finding that meropenem was not statistically equivalent to cefotaxime/metronidazole may have been due to uneven assignment of more seriously ill patients to the meropenem arm. Currently there is no additional information available to further interpret this observation. 14.3 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: 1 At the 5-7 week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits, hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness. 2 During therapy the patient\u2019s clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. 3 Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using the definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 10). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis MICROORGANISMS MEROPENEM FOR INJECTION (I.V.)

Five patients were found to be bacteriologically not cured, 3 in the comparator group (1 relapse and 2 patients with cerebral abscesses) and 2 in the meropenem group (1 relapse and 1 with continued growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). With respect to hearing loss, 263 of the 271 evaluable patients had at least one hearing test performed post-therapy. The following table shows the degree of hearing loss between the meropenem-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 1. Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for injection (I.V.) should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, take the medication exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for injection (I.V.) or other antibacterial drugs in the future. 2. Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.5 ) ]. 3. Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for injection (I.V.). If treatment with Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. 4. Patients receiving Meropenem for injection (I.V.) on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for injection (I.V.) is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ].

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving \u03b2-lactams. (5.1) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection. (5.2) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.3) Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment. (5.4) Co-administration of meropenem for injection with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. (5.5, 7.2) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis) has been reported. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.6) In patients with renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia has been observed (5.9) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with \u03b2-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another \u03b2-lactam. Before initiating therapy with meropenem for injection, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \u03b2-lactams, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to meropenem for injection occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), erythema multiforme (EM) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in patients receiving meropenem for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, meropenem should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue meropenem for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Seizure Potential Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem for injection. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)] . During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these included a prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and reexamine the dosage of meropenem for injection to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . 5.6 Clostridioides difficile - associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including meropenem for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing meropenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.8 Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms As with other broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of meropenem may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed but no clinical bleeding reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.10 Potential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving meropenem for injection on an outpatient basis regarding adverse events such as seizures,delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that meropenem for injection is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] ."

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months to less than 17 years of age) with bacterial meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The most common adverse reactions and their rates of occurrence were as follows: Diarrhea 4.7% Rash (mostly diaper area moniliasis) 3.1% Oral Moniliasis 1.9% Glossitis 1% In these studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem for injection and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem for injection-treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (seizures that occurred on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 patients in the comparator arm. The meropenem for injection group had a statistically higher number of patients than the comparator with transient elevation of liver enzymes. Adverse Reactions from Studies of Meropenem for Injection in Other Serious Bacterial Infections (not bacterial meningitis) The following adverse reactions occurred in studies of 2,904 immunocompetent adult patients who received meropenem for injection (500 mg or 1 gram every 8 hours) for the treatment of other serious bacterial infections (not bacterial meningitis). This meropenem for injection product is indicated only for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by certain organisms in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older [see Indications and Usage (1.1)] . Many patients in these studies were severely ill and had multiple background diseases, physiological impairments and were receiving multiple other drug therapies. In the seriously ill patient population, it was not possible to determine the relationship between observed adverse events and therapy with meropenem for injection. Deaths in 5 patients were assessed as possibly related to meropenem for injection; 36 (1.2%) patients had meropenem for injection discontinued because of adverse events. Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions that were reported with meropenem for injection were as follows: Inflammation at the injection site (2.4%), injection site reaction (0.9%), phlebitis/thrombophlebitis (0.8%), pain at the injection site (0.4%), and edema at the injection site (0.2%). Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 1% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea/vomiting (3.6%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%), sepsis (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), apnea (1.3%), shock (1.2%), and pruritus (1.2%). Additional systemic adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 1% but greater than 0.1% of the meropenem for injection-treated patients are listed below within each body system in order of decreasing frequency: Bleeding Event s : gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), hemoperitoneum (0.2%).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of meropenem for injection with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and therefore Meropenem for Injection is not recommended. (7.1) The concomitant use of Meropenem for Injection and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium (5.4, 7.2) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid\u2019s glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem for injection is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with meropenem in pregnant women. No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 2.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Meropenem administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17) in intravenous doses of 240, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the MRHD of 1 gram every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison). Meropenem administered intravenously to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis from Day 20 to 50 after mating at doses of 120, 240, and 360 mg/kg/day did not produce maternal or fetal toxicity at the NOAEL dose of 360 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.3 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison). In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature1, intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Lactation Day 21 at doses of 240, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenemrelated effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem on the breast-fed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meropenem for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from meropenem for injection or from the underlying maternal conditions. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have been established for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria meningitidis and penicillin-susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae , and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem for Injection have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In mice and rats, large intravenous doses of meropenem (2200 mg/kg to 4000 mg/kg) have been associated with ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions, and mortalities. Intentional overdosing of meropenem for injection is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Meropenem is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The percentage of time of a dosing interval that unbound plasma concentration of meropenem exceeds the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma Concentrations At the end of a 30-minute intravenous infusion of a single dose of meropenem for injection in healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma concentrations of meropenem are approximately 49 mcg/mL (range 39 to 58) for the 1 gram dose. Following intravenous doses of 500 mg, mean plasma concentrations of meropenem usually decline to approximately 1 mcg/mL at 6 hours after administration. No accumulation of meropenem in plasma was observed with regimens using 1 gram administered every 6 hours in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Distribution The plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. After a single intravenous dose of meropenem for injection, the highest mean concentrations of meropenem were found in tissues and fluids at 1 hour (0.5 hours to 1.5 hours) after the start of infusion, except where indicated in the tissues and fluids listed in Table 2 below.

The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients 3 months to 2 years of age. Metabolism There is one metabolite of meropenem that is microbiologically inactive. Excretion Meropenem is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Approximately 70% (50% to 75%) of the dose is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A further 28% is recovered as the microbiologically inactive metabolite. Fecal elimination represents only approximately 2% of the dose. The measured renal clearance and the effect of probenecid show that meropenem undergoes both filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary concentrations of meropenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL are maintained for up to 5 hours after a 500 mg dose. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with meropenem for injection in adult patients with renal impairment have shown that the reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. The effect of renal impairment on the PK of meropenem has not been studied in the pediatric patients. Therefore, there is no experience in pediatric patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Drug Interaction Studies Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding-protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus . Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log10 reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1-2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , against which lethal activity is not observed. Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Resistance There are several mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems: 1) decreased permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria (due to diminished production of porins) causing reduced bacterial uptake, 2) reduced affinity of the target PBPs, 3) increased expression of efflux pump components, and 4) production of antibacterial drug-destroying enzymes (carbapenemases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases). Cross-resistance is sometimes observed with isolates resistant to other carbapenems. Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro tests show meropenem to act synergistically with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs against some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antimicrobial Activity Meropenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for meropenem against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of meropenem in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter cloacae Hafnia alvei Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides uniformis Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium difficile Clostridium perfringens Eggerthella lenta Fusobacterium species Prevotella intermedia Prevotella melaninogenica Propionibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Bacterial Meningitis Four hundred forty-six patients (397 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 17 years of age) were enrolled in 4 separate clinical trials and randomized to treatment with meropenem for injection (n = 225) at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, i.e., cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable (ranging from 61 to 68%) and with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture. A patient was defined as clinically not cured if any one of the following three criteria were met: At the 57-week post-completion of therapy visit, the patient had any one of the following: moderate to severe motor, behavior or development deficits; hearing loss of greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears; or blindness. During therapy the patients clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs. Either during or post-therapy, the patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse. Using these criteria, the following efficacy rates were obtained, per organism (noted in Table 3). The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses. Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Antibacterial Resistance Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Meropenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Meropenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Meropenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Diarrhea Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Counsel patients to inform their physician if they are taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Valproic acid concentrations in the blood may drop below the therapeutic range upon co-administration with Meropenem for Injection. If treatment with Meropenem for Injection is necessary and continued, alternative or supplemental anti-convulsant medication to prevent and/or treat seizures may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Potential of Neuromotor Impairment Patients receiving Meropenem for Injection on an outpatient basis must be alerted of adverse events such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that Meropenem for Injection is well tolerated, patients should not operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] .
