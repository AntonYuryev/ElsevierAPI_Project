Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is in a multiple-dose vial. Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is a clear and colorless to yellow solution. Store bendamustine hydrochloride injection at recommended refrigerated storage conditions (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). When refrigerated the contents may freeze. Allow the vial to reach room temperature (15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) prior to use. Observe the contents of the vial for any visible solid or particulate matter and discoloration. Do not use the product if solid or particulate matter is observed after reaching room temperature. Intravenous Infusion Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dose from the 25 mg/mL solution as per Table A below and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of one of the following diluents: - 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or - 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The resulting final concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride injection in the infusion bag should be within 0.05 mg/mL to 0.7 mg/mL. After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. The admixture should be a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Use either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for dilution, as outlined above. No other diluents have been shown to be compatible. Table A: Volume (mL) of Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection required for dilution into 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 0.45% Sodium Chloride/2.5% Dextrose Injection, USP for a given dose (mg/m 2 ) and Body Surface Area (m 2 ) Body Surface Area (m 2 ) Volume of Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection to withdraw (mL) 120 mg/m 2 90 mg/m 2 60 mg/m 2 1 4.8 3.6 2.4 1.1 5.3 4 2.6 1.2 5.8 4.3 2.9 1.3 6.2 4.7 3.1 1.4 6.7 5 3.4 1.5 7.2 5.4 3.6 1.6 7.7 5.8 3.8 1.7 8.2 6.1 4.1 1.8 8.6 6.5 4.3 1.9 9.1 6.8 4.6 2 9.6 7.2 4.8 2.1 10.1 7.6 5 2.2 10.6 7.9 5.3 2.3 11 8.3 5.5 2.4 11.5 8.6 5.8 2.5 12 9 6 2.6 12.5 9.4 6.2 2.7 13 9.7 6.5 2.8 13.4 10.1 6.7 2.9 13.9 10.4 7 3 14.4 10.8 7.2 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any unused solution should be discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics. 2.3 Admixture Stability Bendamustine hydrochloride injection contains no antimicrobial preservative. The admixture should be prepared as close as possible to the time of patient administration. If diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours when stored refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) or for 3 hours when stored at room temperature (15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) and room light. Administration of diluted bendamustine hydrochloride injection must be completed within this period of time. Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is supplied in a multiple-dose vial. Retain the partially used vial in original package to protect from light and store refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) if additional dose withdrawal from the same vial is intended. 2.4 Stability of Partially Used Vials (Needle Punched Vials) Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is supplied as a multiple-dose vial. Although it does not contain any antimicrobial preservative, bendamustine hydrochloride injection is bacteriostatic. The partially used vials are stable for up to 28 days when stored in its original carton under refrigeration (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression: Delay or reduce dose and restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. ( 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for fever and other signs of infection or reactivation of infections and treat promptly. ( 5.2 ) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): Monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms suggestive of PML. ( 5.3 ) Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe anaphylactic reactions have occurred. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. ( 5.4 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: May lead to acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures in patients at high risk. ( 5.5 ) Skin Reactions: Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS, DRESS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. ( 5.8 ) Extravasation Injury: Take precautions to avoid extravasation, including monitoring intravenous infusion site during and after administration. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3 to 4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV). Bendamustine hydrochloride injection causes myelosuppression. Monitor complete blood counts, including leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.2 Infections Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for bendamustine hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2)] . Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following bendamustine hydrochloride injection treatment to contact a physician immediately if they have symptoms or signs of infection. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride injection are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration. 5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have occurred following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride, primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, withhold bendamustine hydrochloride injection treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 5.4 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride injection for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusion reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in post-marketing reports [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 5.6 Skin Reactions Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including toxic skin reactions [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), bullous exanthema, and rash [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 )]. Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol. Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride injection. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Combination therapy, progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy. Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during bendamustine hydrochloride injection therapy. 5.8 Other Malignancies There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, bronchial carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for the development of secondary malignancies. Perform dermatologic evaluations during and after treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection. 5.9 Extravasation Injury Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in postmarketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Assure good venous access prior to starting bendamustine hydrochloride injection infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of bendamustine hydrochloride injection. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, bendamustine hydrochloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine (that approximated the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] ."

( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (\u226515%) for NHL are lymphopenia, leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia, constipation, anorexia, cough, headache, weight decreased, dyspnea, rash, and stomatitis.( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in NHL The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31 to 84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and <1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles. The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (\u226530%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u22655%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions. Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic systems disorders : Pancytopenia Cardiovascular disorders : Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation General disorders and administration site conditions : Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling) Immune system disorders : Anaphylaxis Infections and infestations : Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Infertility: May impair fertility. ( 8.3 ) Renal Impairment: Do not use in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Do not use in patients with total bilirubin 1.5-3 x ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 x ULN, or total bilirubin >3 x ULN. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies, intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.6 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) resulted in embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, structural abnormalities, and alterations to growth (see Data). There are no available data on bendamustine hydrochloride use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to mice from 210 mg/m 2 (approximately 1.8 times the MRHD) during organogenesis and caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (exencephaly, cleft palates, accessory rib, and spinal deformities) and decreased fetal body weights. This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated. Repeat intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine hydrochloride in mice on gestation days 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.6 times the MRHD) and an increase in abnormalities from 112.5 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.9 times the MRHD), similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to rats from 120 mg/m 2 (approximately the MRHD) on gestation days 4, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in external (effect on tail, head, and herniation of external organs [exomphalos]) and internal (hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus) malformations were seen in dosed rats. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bendamustine hydrochloride or its metabolites in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection, and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Bendamustine hydrochloride injection can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection. Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Based on findings from clinical studies, bendamustine hydrochloride injection may impair male fertility. Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents, especially in combination with other drugs. In some instances, spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission, but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued. Advise patients of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities. Based on findings from animal studies, bendamustine hydrochloride injection may impair male fertility due to an increase in morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. The long-term effects of bendamustine hydrochloride injection on male fertility, including the reversibility of adverse effects, have not been studied [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy were assessed in a single open-label trial (NCT01088984) in patients aged 1 to 19 years with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient. The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age and younger patients. No overall differences in efficacy in patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride injection in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 mL/min. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride injection in patients with AST or ALT 2.5 to 10 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C max . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m 2 /day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C max typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied. Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94% to 96% and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 mcg/mL. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg/m 2 of bendamustine over 1 hour, the intermediate half-life (t \u00bd ) of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean terminal elimination t \u00bd of two active metabolites, \u03b3-hydroxybendamustine (M3) and N-desmethylbendamustine (M4) are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/min. Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways. Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro . Two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro . M3 and M4 concentrations of these metabolites in plasma are 1/10 th and 1/100 th that of the parent compound, respectively. Excretion Following IV infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in cancer patients, approximately 76% of the dose was recovered. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine (3.3% unchanged) and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age (31 to 84 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u2265 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown. Race/Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects (n=6) were 40% higher than that in non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Effect of Bendamustine on CYP Substrates Bendamustine did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5. Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5.

Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 , on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles. The median age was 60 years, 65% were male, and 95% had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma (62%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (21%), and marginal zone lymphoma (16%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy, 91% of patients had received previous alkylator therapy, and 97% of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) and included overall response rate (complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response) and duration of response (DR) as summarized in Table 6.

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection (25 mg/vial or 100 mg/vial lyophilized powder) If a closed system transfer device or adapter that contains polycarbonate or ABS is to be used as supplemental protection during preparation 1 , only use Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection, the lyophilized formulation. Each vial of Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection is intended for single-dose only. Aseptically reconstitute each Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection vial as follows: 25 mg Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection vial: Add 5 mL of only Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 100 mg Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection vial: Add 20 mL of only Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Shake well to yield a clear, colorless to a pale yellow solution with a bendamustine HCl concentration of 5 mg/mL. The lyophilized powder should completely dissolve in 5 minutes. The reconstituted solution must be transferred to the infusion bag within 30 minutes of reconstitution. If particulate matter is observed, the reconstituted product should not be used. Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dose (based on 5 mg/mL concentration) and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline). As an alternative to 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), a 500 mL infusion bag of 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be considered. The resulting final concentration of bendamustine HCl in the infusion bag should be within 0.2 to 0.6 mg/mL. After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. Visually inspect the filled syringe and the prepared infusion bag to ensure the lack of visible particulate matter prior to administration. The admixture should be a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Use Sterile Water for Injection, USP, for reconstitution and then either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for dilution, as outlined above. No other diluents have been shown to be compatible. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any unused solution should be discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics. 2.5 Admixture Stability Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection contains no antimicrobial preservative. The admixture should be prepared as close as possible to the time of patient administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection (25 mg/vial or 100 mg/vial lyophilized powder) Once diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours stored under refrigerated conditions at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) or for 3 hours when stored at room temperature (15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) and room light. Administration of reconstituted and diluted Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection must be completed within this period."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression: Delay or reduce dose and restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. ( 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for fever and other signs of infection or reactivation of infections and treat promptly. ( 5.2 ) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): Monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms suggestive of PML.( 5.3 ) Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe and anaphylactic reactions have occurred; monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. ( 5.4 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: May lead to acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures in patients at high risk. ( 5.5 ) Skin Reactions: Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS, DRESS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. ( 5.8 ) Extravasation Injury: Take precautions to avoid extravasation, including monitoring intravenous infusion site during and after administration. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV). Monitor complete blood counts, including leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 )] 5.2 Infections Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following bendamustine hydrochloride treatment to contact a physician if they have symptoms or signs of infection. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration. 5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have occurred following treatment with bendamustine, primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, withhold bendamustine hydrochloride treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 5.4 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusions reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . 5.6 Skin Reactions Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including toxic skin reactions [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)], bullous exanthema, and rash [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol. Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Combination therapy, progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy. Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during bendamustine therapy. 5.8 Other Malignancies There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, bronchial carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for the development of secondary malignancies. Perform dermatologic evaluations during and after treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.9 Extravasation Injury Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in postmarketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Assure good venous access prior to starting bendamustine hydrochloride infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine (that approximated the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Bendamustine hydrochloride and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]"

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 153 patients. Bendamustine hydrochloride was studied in an active-controlled, randomized trial. The population was 45-77 years of age, 63% male, 100% white, and had treatment na\u00efve CLL. All patients started the study at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days. Adverse reactions were reported according to NCI CTC v.2.0. In the randomized CLL clinical study, non-hematologic adverse reactions (any grade) in the bendamustine hydrochloride group that occurred with a frequency greater than 15% were pyrexia (24%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (16%). Other adverse reactions seen frequently in one or more studies included asthenia, fatigue, malaise, and weakness; dry mouth; somnolence; cough; constipation; headache; mucosal inflammation and stomatitis. Worsening hypertension was reported in 4 patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride in the randomized CLL clinical study and in none treated with chlorambucil. Three of these 4 adverse reactions were described as a hypertensive crisis and were managed with oral medications and resolved. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal for patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride were hypersensitivity (2%) and pyrexia (1%). Table 1 contains the treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of attribution, that were reported in \u2265 5% of patients in either treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study.

Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients. Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride may also have changes in their creatinine levels. If abnormalities are detected, monitoring of these parameters should be continued to ensure that further deterioration does not occur. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31-84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and <1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles. The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (\u226530%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u22655%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

NOTE: Patients counted only once in each adverse reaction category and once in each body system category. Hematologic toxicities, based on laboratory values and CTC grade, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined are described in Table 4. Clinically important chemistry laboratory values that were new or worsened from baseline and occurred in >1% of patients at Grade 3 or 4, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined were hyperglycemia (3%), elevated creatinine (2%), hyponatremia (2%), and hypocalcemia (2%).

The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions. Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic systems disorders: Pancytopenia Cardiovascular disorders: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation General disorders and administration site conditions: Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling) Immune system disorders: Anaphylaxis Infections and infestations: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Infertility: May impair fertility. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies, intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.6 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) resulted in embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, structural abnormalities, and alterations to growth (see Data) . There are no available data on bendamustine hydrochloride use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal data Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to mice from 210 mg/m 2 (approximately 1.8 times the MRHD) during organogenesis and caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (exencephaly, cleft palates, accessory rib, and spinal deformities), and decreased fetal body weights. This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated. Repeat intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine hydrochloride to mice on gestation days 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.6 times the MRHD) and an increase in abnormalities from 112.5 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.9 times the MRHD), similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to rats from 120 mg/m 2 (approximately the MRHD) on gestation days 4, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in external (effect on tail, head, and herniation of external organs [exomphalos]) and internal (hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus) malformations were seen in dosed rats. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bendamustine hydrochloride or its metabolites in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride, and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride. Contraception Females Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Males Based on findings from clinical studies, bendamustine hydrochloride may impair male fertility. Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents, especially in combination with other drugs. In some instances spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission, but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued. Patients should be warned of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities. Based on findings from animal studies, bendamustine hydrochloride may impair male fertility due to an increase in morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. The long-term effects of bendamustine hydrochloride on male fertility, including the reversibility of adverse effects, have not been studied [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy were assessed in a single open-label trial (NCT01088984) in patients aged 1 to 19 years with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient in the Phase 2 portion of the trial at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 . However, 2 patients with ALL achieved CR at a dose of 90 mg/m 2 in the Phase 1 portion of the study. The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age and younger patients. Efficacy was lower in patients 65 and over with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride based upon an overall response rate of 47% for patients 65 and over and 70% for younger patients. Progression free survival was also longer in younger patients with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride (19 months vs. 12 months). No overall differences in efficacy in patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 mL/min. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN (see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C max . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m 2 /day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post-infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C max typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied. Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94 to 96% and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 \u00b5g/mL. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 \u00b5g/mL. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg/m 2 of bendamustine over 1 hour, the intermediate half-life (t \u00bd ) of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean terminal elimination t \u00bd of two active metabolites, \u03b3-hydroxybendamustine (M3) and N desmethylbendamustine (M4) are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/min. Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways . Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro. Two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro. M3 and M4 concentrations in plasma are 1/10 th and 1/100 th that of the parent compound, respectively. Excretion Following IV infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in cancer patients, approximately 76% of the dose was recovered. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine (3.3% unchanged) and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age (31 to 84 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u2265 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown. Race/Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects (n=6) were 40% higher than that in non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Effect of Bendamustine on CYP Substrates Bendamustine did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5. Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5. Effect of Transporters on Bendamustine Hydrochloride Bendamustine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown."

Oral administration at 187.5 mg/m 2 /day (the only dose tested, approximately 1.6 times the MRHD) for 4 days induced mammary carcinomas and pulmonary adenomas. Bendamustine is a mutagen and clastogen. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay), bendamustine was shown to increase revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Bendamustine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes in vitro, and in rat bone marrow cells in vivo (increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes) from 37.5 mg/m 2 (the lowest dose tested, approximately 0.3 times the MRHD). Bendamustine induced morphologic abnormalities in spermatozoa in mice.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) The safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride were evaluated in an open-label, randomized, controlled multicenter trial comparing bendamustine hydrochloride to chlorambucil. The trial was conducted in 301 previously-untreated patients with Binet Stage B or C (Rai Stages I - IV) CLL requiring treatment. Need-to-treat criteria included hematopoietic insufficiency, B-symptoms, rapidly progressive disease or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy. Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Richter\u2019s syndrome, or transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. The patient populations in the bendamustine hydrochloride and chlorambucil treatment groups were balanced with regard to the following baseline characteristics: age (median 63 vs. 66 years), gender (63% vs. 61% male), Binet stage (71% vs. 69% Binet B), lymphadenopathy (79% vs. 82%), enlarged spleen (76% vs. 80%), enlarged liver (48% vs. 46%), hypercellular bone marrow (79% vs. 73%), \u201cB\u201d symptoms (51% vs. 53%), lymphocyte count (mean 65.7x10 9 /L vs. 65.1x10 9 /L), and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (mean 370.2 vs. 388.4 U/L). Ninety percent of patients in both treatment groups had immuno-phenotypic confirmation of CLL (CD5, CD23 and either CD19 or CD20 or both). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bendamustine hydrochloride at 100 mg/m 2 , administered intravenously over a period of 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 or chlorambucil at 0.8 mg/kg (Broca\u2019s normal weight) administered orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Efficacy endpoints of objective response rate and progression-free survival were calculated using a pre-specified algorithm based on NCI working group criteria for CLL. The results of this open-label randomized study demonstrated a higher rate of overall response and a longer progression-free survival for bendamustine hydrochloride compared to chlorambucil (see Table 5). Survival data are not mature.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival comparing bendamustine hydrochloride with chlorambucil are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Progression-Free Survival 14.2 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single arm study of 100 patients with indolent B-cell NHL that had progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 , on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles. The median age was 60 years, 65% were male, and 95% had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma (62%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (21%), and marginal zone lymphoma (16%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy, 91% of patients had received previous alkylator therapy, and 97% of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) and included overall response rate (complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response) and duration of response (DR) as summarized in Table 6. Table 6: Efficacy Data for NHL* Bendamustine hydrochloride (N=100) Response Rate (%) Overall response rate (CR+CRu+PR) 74 (95% CI) (64.3, 82.3) Complete response (CR) 13 Complete response unconfirmed (CRu) 4 Partial response (PR) 57 Duration of Response (DR) Median, months (95% CI) 9.2 months (7.1, 10.8) CI = confidence interval *IRC assessment was based on modified International Working Group response criteria (IWG-RC).

Bendamustine hydrochloride Injection and the reconstituted Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection have different concentrations of bendamustine hydrochloride. The concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride in the solution is 90 mg/mL and the concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride in the reconstituted solution of lyophilized powder is 5 mg/mL. Do not mix or combine the two formulations. If a closed system transfer device (CSTD) or adapter that contains polycarbonate or acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) is used as supplemental protection prior to dilution 1 , only use Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection, the lyophilized powder formulation [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . 2.2 Dosing Instructions for CLL Recommended Dosage: The recommended dose is 100 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 28-day cycle, up to 6 cycles. Dose Delays, Dose Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy for CLL: Delay Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection administration in the event of Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or clinically significant \u2265 Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity. Once non-hematologic toxicity has recovered to less than or equal to Grade 1 and/or the blood counts have improved [Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L, platelets \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L], reinitiate Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection at the discretion of the treating physician. In addition, consider dose reduction. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 50 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 25 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicity: for clinically significant Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 50 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Consider dose re-escalation in subsequent cycles at the discretion of the treating physician. 2.3 Dosing Instructions for NHL Recommended Dosage: The recommended dose is 120 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day cycle, up to 8 cycles. Dose Delays, Dose Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy for NHL: Delay Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection administration in the event of a Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or clinically significant greater than or equal to Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity. Once non-hematologic toxicity has recovered to \u2264 Grade 1 and/or the blood counts have improved [Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L, platelets \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L], reinitiate Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection at the discretion of the treating physician. In addition, consider dose reduction. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 4 toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 4 toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration Bendamustine hydrochloride is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection (25 mg/vial or 100 mg/vial lyophilized powder) If a closed system transfer device or adapter that contains polycarbonate or ABS is to be used as supplemental protection during preparation 1 , only use Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection, the lyophilized formulation. Each vial of Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection is intended for single-dose only. Aseptically reconstitute each Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection vial as follows: 25 mg Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection vial: Add 5 mL of only Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 100 mg Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection vial: Add 20 mL of only Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Shake well to yield a clear, colorless to a pale yellow solution with a bendamustine HCl concentration of 5 mg/mL. The lyophilized powder should completely dissolve in 5 minutes. The reconstituted solution must be transferred to the infusion bag within 30 minutes of reconstitution. If particulate matter is observed, the reconstituted product should not be used. Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dose (based on 5 mg/mL concentration) and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline). As an alternative to 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), a 500 mL infusion bag of 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be considered. The resulting final concentration of bendamustine HCl in the infusion bag should be within 0.2 to 0.6 mg/mL. After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. Visually inspect the filled syringe and the prepared infusion bag to ensure the lack of visible particulate matter prior to administration. The admixture should be a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Use Sterile Water for Injection, USP, for reconstitution and then either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for dilution, as outlined above. No other diluents have been shown to be compatible. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any unused solution should be discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics. 2.5 Admixture Stability Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection contains no antimicrobial preservative. The admixture should be prepared as close as possible to the time of patient administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection (25 mg/vial or 100 mg/vial lyophilized powder) Once diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours stored under refrigerated conditions at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) or for 3 hours when stored at room temperature (15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) and room light. Administration of reconstituted and diluted Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection must be completed within this period."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression: Delay or reduce dose and restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. ( 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for fever and other signs of infection or reactivation of infections and treat promptly. ( 5.2 ) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): Monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms suggestive of PML.( 5.3 ) Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe and anaphylactic reactions have occurred; monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. ( 5.4 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: May lead to acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures in patients at high risk. ( 5.5 ) Skin Reactions: Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS, DRESS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. ( 5.8 ) Extravasation Injury: Take precautions to avoid extravasation, including monitoring intravenous infusion site during and after administration. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV). Monitor complete blood counts, including leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 )] 5.2 Infections Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with Bendamustine hydrochloride for Injection are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following bendamustine hydrochloride treatment to contact a physician if they have symptoms or signs of infection. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration. 5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have occurred following treatment with bendamustine, primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, withhold bendamustine hydrochloride treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 5.4 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusions reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . 5.6 Skin Reactions Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including toxic skin reactions [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)], bullous exanthema, and rash [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol. Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Combination therapy, progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy. Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during bendamustine therapy. 5.8 Other Malignancies There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, bronchial carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients for the development of secondary malignancies. Perform dermatologic evaluations during and after treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.9 Extravasation Injury Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in postmarketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Assure good venous access prior to starting bendamustine hydrochloride infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine (that approximated the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Bendamustine hydrochloride and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]"

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 153 patients. Bendamustine hydrochloride was studied in an active-controlled, randomized trial. The population was 45-77 years of age, 63% male, 100% white, and had treatment na\u00efve CLL. All patients started the study at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days. Adverse reactions were reported according to NCI CTC v.2.0. In the randomized CLL clinical study, non-hematologic adverse reactions (any grade) in the bendamustine hydrochloride group that occurred with a frequency greater than 15% were pyrexia (24%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (16%). Other adverse reactions seen frequently in one or more studies included asthenia, fatigue, malaise, and weakness; dry mouth; somnolence; cough; constipation; headache; mucosal inflammation and stomatitis. Worsening hypertension was reported in 4 patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride in the randomized CLL clinical study and in none treated with chlorambucil. Three of these 4 adverse reactions were described as a hypertensive crisis and were managed with oral medications and resolved. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal for patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride were hypersensitivity (2%) and pyrexia (1%). Table 1 contains the treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of attribution, that were reported in \u2265 5% of patients in either treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study.

Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients. Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride may also have changes in their creatinine levels. If abnormalities are detected, monitoring of these parameters should be continued to ensure that further deterioration does not occur. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31-84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and <1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles. The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (\u226530%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u22655%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

Clinically important chemistry laboratory values that were new or worsened from baseline and occurred in >1% of patients at Grade 3 or 4, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined were hyperglycemia (3%), elevated creatinine (2%), hyponatremia (2%), and hypocalcemia (2%). Table 4: Incidence of Hematology Laboratory Abnormalities in Patients Who Received bendamustine hydrochloride in the NHL Studies Percent of patients Hematology variable All Grades Grade 3/4 Lymphocytes Decreased 99 94 Leukocytes Decreased 94 56 Hemoglobin Decreased 88 11 Neutrophils Decreased 86 60 Platelets Decreased 86 25 In both studies, serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported in 37% of patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride. The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions.Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic systems disorders: Pancytopenia Cardiovascular disorders: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation General disorders and administration site conditions: Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling) Immune system disorders: Anaphylaxis Infections and infestations: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Infertility: May impair fertility. ( 8.3 ) Renal Impairment: Do not use in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Do not use in patients with total bilirubin 1.5-3 x ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 x ULN, or total bilirubin >3 x ULN. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies, intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.6 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) resulted in embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, structural abnormalities, and alterations to growth (see Data) . There are no available data on bendamustine hydrochloride use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal data Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to mice from 210 mg/m 2 (approximately 1.8 times the MRHD) during organogenesis and caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (exencephaly, cleft palates, accessory rib, and spinal deformities), and decreased fetal body weights. This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated. Repeat intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine hydrochloride to mice on gestation days 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.6 times the MRHD) and an increase in abnormalities from 112.5 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.9 times the MRHD), similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to rats from 120 mg/m 2 (approximately the MRHD) on gestation days 4, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in external (effect on tail, head, and herniation of external organs [exomphalos]) and internal (hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus) malformations were seen in dosed rats. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bendamustine hydrochloride or its metabolites in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride, and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride. Contraception Females Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Males Based on findings from clinical studies, bendamustine hydrochloride may impair male fertility. Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents, especially in combination with other drugs. In some instances spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission, but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued. Patients should be warned of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities. Based on findings from animal studies, bendamustine hydrochloride may impair male fertility due to an increase in morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. The long-term effects of bendamustine hydrochloride on male fertility, including the reversibility of adverse effects, have not been studied [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy were assessed in a single open-label trial (NCT01088984) in patients aged 1 to 19 years with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient in the Phase 2 portion of the trial at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 . However, 2 patients with ALL achieved CR at a dose of 90 mg/m 2 in the Phase 1 portion of the study. The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age and younger patients. Efficacy was lower in patients 65 and over with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride based upon an overall response rate of 47% for patients 65 and over and 70% for younger patients. Progression free survival was also longer in younger patients with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride (19 months vs. 12 months). No overall differences in efficacy in patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 mL/min. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN (see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]"

Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient in the Phase 2 portion of the trial at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 . However, 2 patients with ALL achieved CR at a dose of 90 mg/m 2 in the Phase 1 portion of the study. The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The intravenous LD 50 of bendamustine HCl is 240 mg/m 2 in the mouse and rat. Toxicities included sedation, tremor, ataxia, convulsions and respiratory distress. Across all clinical experience, the reported maximum single dose received was 280 mg/m 2 . Three of four patients treated at this dose showed ECG changes considered dose-limiting at 7 and 21 days post-dosing. These changes included QT prolongation (one patient), sinus tachycardia (one patient), ST and T wave deviations (two patients) and left anterior fascicular block (one patient). Cardiac enzymes and ejection fractions remained normal in all patients. No specific antidote for bendamustine hydrochloride overdose is known. Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures, including monitoring of hematologic parameters and ECGs."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C max . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m 2 /day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post-infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C max typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied. Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94 to 96% and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 \u00b5g/mL. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 \u00b5g/mL. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg/m 2 of bendamustine over 1 hour, the intermediate half-life (t \u00bd ) of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean terminal elimination t \u00bd of two active metabolites, \u03b3-hydroxybendamustine (M3) and N desmethylbendamustine (M4) are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/min. Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways . Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro. Two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro. M3 and M4 concentrations in plasma are 1/10 th and 1/100 th that of the parent compound, respectively. Excretion Following IV infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in cancer patients, approximately 76% of the dose was recovered. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine (3.3% unchanged) and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age (31 to 84 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u2265 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown. Race/Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects (n=6) were 40% higher than that in non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Effect of Bendamustine on CYP Substrates Bendamustine did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5. Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5. Effect of Transporters on Bendamustine Hydrochloride Bendamustine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) The safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride were evaluated in an open-label, randomized, controlled multicenter trial comparing bendamustine hydrochloride to chlorambucil. The trial was conducted in 301 previously-untreated patients with Binet Stage B or C (Rai Stages I - IV) CLL requiring treatment. Need-to-treat criteria included hematopoietic insufficiency, B-symptoms, rapidly progressive disease or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy. Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Richter\u2019s syndrome, or transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. The patient populations in the bendamustine hydrochloride and chlorambucil treatment groups were balanced with regard to the following baseline characteristics: age (median 63 vs. 66 years), gender (63% vs. 61% male), Binet stage (71% vs. 69% Binet B), lymphadenopathy (79% vs. 82%), enlarged spleen (76% vs. 80%), enlarged liver (48% vs. 46%), hypercellular bone marrow (79% vs. 73%), \u201cB\u201d symptoms (51% vs. 53%), lymphocyte count (mean 65.7x10 9 /L vs. 65.1x10 9 /L), and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (mean 370.2 vs. 388.4 U/L). Ninety percent of patients in both treatment groups had immuno-phenotypic confirmation of CLL (CD5, CD23 and either CD19 or CD20 or both). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bendamustine hydrochloride at 100 mg/m 2 , administered intravenously over a period of 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 or chlorambucil at 0.8 mg/kg (Broca\u2019s normal weight) administered orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Efficacy endpoints of objective response rate and progression-free survival were calculated using a pre-specified algorithm based on NCI working group criteria for CLL. The results of this open-label randomized study demonstrated a higher rate of overall response and a longer progression-free survival for bendamustine hydrochloride compared to chlorambucil (see Table 5). Survival data are not mature.

Progression-Free Survival 14.2 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single arm study of 100 patients with indolent B-cell NHL that had progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 , on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles. The median age was 60 years, 65% were male, and 95% had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma (62%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (21%), and marginal zone lymphoma (16%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy, 91% of patients had received previous alkylator therapy, and 97% of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) and included overall response rate (complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response) and duration of response (DR) as summarized in Table 6.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myelosuppression: Delay or reduce dose, and restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Infections: Monitor for fever and other signs of infection or reactivation of infections and treat promptly. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): Monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms suggestive of PML. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe anaphylactic reactions have occurred. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: May lead to acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures in patients at high risk. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Skin Reactions: Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS, DRESS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Extravasation Injury: Take precautions to avoid extravasation, including monitoring intravenous infusion site during and after administration. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV). Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection causes myelosuppression. Monitor complete blood counts, including leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 )]. 5.2 Infections Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for bendamustine hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection treatment to contact a physician immediately if they have symptoms or signs of infection. Patients treated with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration. 5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have occurred following treatment with bendamustine, primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, withhold Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 5.4 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusion reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in post-marketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. 5.6 Skin Reactions Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including toxic skin reactions [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), bullous exanthema, and rash [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2) ]. Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol. Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection. Combination therapy, progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy. Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection therapy. 5.8 Other Malignancies There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, bronchial carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for the development of secondary malignancies. Perform dermatologic evaluations during and after treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection. 5.9 Extravasation Injury Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in postmarketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Assure good venous access prior to starting Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine (that approximated the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]."

Clinical Trials Experience in CLL The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 153 patients. Bendamustine hydrochloride was studied in an active-controlled, randomized trial. The population was 45-77 years of age, 63% male, 100% white, and had treatment na\u00efve CLL. All patients started the study at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days. Adverse reactions were reported according to NCI CTC v.2.0. In the randomized CLL clinical study, non-hematologic adverse reactions (any grade) in the bendamustine hydrochloride group that occurred with a frequency greater than 15% were pyrexia (24%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (16%). Other adverse reactions seen frequently in one or more studies included asthenia, fatigue, malaise, and weakness; dry mouth; somnolence; cough; constipation; headache; mucosal inflammation and stomatitis. Worsening hypertension was reported in 4 patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride in the randomized CLL clinical study and in none treated with chlorambucil. Three of these 4 adverse reactions were described as a hypertensive crisis and were managed with oral medications and resolved. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal for patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride were hypersensitivity (2%) and pyrexia (1%). Table 1 contains the treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of attribution, that were reported in \u2265 5% of patients in either treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study.

These findings confirm the myelosuppressive effects seen in patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride. Red blood cell transfusions were administered to 20% of patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride compared with 6% of patients receiving chlorambucil.

Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients. Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride may also have changes in their creatinine levels. If abnormalities are detected, monitoring of these parameters should be continued to ensure that further deterioration does not occur. Clinical Trials Experience in NHL The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31-84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and <1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles. The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3 . The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (\u226530%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u22655%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions. Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic systems disorders: Pancytopenia Cardiovascular disorders: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation General disorders and administration site conditions: Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling) Immune system disorders: Anaphylaxis Infections and infestations: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."

( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies, intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.6 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) resulted in embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, structural abnormalities, and alterations to growth (see Data ). There are no available data on bendamustine hydrochloride use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to mice from 210 mg/m 2 (approximately 1.8 times the MRHD) during organogenesis and caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (exencephaly, cleft palates, accessory rib, and spinal deformities) and decreased fetal body weights. This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated. Repeat intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine hydrochloride in mice on gestation days 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.6 times the MRHD) and an increase in abnormalities from 112.5 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.9 times the MRHD), similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to rats from 120 mg/m 2 (approximately the MRHD) on gestation days 4, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in external (effect on tail, head, and herniation of external organs [exomphalos]) and internal (hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus) malformations were seen in dosed rats. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bendamustine hydrochloride or its metabolites in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection, and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection. Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Based on findings from clinical studies, Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection may impair male fertility. Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents, especially in combination with other drugs. In some instances, spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission, but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued. Advise patients of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities. Based on findings from animal studies, Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection may impair male fertility due to an increase in morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. The long-term effects of Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection on male fertility, including the reversibility of adverse effects, have not been studied [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy were assessed in a single open-label trial (NCT01088984) in patients aged 1 to 19 years with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient. The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age and younger patients. Efficacy was lower in patients 65 and over with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride based upon an overall response rate of 47% for patients 65 and over and 70% for younger patients. Progression free survival was also longer in younger patients with CLL receiving bendamustine (19 months vs. 12 months).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C max . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m 2 /day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single intravenous dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C max typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied. Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94 to 96% and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 \u03bcg/mL. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 \u03bcg/mL. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg/m 2 of bendamustine over 1 hour, the intermediate half-life (t\u00bd) of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean terminal elimination t\u00bd of two active metabolites, \u03b3-hydroxybendamustine (M3) and N-desmethylbendamustine (M4) are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/min. Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways. Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro. Two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro. M3 and M4 concentrations of these metabolites in plasma are 1/10 th and 1/100 th that of the parent compound, respectively. Excretion Following intravenous infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in cancer patients, approximately 76% of the dose was recovered. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine (3.3% unchanged) and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age (31 to 84 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u2265 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5-3 \u00d7 ULN and AST or ALT 2.5-10 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown. Race/Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects (n=6) were 40% higher than that in non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Effect of Bendamustine on CYP Substrates Bendamustine did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5. Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5. Effect of Transporters on Bendamustine Hydrochloride Bendamustine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)."

The trial was conducted in 301 previously-untreated patients with Binet Stage B or C (Rai Stages I - IV) CLL requiring treatment. Need-to-treat criteria included hematopoietic insufficiency, B-symptoms, rapidly progressive disease or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy. Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Richter\u2019s syndrome, or transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. The patient populations in the bendamustine hydrochloride and chlorambucil treatment groups were balanced with regard to the following baseline characteristics: age (median 63 vs. 66 years), gender (63% vs. 61% male), Binet stage (71% vs. 69% Binet B), lymphadenopathy (79% vs. 82%), enlarged spleen (76% vs. 80%), enlarged liver (48% vs. 46%), hypercellular bone marrow (79% vs. 73%), \u201cB\u201d symptoms (51% vs. 53%), lymphocyte count (mean 65.7x10 9 /L vs. 65.1x10 9 /L), and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (mean 370.2 vs. 388.4 U/L).

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bendamustine hydrochloride at 100 mg/m 2 , administered intravenously over a period of 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 or chlorambucil at 0.8 mg/kg (Broca\u2019s normal weight) administered orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Efficacy endpoints of objective response rate and progression-free survival were calculated using a pre-specified algorithm based on NCI working group criteria for CLL. The results of this open-label randomized study demonstrated a higher rate of overall response and a longer progression-free survival for bendamustine hydrochloride compared to chlorambucil (see Table 5). Survival data are not mature. Table 5: Efficacy Data for CLL CI = confidence interval * CR was defined as peripheral lymphocyte count \u2264 4 x 10 9 /L, neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 10 9 /L, platelets >100 x 10 9 /L, hemoglobin > 110g/L, without transfusions, absence of palpable hepatosplenomegaly, lymph nodes \u2264 1.5 cm, < 30% lymphocytes without nodularity in at least a normocellular bone marrow and absence of \u201cB\u201d symptoms. The clinical and laboratory criteria were required to be maintained for a period of at least 56 days. ** nPR was defined as described for CR with the exception that the bone marrow biopsy shows persistent nodules. \u2020 PR was defined as \u226550% decrease in peripheral lymphocyte count from the pretreatment baseline value, and either \u226550% reduction in lymphadenopathy, or \u226550% reduction in the size of spleen or liver, as well as one of the following hematologic improvements: neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 10 9 /L or 50% improvement over baseline, platelets >100 x 10 9 /L or 50% improvement over baseline, hemoglobin >110g/L or 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions, for a period of at least 56 days. \u2020\u2020 PFS was defined as time from randomization to progression or death from any cause.

Progression-Free Survival Figure 1 14.2 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single arm study of 100 patients with indolent B-cell NHL that had progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 , on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles. The median age was 60 years, 65% were male, and 95% had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma (62%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (21%), and marginal zone lymphoma (16%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy, 91% of patients had received previous alkylator therapy, and 97% of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) and included overall response rate (complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response) and duration of response (DR) as summarized in Table 6 . Table 6: Efficacy Data for NHLError! Hyperlink reference not valid. CI = confidence interval *IRC assessment was based on modified International Working Group response criteria (IWG-RC).

( 2 ) For CLL : 100 mg/m 2 infused intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 28\u00ad-day cycle, up to 6 cycles ( 2.2 ) For NHL : 120 mg/m 2 infused intravenously over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-\u00adday cycle, up to 8 cycles ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Selection of Bendamustine Hydrochloride for Injection Formulation to Administer Bendamustine hydrochloride is available in two formulations, a solution (bendamustine hydrochloride injection) and a lyophilized powder (bendamustine hydrochloride for injection). Bendamustine hydrochloride injection and the reconstituted bendamustine hydrochloride for injection have different concentrations of bendamustine hydrochloride. The concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride in the solution is 90 mg/mL and the concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride in the reconstituted solution of lyophilized powder is 5 mg/mL. Do not mix or combine the two formulations. If a closed system transfer device (CSTD) or adapter that contains polycarbonate or acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene (ABS) is used as supplemental protection prior to dilution 1 , only use bendamustine hydrochloride for injection, the lyophilized powder formulation [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. 2.2 Dosing Instructions for CLL Recommended Dosage: The recommended dose is 100 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 28-day cycle, up to 6 cycles. Dose Delays, Dose Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy for CLL: Delay bendamustine hydrochloride for injection administration in the event of Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or clinically significant \u2265 Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity. Once non-hematologic toxicity has recovered to less than or equal to Grade 1 and/or the blood counts have improved [Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L, platelets \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L], reinitiate bendamustine hydrochloride for injection at the discretion of the treating physician. In addition, consider dose reduction. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 50 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 25 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicity: for clinically significant Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 50 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Consider dose re-escalation in subsequent cycles at the discretion of the treating physician. 2.3 Dosing Instructions for NHL Recommended Dosage: The recommended dose is 120 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day cycle, up to 8 cycles. Dose Delays, Dose Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy for NHL: Delay bendamustine hydrochloride for injection administration in the event of a Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or clinically significant greater than or equal to Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity. Once non-hematologic toxicity has recovered to \u2264 Grade 1 and/or the blood counts have improved [Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L, platelets \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L], reinitiate bendamustine hydrochloride for injection at the discretion of the treating physician. In addition, consider dose reduction. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 4 toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 4 toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. 2.4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration Bendamustine hydrochloride for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Bendamustine hydrochloride for injection (25 mg/vial or 100 mg/vial lyophilized powder) If a closed system transfer device or adapter that contains polycarbonate or ABS is to be used as supplemental protection during preparation 1 , only use bendamustine hydrochloride for injection, the lyophilized formulation. Each vial of bendamustine hydrochloride for injection is intended for single-dose only. Aseptically reconstitute each bendamustine hydrochloride for injection vial as follows: 25 mg bendamustine hydrochloride for injection vial: Add 5 mL of only Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 100 mg bendamustine hydrochloride for injection vial: Add 20 mL of only Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Shake well to yield a clear, colorless to a pale yellow solution with a bendamustine HCl concentration of 5 mg/mL. The lyophilized powder should completely dissolve in 5 minutes. The reconstituted solution must be transferred to the infusion bag within 30 minutes of reconstitution. If particulate matter is observed, the reconstituted product should not be used. Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dose (based on 5 mg/mL concentration) and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline). As an alternative to 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), a 500 mL infusion bag of 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be considered. The resulting final concentration of bendamustine HCl in the infusion bag should be within 0.2 to 0.6 mg/mL. After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. Visually inspect the filled syringe and the prepared infusion bag to ensure the lack of visible particulate matter prior to administration. The admixture should be a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Use Sterile Water for Injection, USP, for reconstitution and then either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for dilution, as outlined above. No other diluents have been shown to be compatible. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any unused solution should be discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics. 2.5 Admixture Stability Bendamustine hydrochloride for injection contain no antimicrobial preservative. The admixture should be prepared as close as possible to the time of patient administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride for injection (25 mg/vial or 100 mg/vial lyophilized powder) Once diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours stored under refrigerated conditions at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) or for 3 hours when stored at room temperature (15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) and room light. Administration of reconstituted and diluted bendamustine hydrochloride for injection must be completed within this period."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression: Delay or reduce dose and restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. ( 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for fever and other signs of infection or reactivation of infections and treat promptly. ( 5.2 ) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): Monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms suggestive of PML. ( 5.3 ) Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe and anaphylactic reactions have occurred; monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. ( 5.4 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: May lead to acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures in patients at high risk. ( 5.5 ) Skin Reactions: Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS, DRESS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment. ( 5.7 ) Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. ( 5.8 ) Extravasation Injury: Take precautions to avoid extravasation, including monitoring intravenous infusion site during and after administration. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3 to 4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV). Monitor complete blood counts, including leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and (2.3) ] 5.2 Infections Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] . Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following bendamustine hydrochloride treatment to contact a physician if they have symptoms or signs of infection. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration. 5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have occurred following treatment with bendamustine, primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, withhold bendamustine hydrochloride treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations. Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 5.4 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusions reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . 5.6 Skin Reactions Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including toxic skin reactions [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)], bullous exanthema, and rash [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] . Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol. Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Combination therapy, progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy. Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during bendamustine therapy. 5.8 Other Malignancies There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, bronchial carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients for the development of secondary malignancies. Perform dermatologic evaluations during and after treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.9 Extravasation Injury Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in postmarketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Assure good venous access prior to starting bendamustine hydrochloride infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of bendamustine hydrochloride. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine (that approximated the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]."

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 153 patients. Bendamustine hydrochloride was studied in an active-controlled, randomized trial. The population was 45 to 77 years of age, 63% male, 100% white, and had treatment na\u00efve CLL. All patients started the study at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days. Adverse reactions were reported according to NCI CTC v.2.0. In the randomized CLL clinical study, non-hematologic adverse reactions (any grade) in the bendamustine hydrochloride group that occurred with a frequency greater than 15% were pyrexia (24%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (16%). Other adverse reactions seen frequently in one or more studies included asthenia, fatigue, malaise, and weakness; dry mouth; somnolence; cough; constipation; headache; mucosal inflammation and stomatitis. Worsening hypertension was reported in 4 patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride in the randomized CLL clinical study and in none treated with chlorambucil. Three of these 4 adverse reactions were described as a hypertensive crisis and were managed with oral medications and resolved. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal for patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride were hypersensitivity (2%) and pyrexia (1%). Table 1 contains the treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of attribution, that were reported in \u2265 5% of patients in either treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study.

Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients. Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride may also have changes in their creatinine levels. If abnormalities are detected, monitoring of these parameters should be continued to ensure that further deterioration does not occur. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31 to 84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and <1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles. The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (\u226530%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u22655%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions. Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic systems disorders: Pancytopenia Cardiovascular disorders: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation General disorders and administration site conditions: Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling) Immune system disorders: Anaphylaxis Infections and infestations: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)"

( 8.3 ) Renal Impairment: Do not use in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. ( 8.6 ) Hepatic Impairment: Do not use in patients with total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 x ULN and AST or ALT 2.5 to 10 x ULN, or total bilirubin >3 x ULN. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies, intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.6 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) resulted in embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, structural abnormalities, and alterations to growth (see Data) . There are no available data on bendamustine hydrochloride use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal data Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to mice from 210 mg/m 2 (approximately 1.8 times the MRHD) during organogenesis and caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (exencephaly, cleft palates, accessory rib, and spinal deformities), and decreased fetal body weights. This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated. Repeat intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine hydrochloride to mice on gestation days 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.6 times the MRHD) and an increase in abnormalities from 112.5 mg/m 2 (approximately 0.9 times the MRHD), similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration. Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to rats from 120 mg/m 2 (approximately the MRHD) on gestation days 4, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in external (effect on tail, head, and herniation of external organs [exomphalos]) and internal (hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus) malformations were seen in dosed rats. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bendamustine hydrochloride or its metabolites in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride, and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride. Contraception Females Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Males Based on findings from clinical studies, bendamustine hydrochloride may impair male fertility. Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents, especially in combination with other drugs. In some instances spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission, but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued. Patients should be warned of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities. Based on findings from animal studies, bendamustine hydrochloride may impair male fertility due to an increase in morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. The long-term effects of bendamustine hydrochloride on male fertility, including the reversibility of adverse effects, have not been studied [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy were assessed in a single open-label trial (NCT01088984) in patients aged 1 to 19 years with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient in the Phase 2 portion of the trial at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 . However, 2 patients with ALL achieved CR at a dose of 90 mg/m 2 in the Phase 1 portion of the study. The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between patients \u226565 years of age and younger patients. Efficacy was lower in patients 65 and over with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride based upon an overall response rate of 47% for patients 65 and over and 70% for younger patients. Progression free survival was also longer in younger patients with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride (19 months vs. 12 months). No overall differences in efficacy in patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 mL/min. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Do not use bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with AST or ALT 2.5 to 10 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN, or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C max . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30\u00ad-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m 2 /day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post-infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single intravenous dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C max typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied. Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94 to 96% and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 mcg/mL. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg/m 2 of bendamustine over 1 hour, the intermediate half-life (t \u00bd ) of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean terminal elimination t\u00bd of two active metabolites, \u03b3\u00ad-hydroxybendamustine (M3) and N desmethylbendamustine (M4) are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, respectively. Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/min. Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways. Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro . Two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro . M3 and M4 concentrations in plasma are 1/10 th and 1/100 th that of the parent compound, respectively. Excretion Following intravenous infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in cancer patients, approximately 76% of the dose was recovered. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine (3.3% unchanged) and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2. Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age (31 to 84 years), sex, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u2265 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and AST or ALT 2.5 to 10 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown. Race/Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects (n=6) were 40% higher than that in non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Effect of Bendamustine on CYP Substrates Bendamustine did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5. Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5.

Need-to-treat criteria included hematopoietic insufficiency, B-symptoms, rapidly progressive disease or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy. Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Richter\u2019s syndrome, or transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study.

Ninety percent of patients in both treatment groups had immuno-phenotypic confirmation of CLL (CD5, CD23 and either CD19 or CD20 or both). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bendamustine hydrochloride at 100 mg/m 2 , administered intravenously over a period of 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 or chlorambucil at 0.8 mg/kg (Broca\u2019s normal weight) administered orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Efficacy endpoints of objective response rate and progression-free survival were calculated using a pre-specified algorithm based on NCI working group criteria for CLL. The results of this open-label randomized study demonstrated a higher rate of overall response and a longer progression-free survival for bendamustine hydrochloride compared to chlorambucil (see Table 5). Survival data are not mature. Table 5: Efficacy Data for CLL CI = confidence interval * CR was defined as peripheral lymphocyte count \u2264 4.0 x 10 9 /L, neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 10 9 /L, platelets >100 x 10 9 /L, hemoglobin > 110 g/L, without transfusions, absence of palpable hepatosplenomegaly, lymph nodes \u2264 1.5 cm, < 30% lymphocytes without nodularity in at least a normocellular bone marrow and absence of \u201cB\u201d symptoms. The clinical and laboratory criteria were required to be maintained for a period of at least 56 days. ** nPR was defined as described for CR with the exception that the bone marrow biopsy shows persistent nodules. \u2020 PR was defined as \u2265 50% decrease in peripheral lymphocyte count from the pretreatment baseline value, and either \u226550% reduction in lymphadenopathy, or \u226550% reduction in the size of spleen or liver, as well as one of the following hematologic improvements: neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 10 9 /L or 50% improvement over baseline, platelets >100 x 10 9 /L or 50% improvement over baseline, hemoglobin >110 g/L or 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions, for a period of at least 56 days. \u2020\u2020 PFS was defined as time from randomization to progression or death from any cause.

Figure 1. Progression-Free Survival 14.2 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single arm study of 100 patients with indolent B-cell NHL that had progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 , on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles. The median age was 60 years, 65% were male, and 95% had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma (62%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (21%), and marginal zone lymphoma (16%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy, 91% of patients had received previous alkylator therapy, and 97% of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) and included overall response rate (complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response) and duration of response (DR) as summarized in Table 6. Table 6: Efficacy Data for NHL* CI = confidence interval *IRC assessment was based on modified International Working Group response criteria (IWG\u00ad-RC). Modifications to IWG-RC specified that a persistently positive bone marrow in patients who met all other criteria for CR would be scored as PR. Bone marrow sample lengths were not required to be \u226520 mm.
